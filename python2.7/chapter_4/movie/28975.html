<PRE>THE SCORE (2001)
Reviewed by Jerry Saravia
July 25th, 2001</PRE>
<P>Heist dramas are fashionable again. David Mamet has his own upcoming drama 
aptly titled "Heist." Ben Kingsley's riveting performance in the film "Sexy 
Beast" also involves a heist. Now, director Frank Oz ("Bowfinger") and three 
major stars, Robert De Niro, Edward Norton and Marlon Brando, combine their 
strengths to create their own caper flick. "The Score" is a thrilling 
character study, depending more on specifics related to the heist than with 
character. Still, it is as relaxing and comforting a film as you are likely 
to see in a mindless, mind-boggling summer. </P>
<P>De Niro stars as Nick, a Montreal jazz club owner who masquerades as an 
efficient burglar. Nick is one of the best in the business, usually 
performing jobs for others in places outside of what he refers to as his own 
backyard. He has a stunning girlfriend (Angela Bassett), an airline 
stewardess, who visits him infrequently ("I'll see yah when I see yah.") 
Everything is in place for Nick but he looks like he is ready to quit too. 
That is until a shady, Sydney Greenstreet character named Max (Marlon 
Brando), an old friend of Nick's, offers Nick one big job in their own 
backyard. It turns out that the Montreal Customs House has a rare, 17th 
century French scepter in the basement, its value higher than Brando's last 
paycheck. The scepter is so valuable that it is placed under strict 
surveillance, namely video cameras and an invisible laser display. There is 
also a little snag and an inconvenience for Nick: Max has hired a cocky, 
seemingly sociopathic thief named Jackie Teller (Edward Norton) to help 
infiltrate the Customs House. It turns out Jackie works at the Customs House 
as a janitor named Brian, mimicking and fooling the employees into believing 
he is mentally challenged. He is in place already, it only takes Nick to 
perform the actual heist with Jackie's help. </P>
<P>Needless to say, "The Score" fits the description of any heist thriller since 
the days of the Production Code. How many heist thrillers have had the same 
basic premise? How many have dealt with a character like Nick who sees this 
score as his last job, for good and ever? How many involve a virtually silent 
climax where the thief performs his sweat-inducing work amidst false alarms? 
The difference is in all the details, and there are enough to entertain and 
jolt audiences out of their seats. </P>
<P>De Niro is one of my favorite actors, ranging from explosive portrayals of 
sinful men in "Taxi Driver" and "Raging Bull" to comedic highlights of 
minimalistic strength in "Wag the Dog" and "Meet the Parents." Lately, he has 
been saddled with mediocre fare such as "Fifteen Minutes" but what can you 
say about a man of his stature to keep himself from repeating past roles? 
Well, Nick is not unlike the ice-cold killer thief De Niro played in "Heat." 
This time, though, De Niro brings a world-weariness sense to the role and one 
can't help but feel that Nick enjoys his job as well - he is in command and 
refuses to take orders except from his boss. </P>
<P>Edward Norton continues to impress me. Here he seems like an extension of the 
duality he prominently displayed in "Primal Fear" and "The Fight Club." It is 
a frightening performance in the sense that his character Jackie seems 
explosive yet reserved at the same time, willing to listen to Nick yet just 
as ready to rebel from the old-timers. His cockiness and energy are, in 
effect, part of his own undoing. How can Jackie feel superior to thieves who 
have far more experience than he ever will? </P>
<P>Marlon Brando is a whole other matter. Brando seems intent on doing riffs of 
Sydney Greenstreet and the resemblance is amazing not to mention intentional. 
But there is that glee and weariness he brings that fills the screen with 
delight. His scene with De Niro is wonderful to watch, but not quite as 
potent as say the unique pairing of De Niro and Pacino in "Heat." Still, 
watching Brando mingle with De Niro and Norton is a pleasure to behold. And 
Brando's scene at an empty pool where he confesses to De Niro the truth 
behind the heist is exquisite. </P>
<P>Director Frank Oz is a strange choice for this kind of material since his 
background is in the comedy genre. Still, he proves to be a master of tension 
and suspense in some notable scenes, particularly the heist itself which is 
among the most electrifying since "Topkapi." It is so good that my palms were 
sweaty while watching it. It is on par with the climactic underwater heist in 
"Sexy Beast." </P>
<P>Oz's work with these acting giants also proves to be superlative (Despite 
rumors to the contrary, Brando seems effortless on screen thanks to Oz, even 
if he didn't want to be directed by Miss Piggy). One misguided exception in 
the casting is the underwritten role of Angela Bassett as Nick's girlfriend - 
a character that exists merely as a reason for Nick to quit. Only Bassett is 
too strong a presence for such a throwaway role - either eliminate the role 
or hire Halle Berry, for goodness sakes'! There is strong evidence that her 
role had been severely cut which is a shame since it would have shed some 
light on Nick's priorities in life. </P>
<P>"The Score" is as pleasant and diverting a surprise as one can expect. It is 
absolutely nothing new but the acting, script and the heist climax makes it 
more than worthwile. It is not as character-driven as "Sexy Beast" or Michael 
Mann's powerful "Thief," nor as wire-tight as Kubrick's fast-paced "The 
Killing." Nevertheless, it is still watchable, tense and sweat-inducing as 
any good heist thriller should be. Unless you believe that all films should 
have digitally created characters, nothing beats a score like three diamonds 
in the rough - De Niro, Brando and Norton. </P>
