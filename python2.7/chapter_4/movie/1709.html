<PRE>                                   MALCOLM X
                       A film review by Malcolm Austin
                        Copyright 1993 Malcolm Austin</PRE>
<P>     Personally, I think the most significant aspect of this movie is
the likelihood that, given the discussion about the film and its
subject, millions of people will finally learn how to spell "Malcolm."
But that's just me.</P>
<P>     As usual, Spike Lee the director has far outshone Spike Lee the
media twerp.  This movie is an excellent portrayal of the continuing
evolution of a man's thought.  It is marred by a few touches of
oliverstonism, such as vague (and unsupportable, from the movie's
internal evidence) intimations that the CIA was involved with Malcolm
X's death, and a tacked on prologue and epilogue, featuring the Rodney
King film intercut with a burning American flag, and, in the most
unintentionally horrific scene in modern filmdom, Nelson Mandela
lecturing to school children.</P>
<P>     But in between these lapses into political dreck, there is a truly
outstanding movie.  It is testament, I think, to the craft of this film
that, despite its three-and-a-half-hour length, I didn't even glance at
my watch until almost three hours had gone by.  Like other great
biographical epics, such as LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, or PATTON, this movie
just doesn't seem as long as it is.</P>
<P>     Spike Lee has largely muted his style in this movie, so it almost
looks like "typical" Hollywood fare.  However, there remains evidence of
his directorial flare.  Most notable is the very different looks he
achieves for different parts of the film, as Malcolm X's story unfolds.
The flashy Harlem beginning contrasts with the austere prison scenes,
and the lush photography of Malcolm's years with the Nation of Islam,
and finally the spiritual and almost surreal period of Malcolm's hadj,
and the final period of his life afterwards.</P>
<P>     Without more research, I can't say how accurate the portrayal of
Malcolm X is, but as myth-making, this film is wonderful.  It is easily
Spike Lee's most impressive accomplishment.</P>
