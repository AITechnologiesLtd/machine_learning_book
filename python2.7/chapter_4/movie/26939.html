<PRE>                              UNBREAKABLE
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     With the long-awaited release of M. Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable,
the moviegoing world has one question on its mind: will it be
unexpectedly great like his last film The Sixth Sense, or will it
unexpectedly suck eggs like his first film Wide Awake?</P>
<P>     Sadly, the answer is neither, though an overexcited populace
spoon-fed on a year's worth of hype is likely to lean toward the latter
owing to severe disappointment.  It's hard to blame them.</P>
<P>     This time out we're back to gloomy Philadelphia in a story about
one David Dunne (Bruce Willis), a security guard who wakes up after a
catastrophic train wreck to discover he is the sole survivor of the
crash, with nary a scratch on his body.  The next day David finds a
cryptic note on his windshield, leading him to the Biblically-inspired
Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), a comic book dealer with a fragile
bone disease that has crippled him.  Elijah tries to convince David that
he is possessed of superhuman strength and is, as the title suggests,
"unbreakable."</P>
<P>     David pooh-poohs the idea, but slowly he begins to accept the
possibility that, yes, he can't be hurt, but he can lose his hair.  Will
Bruce become our first major superhero with male pattern baldness?</P>
<P>     At this point, Unbreakable had me (and likely everyone else)
wondering if I was in the right movie.  From the trailers and the
advance press, wasn't this supposed to be some kind of metaphysical
exploration of the meaning of life and death, about how a man learned
some secret of the universe that's eluded us for all these years,
perhaps, all due to a fluke train crash?  What the hell, we ask, is all
this superhero crap?</P>
<P>     Putting the story aside for a moment, Unbreakable is extremely
competent in the hands of its crew, coming together on a slow burn as
bit by bit of the story is revealed, just like in The Sixth Sense. 
Sure, it's a little overindulgent, as every other scene is photographed
upside-down, reflected in a TV, or some other such trickery, but it
keeps you interested in watching (and the superhero zaniness may incline
you otherwise).</P>
<P>     And just as you're about to get sucked in, there goes Jackson,
being forced as if at knifepoint to utter lines like, "It's like
kryptonite," with total seriousness.  The mind begins to reel.  The
movie begins to suffer.  And even a now-trademark M. Night Big Plot
Twist At The End won't change your mind.  (Overheard from one Disney
publicist during the screening: "It's one of those movies that grows on
you."  We'll see.)</P>
<P>     Ultimately, Unbreakable is an extremely charming and well-produced
film about something that's so silly and unbelievable it makes you
wonder why people went to all the trouble to put it together.  But
ironically, Unbreakable could have worked extremely well as a real
superhero movie.  Say you change the title to The Protector and make it
the story of a regular guy who suddenly finds out he's a superhero, and
get rid of all the overwrought train crashes and such.</P>
<P>     Or better yet, make it a movie called Unbreakable, and it's about a
guy who learns the meaning of life and death... some secret of the
universe that's eluded us for all these years.</P>
