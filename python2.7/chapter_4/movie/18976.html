<PRE>                          ONE TRUE THING 1999
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1999 Timothy Voon
                  3 out of 5 for tragedy in the family</PRE>
<P>Cast:  Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger, William Hurt.
Screenplay:  Karen Croner, based on the novel by Anna Quindlen.
Producers:  Harry Ufland and Jesse Burton.
Director:  Carl Franklin.</P>
<P>This movie should have a profound effect on people's understanding of
life and death, but somehow ends up being less effective than it could
have been, because it diverts its attention away from a mother's need
and focuses instead on a daughter's plight.</P>
<P>In this pandemonium of personal and family problems, we learn more than
we need to know about poor family dynamics. We have a mother (Meryl
Streep) who has given her life over to serving her family and helping
her husband achieve his dreams. A father (William Hurt) who is on the
surface an accomplished professor, but beneath the smooth exterior lacks
any character strength. A daughter (Renee Zellweger) and a son who are
constantly living in the shadow of their ‘great' father, and who are
unable live up to his high expectations for them.</P>
<P>It becomes apparent how important the role of the mother is to this
family, when she starts dying. The fabric that holds them all together
slowly begins to tear. Her husband is unable to cope with the situation
and unfairly unloads his responsibilities on a daughter, who is only
beginning to realise how great her mother is. Unfortunately, too much
time is spent exploring the daughter's dilemma of caring for her sick
mother, and not enough time is spent exploring the fears of the one who
is dying of cancer.</P>
<P>The other issue that is brought out in this movie is the need for cancer
sufferers to die with dignity. It is rather unfortunate that this movie
paints the picture of someone asking for euthanasia because of
inadequate pain control. I believe this is a biased, incorrect view of
cancer sufferers. With current medical treatments, suicide because of
inadequate pain control is not a valid option. However, the
deterioration of quality of life is a more difficult issue to address
and in this case, may have tipped the scales of life and death.</P>
