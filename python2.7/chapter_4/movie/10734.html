<P>   "The Gingerbread Man" may not imitate the daily headlines
as much as "Wag the Dog," but it does show into what
troubles a man can be dragged if he thinks with a part of his
body other than his head. Current events in American politics
notwithstanding, sexual conduct with the wrong person by
people high in authority has driven narratives ever since
Agamemnon was murdered by Clytemnestra.  In this movie,
in which John Grisham bypassed the book and scripted
directly for the screen, a lawyer who has never lost a case in
eight years becomes careless and forfeits the one litigation
that would hurt him the most.  "The Gingerbread Man" takes
Grisham somewhat afield of his usual tales: this time his film
is directed by Robert Altman, who is known to forego
structure for atmosphere: who does just that in adeptly
capturing the shadowy, sinewy, and stormy surroundings of
Savannah.  But Altman forgoes the laid-back, discontinuous
structure of his most famous film, "Nashville" in favor of a
taut, suspenseful, and occasionally violent work with a
surprisingly effective twist in its concluding quarter hour.</P>
<P>   Backed up by a team of major performers like Kenneth
Branagh, Tom Berenger, Robert Duvall and the upcoming
Embert Davidtz, Altman's film opens with his signature scene,
a large, catered party--a surprise to celebrate lawyer Rick
Magruder's big victory in gaining the release of a man who
shot a cop.  It's the sort of case that does not make lawyers
into the heroes of police precincts and prompts even a private
investigator hired by Magruder to quip (about an attorney who
committed suicide) that at least one guy in the profession has
a conscience.  </P>
<P>   During the party, Magruder's speech slurs over as he
sloshes down some drinks and, when on a stormy night he
witnesses a car theft at the expense of its owner, Mallory
Doss (who served as part of the catering staff), he drives her
home in his chic red Mercedes.  After a tempestuous night of
lovemaking, the divorced Magruder takes a liking to his new
friend and decides to help her out, having learned that the
alleged car thief is her own, insane father--who has been
stalking her for years.  His efforts to get the nutty father,
Dixon Doss (Robert Duvall) locked up include his hiring of a
laid-back private investigator, Clyde (Robert Downey jr.), the
subpoena-forced testimony of Mallory's hostile ex-husband,
peter Randall (Tom Berenger), and the witnessing of several
fires including the blowing up of Mallory's car.</P>
<P>   Altman's direction, however taut, takes its time in exposing
the lives of his characters, particularly the dilemmas faced by
the rich and successful lawyer whose problems do not allow
him to enjoy his position to the fullest.  Chief among these
difficulties is his own marital situation: he is divorced with
custody of two small children whom he loves and his ex-wife
Leeanne (Famke Janssen) is anything but supportive of his
custodial visits.  Unwisely, he rejects the advice of his
associate in the law firm, the statuesque Lois (Daryl Hannah),
who warns him regularly about his activities with bimbos and
obviously cares quite a bit for him.  </P>
<P>   Branagh, it turns out, can enjoy slumming.  The English
actor takes a breaks from his usual Shakespearean roles to
adopt a southern American accent and a goatee, and appears
in virtually every one of photographer Changwei Gu's scenes. 
While Mr.Changwei expertly capitalizes on Savannah's old-
world beauty, too many vistas take place in poorly-lit indoor
locations, including Magruder's pine-panelled law office and
the bar which constitutes Clyde's hangout and pick-up spot for
bimbettes.  Daryl Hannah plays well against type as the
bespectacled lawyer's aide as does the lovely, slim Embeth
Davidtz who may not be quite the angel she was with Denzel
Washington in "Fallen."</P>
<P>   The first part is the more interesting one: the picture turns
increasingly melodramatic and difficult to accept.  Far too
often the heavy rain and routine, melodramatic actions remind
us of the cloudburst-soaked film, "Hard Rain," and we lose the
wit and clever dialogue that make the initial scenes
particularly Altmanesque and thereby compelling.  Mark
Isham's music is most effective, becoming menacing as the
movie progresses into the dark Savannah night. Rated R. 
Running Time: 115 minutes.  (C) 1998 Harvey Karten</P>
