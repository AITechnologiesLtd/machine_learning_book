<PRE>                              HEAVEN & EARTH
                       A film review by Ralf Benner
                        Copyright 1995 Ralf Benner</PRE>
<P>     Perhaps somewhere in the annals of forgotten intentions, director
Oliver Stone might have said to some hack reporter that he had always
had in mind a trilogy of movies about the Vietnam War.  The first,
PLATOON, about the actual war itself from a G.I.'s perspective; the
second, BORN ON THE 4TH OF JULY, about a war hero who returns to
America to discover he's more despised than hailed; and a
third--WHEAVEN & EARTH bring this up because one of Stone's problems
has always been his inability to one-on-one sell his own product
because he's constantly shifting positions: he seems to say one thing
one day about his movies, and yet in another interview on another day
say something else entirely, often contradicting himself.  This was
most obvious and disturbing when conservatives jumped all over him
about JFK; Stone wouldn't admit that, as a refuter, he rigged his grand
mal of invective against the Warren Report.  Instead he fulminated
against his critics for perpetuating the grander lie.  Fair minded
viewers quickly perceived that JFK was a composite of theories, not
really meant to be at all definitive but exploratory--spasms of
conjecture to tantalize and reel us with possibilities and at the same
time admonish us for acquiescing to the volumes of purported facts.
JFK was dazzling, work-me-over movie making in the worst traditions of
yellow press muckraking: when we left the theatre, we conjured up the
worst scenarios for just about everybody, and this kind of cynicism was
and remains the movie's clarion attraction.  With an eye on the box
office, Stone elicited his detractors' often meaningless barrages--I'm
thinking of some of George Will's pomposity in defending status
quo--and never truer than when, on 60 Minutes, Andy Rooney made an ass
of himself (and unwittingly confirmed Stone's legitimate deploring of a
lazy press before the National Press Club in Washington) by trying to
joke that Stone was this era's Orson Welles looking for his Rosebud.
JFK is not Stone's CITIZEN KANE.  Far from it.  Had the movies'
preeminent contrarian shown class instead of boxing himself in, he
might have said that he made his own and much more exciting, horrifying
and brutal MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.</P>
<P>     It is of course the quicksand that Stone, equal parts product and
producer of media splurge, can't resist: he likes to go the edges of
the pits he creates, and even if he tumbles into some of them, as he
did as writer for the exploiting MIDNIGHT EXPRESS and as director for
BORN ON THE 4TH OF JULY, somehow he rescues himself by sheer gall and
temerity, which, as Americans, we often cheer more than we do those who
show respect for history or nations other than our own.  These are
movies that Stone owes us an apology for; these two false, pitched
melodramas, reeking with fabricated scenes and utterances and ultra-bad
casting (Tom Cruise as a paraplegic vet?), received the kind of
attention that later embarrasses the rational-minded--we realize that
all the hysteria comes from vengeful emotionality, in order to subvert
and controvert facts and humiliations.  There's not a god damn thing
that's admirable about Billy Hayes's story in MIDNIGHT EXPRESS; and
there's only pitiful contempt for those who continue to fight the
Vietnam War until they somehow win what they deserved to lose.</P>
<P>     Stone's frenzied method of reportage is undeniably what makes him
suspicious to many of us--he takes "true stories" and propagandizes not
the factual incidents themselves but the circumstances surrounding
them.  It's defensible with JFK because Stone was using thirty years
worth of everyone else's conspiracies and suppositions.  It's
indefensible regarding the overwrought BORN ON THE 4TH OF JULY: as
pointed out by others, reel-life Ron Kovic evaded the major question:
"Why did the government tell lies about what the Vietnam War was
about?"  Because PLATOON was based, more or less, on Stone's own
experiences during the Vietnam War, questioning his veracity would be
dangerous, and I didn't when I first saw the movie, and, despite my
strong misgivings about HEAVEN & EARTH, I don't now.  PLATOON had the
feel of truth, of real experience in it, and I think the reactions of
our nation's Vietnam Vets was--and remains--the more significant
testimonial.  They responded to it as if it were a catharsis; they left
theatres shaken, or crying, or sobbing, their pain of waste &
dissolution given a salve.  When Jane Fonda attacked THE DEER HUNTER as
racist, she was once more pounced on as a traitor, but this time she
was absolutely right: Michael Cimino made a political tract that only
temporarily gave us the excuse we sought to feel smug and superior to a
tiny country that, short of nuking, we attempted to bomb into oblivion
and in the process helped kill more than two million of its citizens
and injured another three million.  This is why few can watch that
movie anymore--it being so egregiously slanted to protect ourselves
from our own crimes.  And this is most likely why PLATOON had such an
incredible impact only nine years later: despite all the amateurish
literary flourishes spoken by Charlie Sheen, despite the appallingly
effective misuse of Barber's "Adagio for Strings" during some of the
movie's most horrific moments, PLATOON was an "everyman's" epiphany of
our government's nearly intractable dumbheadedness.  And it did
something more:  it intimated how frequently our military's hierarchy
left our men in the lurch, to defend themselves and die as their
commanders, in the relative safety of Saigon or Washington, were lying
to an American press.  One of the quietly satisfying aspects about the
success of PLATOON is that while some movie critics, National Guard
right-wingers and draft-dodgers were proclaiming that they "didn't like
it," the fact is, this is categorically not a movie to like or dislike,
to love or hate; based on one's own experiences, you're either moved by
what it's saying and suggesting or you're not.  I knew this movie was
and would stay on the right track when, during its opening, we watched
the new G.I.s getting off their transports as others--in body
bags--were being loaded onto those transports.  I've still got in my
memory banks many images of the war, but none more evoking of stronger
emotions than this.  I'm a Vietnam-era vet who unaccountably spent his
term of service in the Baroque whimsy of Wurzburg, Germany and whose
cushy job it was to administratively process servicemen to and from
other military posts and during interviews with those who had been to
Vietnam, the reactions were almost always the same:  the initial shock
and sudden realization of possible death when they saw the rows of
corpses.  Those images were never discussed in basic and individual
training, those images hadn't yet appeared in Stars & Stripes, they
were rarely spoken of on Armed Forces Radio, but they were the subject
of endless conversations in the barracks, in the mess halls.  We didn't
know what post traumatic stress syndrome was in those days--it probably
hadn't even been coined yet--but we could tell who served in Vietnam
when we heard the screams from hellish nightmares during the night.</P>
<P>     HEAVEN & EARTH, based on two non-fiction books that are accounts
of Vietnamese surviving their country's war years, opens with
paradisical shots of agricultural lands and jutting mountains with low
clouds passing through them--the kind of setting one might imagine
would be the end result of the Genesis Device in STAR TREK: THE WRATH
OF KHAN.  The beauty of it all is Stone saying, "This is what it was
like before we got there." Soon after, when the American helicopters
and napalm arrive, we get the burnt out fields and villages, with Stone
lecturing, "This is what it was like after we got there."  Stone has
said repeatedly that HEAVEN & EARTH is a glimpse of what the Vietnamese
went through during the time the French and most specifically the
Americans descended upon them.  But HEAVEN & EARTH is not about the
Vietnamese proles--it's about an American movie maker's view of what a
Vietnamese woman, lucky enough to escape, endures through
Americanization.  This is not a minor quibble, it's a major beef.  This
is no more a movie about how the Vietnamese people lived through the
inferno mostly created by other nations--China, France, Japan, France
again, America, and China once more--than BORN ON THE 4TH OF JULY is
about a disillusioned war hero returning to a jaded homeland.  HEAVEN &
EARTH is not overtly fraudulent--there probably isn't a major scene
that didn't happen to either the principals or others--but it feels
very fraudulent.  Except for a few terrorist threats by (we assume) the
Viet Cong, who warn the peasant farmers against betraying the
motherland, there's no believability that these Vietnamese have any
defining politics or even pride in nationality.  Worse, the bits and
pieces of their struggles to maintain a crazy kind of normalcy in daily
living amidst the incursions are, if not rehash from all the other
Vietnam War movies, then cursory.  Were there no schools for the kids?
Did no teens or young adults date and fall in love? There's a flimsy,
slow-motion reach towards Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS a la APOCALYPSE
NOW to remind us of war's inherent insanity but eventually the movie
tires itself out and becomes a rather mild, less affecting KILLING
FIELDS--we even get Haing S.  Nor as a loving father searching for his
pregnant daughter, reminiscent of Sam Waterston's pursuit of Nor
himself.</P>
<P>     During the opening, we get a very truncated narration by the
movie's heroine--played by newcomer Hiep Thi Le--that attempts to
establish perfunctory facts.  The facts are misleading: while I
couldn't swear to what Stone has her saying exactly, because it's
soft-spoken enough to miss parts, there is a major reference to the
defeat of the French (at Dien Bien Phu) in 1954, which, by Stone's
account, precipitated American intervention.  Not quite right: though
the French did depart in 1954, and though there was a brief diplomatic
solution known as the Geneva Accord which separated Vietnam into North
and South, providing a lull in major fighting until 1959 when Ho Chi
Minh stepped up gorilla warfare to further weaken the South's already
precarious government, and though the U.S. was sending "advisors"
steadily until 1965 when President Johnson ordered large numbers of
troops to intervene to save the South, the American government, under
Truman, was already and very directly involved in the re-colonization
of Indochina by France in 1946.</P>
<P>     While FDR adamantly and Truman less so opposed France's return
there, because it defied the American principle of independence for all
nations, and though both presidents were suspicious of France in that
it had cruelly exploited Vietnam in the past and despite France's
promise to grant autonomy to the Vietnamese probably wouldn't (and
didn't), the American position became one of acquiescence to France,
most likely because Charles de Gaulle, humiliated by the quick,
humiliating subjugation of his people to the Nazis, blackmailed
Truman:  If not permitted its undeserved spoils of the war, then
France, already haughty with demands in the rebuilding of Europe, would
resist cooperation in that reconstruction.  France's return to
Vietnam--facilitated by over 2 billion American 1940-50 dollars worth
of transport ships and materials--enraged Ho Chi Minh rather
understandably: America, a nation he had admired enormously, was
betraying its principles, especially since Ho believed that, with the
American pledge to grant independence to the Philippines, America
indeed "was for the free popular governments all over the world and
that it opposed colonialism in all its forms." (Ho had been appealing
for his nation's independence since 1919, when he went to the
Versailles Peace Conference to plead his case, but he had been turned
away without so much as a single hearing.) By late 1945, Ho had sent at
least eight appeals to Truman and the American Secretary of State, but
they were ignored.  War between the French and the Vietnamese started
in late 1946 and would continue until the French were surrounded and
nearly annihilated at Dien Bien Phu.  The ominous but ignored cost to
the French: over 50,000 lives, 100,000 injuries.  Part of Ho's brief
triumph when the French departed was the knowledge that he also
defeated America the betrayer.  Though Ho died before his countrymen
would defeat America a second time, there must be among Vietnamese an
additional yet savory satisfaction in the victory: that we did not
learn from history, even failing to learn from yesterday's failed
military tactics.  In a communique written in 1945 to de Gaulle by Bao
Dai, the last Emperor of Indochina, this was prophesied: "Even if you
come to re-establish a French administration here, it will no longer be
obeyed: each village will be a nest of resistance, each former
collaborator an enemy, and your officials and colonists will themselves
ask to leave this atmosphere which they will unable to breathe."</P>
<P>     Technically, none of this is what the movie is all about, but
remember, it's Stone who's telling us that he's made a
people-of-Vietnam movie from their perspective, which, reiterating, he
most certainly is not.  What HEAVEN & EARTH seems to be about is karma,
and rather tragi-yellow karma to boot: it suggests that the sum and
consequences of the heroine's life determined her fate--that she might
have deserved to be raped, that she was destined to meet and marry
psycho Sad Sack Tommy Lee Jones, that despite her capitalist success in
America she would return home to hear her brother scold her and America
for its continual punishment of her motherland that never deserved to
be the pawn it became in global power strategies.  As such, Hiep Thi
Le, a pre-med student in California, is surprisingly competent.  Like
the abused, neglected heroines proverbially carrying coals to New
Castle in American period-piece literature, Hiep Thi Le is required to
be weighted down and become the embodiment of the rice-fed Vietnamese
constitution; despite the upholstery-like coifs that make her look
stereotypically China Doll trampy, she sticks to you. (She's also got
the movie's only honest bit: when she jumps off a helicopter, with
child in tow, her purse falls to her knees, then feet.  She's also in a
scene that puts the fact checkers on the spot: there's a banner
advertising "double coupons" at the California grocery chain Ralphs.)</P>
<P>     The last time I saw Joan Chen, who plays Hiep's mother, was in
Bertolucci's snoozer THE LAST EMPEROR.  So fancily pictorial she seemed
a poster; there was more drama in the lobby stills of her than in the
movie itself.  And there was something unconvincing about her makeup:
she didn't age "naturally," she looked comically fakey.  This doesn't
happen to her here: while it takes time to get passed her mouth full of
rotten dentistry (or a lack of it, I could never tell for sure), she's
stunningly cosmeticized, you really believe what you see.  Her voice and
face now have a nobility you can't stop absorbing--she's a hybrid of
Glenn Close and Jessica Lange, with a slight amount of Olivia Cole as a
finishing touch.  In her last scenes, you realize it is her story that
you want to see, that she is the salt of Vietnam's earth Stone has
tried to turn Hiep Thi Le into.  This odd reversal happened in THE LAST
EMPEROR: at the beginning, when the dying empress, sounding like Meryl
Streep doing her OUT OF AFRICA routine, informed the young emperor
he'll inherit the throne, we're mesmerized: she's so debauched,
evil-eyed and practically levitating in the splendiferous surroundings
of the imperial palace--not unlike Jabba the Hut in THE RETURN OF THE
JEDI--that when the movie concluded, I flashed back to her, regretting
that I didn't see THE LAST EMPRESS.  When Hiep delivers the earth
mother bromides--the kind of platitudes all mothers want to hear, and,
in fact, HEAVEN & EARTH is dedicated to Stone's own mother--it's Joan
Chen who should be speaking.</P>
<P>     Someday a director will pick up THE TUNNELS OF CU CHI by Tom
Mangold and John Penycate and realize it's the book that America needs
as a movie.  (Anyone who's read it never forgets the snake.) With Mel
Gibson, whose frame and Stoogy risk-taking are perfect for traversing
those tunnels which terrorized Americans and are, in any variety of
ways, the real metaphor of Vietnam.  Without them, without the tenacity
involved in building and maintaining them, it might have been possible
for the American military killing experts to defeat the spirit of the
Vietnamese.  The only movie that has come close to showing the terror
of those tunnels--but too briefly--is Brian De Palma's over-praised
and rightly rebuffed CASUALTIES OF WAR.  Though CASUALTIES OF WAR is
based on fact, it loses its indictable punch in that rape and the death
of the raped aren't exclusive to the horror of war; movies using rape to
pontificate become cliches because, in a measure of our desensitized
times, rape is no longer as horrible as it is anticipatory symptom, and
it never explains the political machinations that result in war.
According to a blurb Pauline Kael gave to De Palma to use in the ads--a
blurb that did not show up in her lengthy review--CASUALTIES OF WAR is
the "greatest of the Vietnam War movies."  Similar to Larry King's
fourteen word blurb about HEAVEN & EARTH, hyperbolic nonsense has a way
of biting back, like bad karma.  The ultimate Vietnam War movie would
be the one that shows us that the enemy who never had to be knew us and
our weaknesses better than we did.  The more self-incriminating
anti-war movie will be the one that reveals American
immaturity--exposing our national inability to accept the harsher
reality of having lost a war we never had any business getting involved
in.  Vietnam vets have a right to rage against Robert McNamara and his
IN RETROSPECT.  One of the principal architects of youth in Asia,
McNamara acknowledges the war's meaninglessness, but, having learned
from the right wing crybabies, he blames everyone else.</P>
