<PRE>KUNDUN</PRE>

<P>   In 1949 the Communists took over the mainland of China
and by 1950 had solidified their hold on the previously
independent Tibet.  The Dalai Lama, after giving the political
situation much thought, went along with his chief adviser and
fled to India to form a government-in-exile--where he still
resides today.  After you watch Martin Scorsese's film,
"Kundun," however, you may conclude that a different
strategy could have proved far better.  This fourteenth
incarnation of Buddha--played by four actors who portray His
Holiness from the age of two to his eighteenth year--should
have remained in the Tibetan capital where he would have
bored the entire invading Chinese army to death.</P>
<P>   Director Scorsese could hardly have had this subtext in
mind but he has perhaps unwittingly portrayed his Ocean of
Wisdom (as Dalai Lama translates to English) as a young
fella with all the bedside manner of a Dr. Kevorkian and the
charm of a junior accountant working his way through the
exams to become an actuary.  Well, now, nobody says that
everything Scorsese does has to carry the electricity of "Taxi
Driver."  His "Last Temptation of Christ" is probably the film
most like "Kundun" in that it represents one of America's great
directors journeying within.  But when a movie proceeds step
by step as a chronicle with banal dialogue, little action (but
some great visuals, admittedly), you might find yourself
screaming to introduce a rugged Nazi like Brad Pitt's Heinrich
Harrar from "Seven Years in Tibet."  Not a chance.  "Kundun"
is a meditation that would embarrass even some Zen masters
who face a blank wall for eight hours daily.  What sort of
target audience did Scorsese have in mind for this heartfelt
albeit static drama?  Your typical fourteen-year-old would
have little patience for this PG-13 tale and adults will soon tire
of a film which can best recommended for Philip Glass's
super sound track and some dazzling desert scenes filmed in
southern Morocco where hundreds of nonprofessional
Tibetans were transported.  (It is, incidentally, to Morocco's
credit that the almost exclusively Muslim nation welcomed
visitors who followed a religion quite different from their
own.)</P>
<P>   Think back to Jean-Jacques Annaud's "Seven Years in
Tibet" and recall how charming the Dalai Lama was from the
time he was a tyke through his portrayal by the 14-year-old
Bhutanese actor Jamyang Jamtsho Wangchuk.  As a kid he
was absolutely fascinated by his telescope which he'd peer
through constantly though there was not an apartment window
in sight.  He'd bounce up and down while watching movies on
his home projector and radiate delight in life.  Showing
Buddhist-like compassion for all living things was the easiest
task in the world for him since he shed hundreds of watts of
glee at everything he saw of a pre-Chinese derivation.  By
contrast the two-year-old "discovered" by monks as the
fourteenth incarnation of the spirit of Buddha is little more
than a spoiled, self-centered whelp given to bossing his
parents around and insisting that he was "in charge."  To his
credit, though, he did separate two ferocious looking black
ants battling in the Moroccan sands, setting them far enough
apart to live to fight another day.</P>
<P>   What we have is a chronology that begins in 1933, the year
that Hitler became Germany's chancellor, an event as remote
to Tibetans as the emergence of a full moon on Jupiter would
be to a run-of-the-mill New Yorker.  Tested surreptitiously by
monks, the two year old played by Tenzin Yeshi Paichang (if
you're keeping score) "selects" the right objects laid out
before him on a table, thus proving his near-divinity, but by
the time 1944 rolls around, the Dalai Lama is no longer
giggling.  He watches the bombing of Hiroshima with
astonishment and is ultimately challenged when the new
Communist government in Peking (now Beijing) insists that
Tibet surrender its alleged sovereignty and become part of
China.</P>
<P>   The most absurd vision is a conference between the Dalai
Lama and General Mao Tse-tung, the latter played by Robert
Lin who looks as though he had just emerged from Mme
Tussaud's wax museum.  Mao is a heck of a nice guy at first,
so unlike the dictator who ultimately sends his legions to
Lhasa to massacre non-resisting, colorfully costumed
Tibetans.  Knowing that Tibet is doomed as soon as he
notices Mao's shiny, Western shoes, the Lama is faced with a
decision.  Should he agree to the seventeen demands and
turn his people over to these Communists?  Should he remain
in Lhasa and carry out an active resistance?  Or should he
flee just over the border to India and carry on a government-
in-exile there?  Well, now, anyone who knows the difference
between a Lhasa Apso and a Great Dane already remembers
the answer, and the rest is history.  The enlightened
moviegoer will not learn much that is new, save one valuable
piece of information.  Non-violence, for which practicing
Buddhists are famous, does not necessarily mean pacifism. 
Non-violence, as explained in Melissa Mathison's screenplay,
means: cooperate where cooperation is possible, resist when
it is not.</P>
<P>   What the picture does is provide dazzling visuals,
particularly one from the Dalai Lama's nightmares of hundreds
of Buddhist monks lying bloodied in the streets which, as ace
cameraman Roger Deakins draws his camera up and away
resembles nothing less horrible than the gruesome
discoveries made by liberating armies at Auschwitz in 1945. 
"Kundun" has its heart in the right place but emotionally is
oddly distancing and intellectually ordinary.  We might sum up
the 134 minutes as providing us with a "Hello, Dalai, well
hello Dalai...'twould be nice to have you back where you
belong."  Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 134 minutes.  (C)
