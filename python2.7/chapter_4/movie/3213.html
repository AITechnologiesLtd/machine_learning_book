<PRE>                             IMMORTAL BELOVED
                       A film review by Lewis Butler
                        Copyright 1995 Lewis Butler</PRE>
<P>     The movie IMMORTAL BELOVED makes several fatal errors, chief of
which is playing fast and loose with historical accuracy.  How fast and
loose?  About the only things they got right were that Beethoven wrote
the 9th Symphony and that he died.</P>
<P>     It is frustrating to watch this movie if you know anything at all
about Beethoven, and the more you know, the worse it gets.</P>
<P>     Firstly, Beethoven was *not* a ladies man, in fact he was rather
unlucky with women in general, and was often rejected by them.  Because
of this, he tended to form attachments to women who were unreachable
(already married).  In short, he was not Amadeus Mozart, as the first
half of this film would paint him.  He has been linked romantically to
a few women, among them Guilietta Guiucciardi and Teresa von
Brunswick.  No one has ever seriously suggested a romantic link between
Beethoven and the person the movie portrays as the "Immortal Beloved."
As a matter of fact, a man named Maynard Soloman has effectively ended
the debate with his research linking Beethoven and the wife of a good
friend, Antonie Brentano.</P>
<P>     Secondly, Beethoven was quite old when he lost his hearing, in his
late 40's, and it wasn't until 1814, I believe, that he stopped
playing.  The implications in the movie are that Beethoven had stopped
performing by the time he wrote the Eroica (Symphony #3).  He did
remark on his hearing loss in the "Heiligenstadt Testament" written in
1802.  By 1818 Beethoven was unable to hear people in normal
conversation.</P>
<P>     Thirdly, Beethoven's deafness was in no way a secret.  He was
examined by many medical professionals of the day, and he used an
earhorn.</P>
<P>     Fourthly, although it is true that Ludwig and his nephew Karl had
a rather stormy relationship, it is not true in the way it was
depicted in the film.  Yes, Karl did attempt suicide, but he did not
leave his uncle until he had finished helping with the metronome
markings for the Ninth Symphony, and when he left it was with his
uncle's permission (albeit reluctant) to join the army.</P>
<P>     In short, the makers of this film wanted to recapture the essence
of AMADEUS, and in doing so they abandoned the truth.  Beethoven died
in 1827, and he was well-know, popular, and acknowledged as a great
artist.  There are over 100 "Conversation Books" surviving to the
present day, and thousands of pages of musical notes.  In short,
Beethoven's life is not a mystery, we know as much about him as about
Thomas Jefferson or Benjamin Franklin.</P>
<P>     Even with all the historical inaccuracies discarded, the movie
still fails.  Though the performances are good (especially Isabella
Rossellini) the movie fails to to capture the viewers interest.  I
found myself closing my eyes at times and just listening to the music,
knowing there was nothing interesting to see on the screen.  The basic
plot is not only laughable, but predictable.  That is, we know the
woman in black never saw the letter.)  And on top of that, the movie
switches time frames in a helter-skelter manner that leaves the viewer
struggling to reorient.  In short, a poorly scripted and edited
movie.</P>
<P>     In spite of all its flaws, there is some nice art direction and
cinematography work, and the music is wonderfully performed by the
London Symphony Orchestra.</P>
