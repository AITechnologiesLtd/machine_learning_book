<PRE>OUT OF SIGHT
RATING:  7.5 / 10 --> Re-watchable </PRE>
<P>Steven Soderbergh takes a shot at another one of Elmore Leonard's
famous crime novels. He follows the recent footsteps of Quentin
Tarantino with JACKIE BROWN (6.5/10) based on Leonard's "Rum Punch",
Paul Shrader's TOUCH (5/10) and Barry Sonnenfeld's GET SHORTY (7.5/10).
Soderbergh is best known for his award-winning debut film SEX, LIES AND
VIDEOTAPE (Winner of the Palme D'or at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival.)
Since then, he hasn't done anything of great interest.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Extreme bank-robber Foley falls into another caper with partner Buddy,
and a host of other lowlifes after his recent stint in the big house.
During his escapades, he meets US Marshal Sisco, who takes a liking to
this con man, who in turn, falls for the luscious government agent. </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Great crime picture, with interesting performances, unique style and an
intertwining, captivating plot. This movie comes closest to PULP
FICTION (7.5/10) in its style and feel, and definitely delivers on the
appeal elements more successfully than Tarantino's
over-character-developed film JACKIE BROWN. Mind you, this movie does
lack the hipper-than-thou dialogue that was sprinkled throughout PULP
FICTION, but even still, it manages to pull off a great addition to the
crime genre. It's got its thrilling moments, its funny moments, and
even its sexy moments. Like PULP FICTION, the plot goes back and forth
through time, but it is never confusing, and never gets in the way of
the interesting crime-ridden plot line.</P>
<P>The characters are real, or at least feel real, and the developing
relationship between the two leading antagonistic characters is
well-done and believable. Soderbergh's shooting style is slick, and
reminiscent of some of the best '70's exploitation movies, as well as
the soundtrack which comes through like the era left behind, but the
sounds not forgotten. All of the stars are great in their roles, with
exceptional marks to Clooney (who's finally beginning to "act") and
Lopez, who comes through in sexy gangbusters! Also, both stars are
extremely "easy on the eyes", with a tip of the hat to Clooney for
getting in such excellent shape for this flick (my brother noted that
you could bounce a quarter off his well-developed six-pack stomach).
Also, Jennifer Lopez is both sexy and gorgeous. But did I mention that
already? </P>
<P>On the down side, I did find the film to be a little too long on its
running time, but that's about all that I could say on that in regards
to negativity. Add to that, the superior cinematography of the film,
especially during the winter shots in Detroit which were particularly
well-shot, and you've got yourself a great story, told in an original
manner, with two great-looking and interesting leading characters, and
a plot that always keeps you guessing. Top that off with a couple of
cool cameos, and a slick directorial style, and you've got yourself a
nacho-munching cinematic extravaganza for the summer. </P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
Three stars from PULP FICTION also show up in this film.
Michael Keaton's character from JACKIE BROWN makes an appearance in
this film as the same character  he played in the former.
Soderbergh wrote the screenplay to NIGHTWATCH, and also had a hand in
the written form of MIMIC (6.5/10).
Jennifer Lopez was one of the "Fly girls" dancers on the "In Living
Color" TV Show. At the movie wrap party for SELENA, on Oct. 28 1996 in
San Antonio, Jennifer's boyfriend Ojani Noa grabbed a microphone and
proposed to her in the middle of the dance floor, presenting her with a
large marquis-cut diamond ring. She said 'yes'.
Nancy Allen of "Brian DePalma's wife for four years" fame, and star of
DePalma's BLOW OUT (7/10) and DRESSED TO KILL (7/10), plays Midge in
this film.
Screenwriter Scott Frank also wrote the screenplay to GET SHORTY,
another one of Elmore Leonard's novels.</P>
