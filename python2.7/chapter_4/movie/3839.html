<PRE>                                CRIMSON TIDE
                                 [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Gregory Bond
                        Copyright 1995 Gregory Bond
Starring Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington</PRE>
<P>- A great techno-thriller with some huge plot holes.</P>
<P>     Russia has disintegrated into civil war, and the ultra-nationalist
rebel leader has captured a far-east submarine base and missile base.
U.S. nuclear missile submarines are sent off the Russian Pacific coast
as a deterrent.  Then the news comes through that the launch codes on
the Russian missiles have been compromised and the rebels are
threatening to level Japan and North America.  So the order is sent
out, a pre-emptive strike on the rebel-held missile bases.</P>
<P>     Gene Hackman is the Captain of a U.S. Boomer, a good ol' boy
redneck, the last of the learn-it-at-sea captains with combat
experience, and he eats XOs for breakfast.  Denzel Washington is his
new XO (Executive Officer, 2nd in command on the Sub), recruited just
in time for the emergency deployment, Hackman's previous XO having
suffered "appendicitis".  Washington is Academy-trained, a Harvard
graduate, modern, sensitive, has no combat experience and is as close
to a pacifist as you could get in a nuke. So the clash of personalities,
politics and morality is signalled well in advance.</P>
<P>     These tensions are increased a hundredfold when the order to
launch a pre-emptive strike is sent, and explode into boiling point
and armed rebellion when, just as the firing is about to start, another
order that may or may not be a retraction is garbled in reception.
There follows a knife-edge thriller that is basically a two-man play.
Here are two men, dedicated to their task, carrying a burden that might
just be the end of the world, each believing the other is selling their
country into nuclear holocaust.  Passions are high and tensions higher,
faces sweating and jaws clenched.  And we sweat and clench right along
with them.</P>
<P>     After a bit of scene setting, the remainder of the movie is set
inside the boomer.  And a perfect location it is.  Despite being larger
than a WWII-era aircraft carrier, these boats are *cramped*, and the
very tight, intimate locations are used to excellent effect to create
the high-strung tension.  This gives a feeling of tension and
claustrophobia that is unmatched since the seminal submarine movie, DAS
BOOT.  And unlike THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, to which CRIMSON TIDE is
inevitably compared, we in the audience really feel like we're sharing
a very cramped steel coffin, bringer of Armageddon and target of
opportunity.</P>
<P>     The two leads do a very credible job.  I've liked Hackman since he
was Lex Luthor, and if you have fond memories of Superman then you will
have a good handle on his character here.  Washington seems to be
typecast as the sensitive, modern guy, and (to the great credit of the
script), the fact that he is black is just not an issue.  What is at
issue is the whole concept of Nuclear deterrence, and how the chain of
command ultimately depends on people.  The support cast have few lines
and are mainly required to stand around, sweat a lot, and look very,
very stressed.</P>
<P>     The worst part of the film is that it asks for a *huge* suspension
of disbelief, and (despite all they get right), they mess up a lot of
technical details they *really* ought to have got correct.  I suspect
that we are supposed to agree with Washington, consider Hackman to be
the villain, and decide that the whole concept of nuclear war is just
too horrible to contemplate.  But for my money, such moralizing is way
too late by the time the launch order comes, and I was on the Captain's
side right up until the end.  And the ending was a major wimp-out.</P>
<P>     In all, A roller-coaster ride and a great techno-thriller.</P>

<PRE>SPOILERS:</PRE>
<P>Some of the things they got wrong (AFAIK - no doubt the sci.military
pedants will jump all over me where I am wrong):</P>
<P>  >> The opening and closing broadcasts from the French carrier
  Foch - which they pronounced "foash" rather than "fock" - all the
  while showing shots of the USS Enterprise! (The Foch is a
  through-deck carrier with ski-jump; only the U.S. has angled-deck
  carriers.)  It was nice that they at least gave lip service to the
  rest of the world when they called it a French carrier.  And if he
  really was on the flight deck during launch operations, there is
  *no way* you would ever hear a word he said - those jets are
  LOUD!</P>
<P>  >> The ELF is just one of the many radios aboard a boomer - it has
  almost useless bandwith (measured in seconds per character) and is
  used only to transmit a short (3-character?) message telling the
  boomer to come up and talk to a satellite.  There is no way they get
  any sort of orders by ELF.</P>
<P>  >> And no way that they could decrypt half a message, or have the
  message blink in and out like a TV with a busted aerial.  You either
  get a message that decrypts or you don't.  This was just plain
  stupid.</P>
<P>  >> While I have no access to nuke secrets, I can't believe that
  the scenario of withdrawing a launch order within 15 minutes of
  giving it is ever likely, especially to a boomer.  The doctrine is
  basically, once you send a launch order, WW-III is started.  If
  you're not damned sure that you want a war, don't send it!  The
  basic crux on which the whole drama is based is flawed, because the
  system is set up to assume boomers don't get messages reliably.</P>
<P>  >> Given this, I could not believe that Washington's position ("What
  if they've changed their minds?") is reasonable.  They had orders to
  shoot, and they should have launched.  You don't question orders
  like that in *any* branch of the military.</P>
<P>  >> Nor can I believe that this sort of situation isn't covered,
  in very deep and gory detail, in the training the officers receive. </P>
<P>     Not to mention that the conclusion was a terrible cop-out.  Being
Hollywood, there was little chance that the movie ends with the world
being destroyed (even though IMHO a much more powerful ending would be
that the missing message is a launch confirmation, and they wind up
launching then wondering what happens next).  But for the captain to be
made out as the villain and for the XO to be promoted for what is in
effect mutiny is unbelievable.  Being proved right after the fact is no
excuse!  At the very least he would have been decommissioned.</P>
