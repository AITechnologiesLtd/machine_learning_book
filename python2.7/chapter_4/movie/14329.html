<P>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (Dreamworks/Paramount)
Directed by Steven Spielberg
"Saving Private Ryan" opens and closes with the image of a faded,
almost transparent American flag waving in the breeze. It's a vaguely
unnerving sight in a movie that has offers plenty of others even more
disturbing. Director Steven Spielberg's terrifying evocations of Holocaust
atrocities in "Schindler's List" and life in a Japanese prison camp in
"Empire of the Sun" were just a warm-up for the vivid, no-holds-barred
scenes of war in "Ryan."
>From the opening half-hour -- following the preparations for the
D-Day landing of American troops on Omaha Beach -- you can tell this is not
going to be your standard rah-rah-America war picture. These soldiers are
nervous, even nauseous, as they prepare to storm into France. And with good
cause, as it turns out: Almost as soon as the ship's ramp drops into the
water, bullets and carnage begin flying. Never before has a filmmaker so
graphically depicted death on the battlefield, but Spielberg isn't aiming
merely for shock value. He's making a blood-chilling statement about the
human cost of combat, which is brilliantly delivered with the help of
effective hand-held camerawork and outstanding editing by Michael Kahn.
It's to the credit of screenwriter Robert Rodat that this harrowing
beginning proves to be just the set-up of a largely riveting tale with
echoes of "Apocalypse Now." Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is assigned to
track down Private James Ryan, who parachuted into France and went
off-course. It's imperative Ryan be located and brought back home. His three
brothers have all been killed in action, and orders have come down from the
top that Ryan's tour of duty be curtailed. The search for Ryan exposes
Miller and his men to numerous perils and more than a few agonizing moral
questions along the way.
Hanks is perfectly cast as the sincere Miller, whose take-charge
attitude barely conceals his lack of confidence. In one beautiful scene,
Miller's men all notice their commander's hand trembling as he talks about
the next step in their mission, but no one says a word: They all seem to
silently share their hidden terror. Tom Sizemore and Jeremy Davies also cut
memorable figures as soldiers with their own agendas. Only Edward Burns
rings false, partially because the actor seems capable of only one facial
expression, a kind of cynical pout that looks woefully out-of-place.
The other major stumbling block in "Ryan" is the title character
himself, played by Matt Damon, and it's not Damon's fault that Rodat's
script gives Ryan next to no personality and saddles him with a hideous
monologue besides. Still, "Ryan" has been made with so much care, right down
to the lusterless colors that recall tinted photos of WWII battles, that
overlooking its flaws is not difficult.
