<PRE>THE BIG ONE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     Unlike those who think documentaries exist only in the landscape
of serious ideas like the study of famine or repression, Michael Moore
sees the genre in a completely different terrain.  He envisions the art
form as a way to mix theater of the absurd with standup comedy, and he
wraps this all around a serious subject.  In his latest movie, the
maker of the famous ROGER & ME tackles the issue of corporate
downsizing in America.  But don't be taken in, this is just a ruse to
let Moore demonstrate his considerable talent as a comedian.  In one of
the funnier movies this year, THE BIG ONE takes an unabashedly
one-sided position on a subject that it really cares little about and
produces one funny sequence after another.</P>
<P>     The picture, which alternates between Moore's appearances in front
of college audiences and his confrontations with public relations
people at recently downsized firms, starts with a traditional
monologue.  Filmed in 1996 when he was on a book tour to promote his
book "Downsize This! Random Thoughts From An Unarmed American," he
starts by describing the results of his phony letter scam.</P>
<P>     Using official-looking letterhead and checks, he donated $100 to
each of the major presidential candidates, allegedly from groups that
each would most likely find offensive.  Pat Buchanan's check, for
example, was from Abortionists for Buchanan.  Every organization cashed
the checks.  He even got a computer-generated response, he claimed,
from the Perot organization, thanking "Pedophiles of America for Free
Trade" for their generous donation.  The college audience went wild as
he told the story.</P>
<P>     When the Clinton organization found out after the fact that they
had been hoodwinked, presidential press secretary Mike McCurry
complained on television that Moore was an evil influence in politics.
Moore's response in the film is to show pictures of the Lincoln bedroom
and say his problem was that he just didn't donate enough to get any of
the perks.</P>
<P>     This fast-paced documentary veritably pulsates with energy.  Using
music as charged as the film's star and editing it with a deft touch,
the movie never flags even if the last half does begin to get
repetitious.</P>
<P>     Skewering everyone, he develops a thesis that Steve Forbes is
actually an alien from outer space.  In typical Moore fashion, he takes
an outlandish position and uses humor to make his point via
pseudo-scientific analysis.</P>
<P>     The show is at its most awkward when Moore meets people who have
actually been downsized.  He is in his element making low-level human
resource people and company guards squirm, but comforting someone with
real problems does not come naturally to him.  The bottom line is that,
as social commentary, the film is an abysmal failure, but, as comedy,
it delivers.  (It also has the misfortune of being released in a time
when we have the lowest unemployment rate in several decades, so the
tragedy of downsizing is no longer on many newspaper headlines or many
people's minds.)</P>
<P>After ridiculing a long list of companies, where he never gets he
further than the lobby, Moore finally hits potential pay dirt when Phil
Knight, the CEO of Nike, invites him in for an interview.  Although the
jubilant Moore tries his best to make him look foolish, Knight finds
the whole episode hilarious, laughing through almost every minute of
it.</P>
<P>     So where does the title of the movie come from?  In the funniest
segment of all, Moore discusses how we could better market "The United
States of America."  He argues that this name on battleships doesn't
have near the power of something like "Great Britain," whom he calls a
little island with an impressive name.  He proposes we rename our
country, "The Big One," since that's how we see our place in the world
anyway.</P>
<P>     He goes on to propose the music, "We will, we will - rock you," as
a more powerful national anthem, cutting to a pumped-up crowd singing
it while lasers pulsate around them.  And finally, in place of our
coinage's "In God We Trust," he suggests a motto better suited to
current American culture, "In by 10, out by 2."</P>
<P>     THE BIG ONE runs a fast 1:36.  It is rated PG-13 for some strong
language and would be fine for kids around twelve and up.</P>
