                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel

min.</P>
<P>Minor but special film is little known outside Britain, though
its music, The Warsaw Concerto, became an instant radio staple
the world over and is still heard. While a lesser and
derivative score, it made the fame of composer Richard
Addinsell. He was obviously inspired by Rachmaninoff's Second
Piano Concerto, which, in 1945, came into its own in another
British film, David Lean's superb "Brief Encounter."
Addinsell's composition is nicely worked into the film, along
with the Polish national anthem, bits of Beethoven and Chopin.</P>
<P>The movie was a huge hit in beleaguered Britain and high in
the affection of audiences. When it was made and released in
1941, England was being blitzed by the Luftwaffe, Nazi forces
had spread from Norway to Crete, North Africa and Russia.
America had not joined the fray yet. The film was produced by
the British unit of RKO, which financed it. </P>
<P>The main story, told in flashback, deals with the period of
the Nazi invasion of Poland (started September 1, 1939)
through the Battle of Britain (July-September 1940). As Warsaw
is about to fall, pianist Stefan Radetzky (Anton Walbrook),
now with a Polish bomber squadron, is ordered to fly to
Rumania. Interned, he escapes, comes to the USA to concertize
for the Polish Relief Fund. He meets again and marries
journalist Sally Gray, an American with whom he had a
lightning romance in Warsaw. Radetzky gives concerts, then 
joins a fighter squadron of the RAF in England and fights in
the Battle of Britain.</P>
<P>Made under difficult circumstances, the film is, of necessity,
un-fancy, though its early use of actual combat footage is
effectively presented. The very simplicity of the movie, the
absence of Hollywoodian polish, slickness and rah rah
patriotism, its reserve and  immediacy, give it a touching,
semi-documentary directness.</P>
<P>No doubt to boost morale and flesh out the story, there are a
few improbabilities. In one of them, handsome Derrick De
Marney plays a full-of-blarney Irish volunteer in Poland. One
wonders how the short time of the  Polish war (the blitzkrieg)
allowed this.</P>
<P>"Dangerous Moonlight" was not shown in the USA until after the
war. It was somewhat misleadingly rebaptized "Suicide
Squadron," as the original title itself was also  misleadingly
sentimental. In the UK it is the best known work of its
director, Hollywood-trained Irishman Brian Desmond Hurst.</P>
<P>The very interesting star is Vienna-born Adolf Wohlbruck
(later Anton Walbrook) who did well in German and Austrian
films and, after a stint in Hollywood, settled in England.
Distinctive, aristocratic, quietly effective, he became a
major figure in important movies, among them the two that
followed "Dangerous Moonlight" : "The Life and Death of
Colonel Blimp" and "The Red Shoes." In all he made a small
number of films, but these, plus two Max Ophuls French
pictures ("La Ronde" of 1950 and "Lola Montes" of 1955) place
him high among performers.</P>
<P>The main writer of "Dangerous Moonlight" was 25-year old Shaun
Terence Young, then in uniform. Later he became a director of
action movies, including James Bond pictures.  French
cinematographer Georges Perinal was one of Britain's aces of
the camera. Michael Rennie is listed near the bottom of the
credits. The supporting cast also includes the delightful
Cecil Parker who had one of the most distinctive voices in the
history of cinema. (Edwin Jahiel)</P>
