<PRE>"It's a cop thing."
        - Lawrence to Leoni</PRE>
<P>     In the exaggerated universe of big-budget action, comic timing is
everything.  Well-timed jokes between "buddy cops," for example,
provide the buffer against a subject matter that's, frankly, quite
brutal.</P>
<P>     Good comic chemistry also overrides structural flaws.  Formula not
working?  Who cares?  If the audience laughs, it's a hit.  The best
entries in the "buddy cop" genre have practiced this by teaming actors
who can be tough *and* funny.  Nolte and Murphy in 48 HRS.  Gibson and
Glover in LETHAL WEAPON.  Even Schwarzenegger and Belushi in the
underappreciated RED HEAT (1988).</P>
<P>     In BAD BOYS, comic Martin Lawrence and rapper Will Smith team-up
to act tough.  They play wise-cracking Miami narcotic cops who have 72
hours to catch the creeps that burgled their headquarters.  The
high-tech robbers stole a stash of heroin--from the boy's recent
"career bust"- and the force has three days to save face before the
feds move in.</P>
<P>     The formula isn't tweaked *too* far:  Lawrence is the hard-working
family man, while Smith is the single, rich kid with the $100K
Porsche.  The two are best-buddies, though, and their rapport is
*easily* the best thing about this film.  Just watch them breeze
through a sitcom subplot that has each one impersonating the other.</P>
<P>     BAD BOYS marks the return of producers Don Simpson and Jerry
Bruckheimer (BEVERLY HILLS COP).  To direct their super-slick product,
they hired newcomer Michael Bay.  He's from the world of music-video
and it shows.  BAD BOYS has more style than READY TO WEAR, but there's
no punch to the plot.  The director overpowers the narrative with so
much splash and flash that nothing has any impact.  How can you feel a
rush from so much slow-motion?</P>
<P>     The story doesn't make much sense, either.  Though vaguely
believable at first, BAD BOYS spirals toward absurdity until it reaches
a kitchen-sink finale that only a fan of John Woo could love.  When
everyone converges on a airplane hanger--hey, it was shown in the
previews!--it's every stunt double for themselves.</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:  Funny, but too slick to be terribly rousing.  Next up:
              Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson in DIE HARD WITH A
              VENGEANCE.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: B-</PRE>
