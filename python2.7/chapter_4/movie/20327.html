<P>We've all had her before; the teacher that seems to hate us for no
apparent reason, other than the fact that she's jealous of our
future. Such is the title character of "Teaching Mrs. Tingle", a
flawed but fun dark comedy. Mrs. Tingle, played by Helen Mirren, is
kidnapped by three of her students(Katie Holmes, Barry Watson, and
Marisa Coughlan) after she catches them cheating for her final
test. The three students tie her to a bed in her home, and take turns
watching her, while she plays mindgames and tries to make them free
her. Despite a lame script and unfocused direction by "Scream"-scribe
Kevin Williamson, "Teaching Mrs. Tingle" is devilishly entertaining,
and almost becomes the high school satire that "Jawbreaker" tried to
be. The best thing about "Tingle" are the performances of Helen Mirren
and newcomer Marisa Coughlan. Mirren commands the screen and never
loses her edge, while Coughlan always entertains(especially in an
improvised "Exorcist" performance). Katie Holmes and Barry Watson(TV's
"7th Heaven") are merely competent and don't hold the viewer's
attention. I enjoyed Williamson's scripts for "Scream" and "The
Faculty", but a good screenplay here could have made for quite a
surprising film. "Teaching Mrs. Tingle" is his first directing foray,
and he seems to be derivative of anyone with whom he's ever
worked. But the film moves along at a good pace and is a breath of
fresh air from the thankfully forgotten teen horror genre. Teens will
like this film, but wait to rent it on video.</P>
