Susan Granger's review of "ALMOST FAMOUS" (DreamWorks)</PRE>
<P>   Cameron Crowe's first film since "Jerry Maguire" is so
engaging, entertaining and authentic that it's destined to become a
rock-era classic.  Set in 1973, this slightly fictionalized,
semi-autobiographical, coming-of-age story revolves around a
baby-faced 15 year-old (Patrick Fugit) prodigy whose intelligence and
enthusiasm land him an assignment from "Rolling Stone" magazine to
interview Stillwater, an up-and-coming band. With the help of Penny
Lane (Kate Hudson), a bewitching "Band-Aid," he meets the charismatic
lead guitarist (Billy Crudup) who invites him to join the tour, much
to the dismay of his mother (Frances McDormand) who relentlessly
repeats, "Don't do drugs!"  Soon he's part of the inner circle of the
band he idolizes, disregarding the caution of his rock critic mentor
(Philip Seymour Hoffman): "Friendship is the booze they feed you to
make you feel cool." Eventually, of course, the rookie reporter
becomes disillusioned, honest and unmerciful. What's so compelling is
Crowe's infallible casting which doesn't have a single discordant
note. Patrick Fugit embodies innocent bewilderment, revealing one
layer of surprise after another. Billy Crudup is dynamite, a superstar
waiting to happen. Kate Hudson (Goldie Hawn's real-life daughter)
gives a captivating, flamboyant yet hauntingly poignant performance.
Frances McDormand is bracingly funny, playing with perfect
pitch. Philip Seymour Hoffman is mesmerizing, exploding like a land
mine. Finally, Crowe, cinematographer John Toll, art directors Clay
A. Griffith & Clayton Hartley, and costume designer Betsy Heimann
cleverly capture the sense of time and place.  On the Granger Movie
Gauge of 1 to 10, "Almost Famous" is a soaring, spirited 10. I loved
it! I haven't had such a good time at the movies in ages.</P>
