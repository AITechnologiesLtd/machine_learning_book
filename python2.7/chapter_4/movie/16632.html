<P>There is a moment in 'Life is Beautiful' when the clownish Guido tells 
the girl of his dreams what they will do that evening.  He speaks as 
though reminiscing about a story that has become a perfect memory.</P>
<P>As the story progressed, I got the notion that I was watching a favorite 
film, one of the handful that I carry with me everywhere.  Roberto 
Benigni's 'La Vita e Bella' follows closely its early pronouncement in a 
brief voice-over:  it's a fable, perhaps sad and difficult to tell, but 
full of wonder and happiness.</P>
<P>Beginning in Italy in 1939, the story focuses on Guido Orefice (Benigni) 
and his exploits after he leaves the country for the city.  He travels 
with a friend who is a poet as well as an upholsterer.  Guido is a 
waiter;  he's also a solver of riddles, a supreme jokester, an 
aficionado of life.  Soon Guido happens upon Dora (Nicolletta Braschi), 
whom he dubs his "princess."  In a clever leit motif, Guido repeatedly 
surprises Dora in an astonishing variety of places and ways - he's a 
stalker, only lovestruck and hilarious.  After he wins her laughter and 
her heart, times passes and we see the couple with their child, four 
year-old Joshua.  Guido has finally realized his dream of running a 
bookshop, although the politics of the time - the early 'forties now - 
dictates his bookshop shutters be identified with "Jewish Store."  We 
catch glimpses of the happy life lived by Dora and Guido and Joshua, but 
it is not to last.</P>
<P>When Dora returns home one afternoon to find their villa ransacked and 
empty, the story takes a heart-breaking turn.  Guido and Joshua, along 
with Guido's uncle, have been sent to a concentration camp.  It's 
typical of the strength of Guido's love that he tries to protect his son 
from the trauma of the sudden truck- and cattle car-rides by happily 
deluding him.  Enlisting a formidable imagination and his uncle's help, 
Guido constructs an elaborate lie.  The trip is Joshua's birthday gift, 
a game during which one collects points for performing absurd and brutal 
duties.  The Nazis are "mean guys that yell";  Joshua must hide or risk 
being "eliminated" from the game;  the prize for amassing 1000 points is 
a tank, a real-life version of Joshua's favorite toy.  To complicate 
matters, Dora has desperately found her way aboard the train and into 
the camp, secluded from her male family members, of course.  In addition 
to perpetuating the myth of the game, Guido is faced with endeavoring to 
contact Dora, a feat he manages ingeniously.</P>
<P>To assert that the story is punctuated by comic relief would be 
irrelevant, for the film manages to sustain its humorous tone even as 
tragedy seeps into the narrative line.  Benigni's gift to the audience 
is his ability to juggle the subplots, to portray farcical elements 
often within the same sequences as sinister ones.  In one masterful 
tour-de-force, the crafty father pretends he is translating instructions 
from the camp guards to the Italian prisoners.  Eyes shifting endlessly, 
Guido improvises incredible and silly rules;  the result is his son's 
continuing belief in the protective charade.  </P>
<P>Benigni 's Guido is a sweet and hyperactive man, likable long before his 
character is tested by prejudice and internment.  Guido initiates 
several satirical digs at fascism, most memorably when he masquerades as 
a school inspector from Rome, charged with explaining to the school 
children the Italian claims to Aryan superiority.  Benigni is goofy and 
intelligent at once as he mumbles about racist Italian scientists, 
showing his audience of "bambini" his superior belly button and superior 
hip before the real inspector shows up and Guido goes out a window.  
Here Roberto Benigni echoes the performances of the best comedians of 
this century in their send-ups of Hitler's and Mussolini's thugs.</P>
<P>As Joshua, essentially the co-star of the picture, Giorgio Cantarini is 
outstanding.  What's remarkable is that he is so believeable in his 
expressions of extreme emotions.  Though assisted by Benigni's knowing 
direction, the boy's acting never seems fake-y.  One illustration occurs 
when Guido suddenly opens a bin in which Joshua has been hiding.  We see 
the wide-eyed child's look of genuine excitement, almost rowdiness, that 
precedes surprise.</P>
<P>Nicoletta Braschi, as Dora, seems unattainable at first - too beautiful 
and socially connected for Guido the Jewish waiter.  But we witness her 
succumb to Guido's considerable efforts, and the goodness radiates from 
her face.  Her cast of longing and love stuns the viewer in one scene, 
when Guido engineers the playing of their song - an Offenbach opera - so 
that it's audible in the women's barracks.  Her presence is heartening 
during the uncertain times of the film's setting, another goal to keep 
Guido struggling.</P>
<P>I've mentioned motifs already, but they warrant more.  Functioning as 
running jokes, several gags are tied in time and time again, striking 
chords that are magic as well as moving.  The sole criticism I can 
muster is that we need to see more of Dora's family's rejection of 
Guido.  After all, Guido is the interloper who literally carries Dora 
away from her husband-to-be, picking her up with his uncle's "Jewish 
horse"!  Otherwise, the dual themes of humor and menace play about the 
screen brilliantly.</P>
<P>Who will Roberto Benigni be compared with next, after Buster Keaton and 
Charles Chaplin?  That the film has been nominated for an Academy Award 
for Best Picture (and not merely Best Foreign Film), and Benigni for 
Best Actor, Director and Screenwriter (with Vincenzo Cerami) attests to 
its solid stance. (The film is already the recipient of the Best Foreign 
Film award from the Online Film Critics Society.) 'Life is Beautiful' 
takes risks and, unlike a lot of lesser films, earns its tears.  It is a 
must-see for all fans of movies, all devotees to human endurance, and 
all passionate lovers of this beautiful life.</P>
