<P>_Love's_Labour's_Lost_ (PG) ** (out of ****)</P>
<P>In blending the poetry of Shakespearean text with the timeless sounds of
pop standards from the 1930s, Kenneth Branagh--a proven hand at handling
the Bard and an avowed fan of the old MGM musicals--should theoretically
have little problem casting a bewitching romantic spell with
_Love's_Labour's_Lost_.  And that's exactly what he achieves in one
sublime moment where new lovers bid each other a reluctant adieu with a
solemn rendition of "They Can't Take That Away from Me."  The scene is
sweet yet genuinely sad, but not without a knowing sense of humor about
itself (Branagh makes no bones about lifting _Casablanca_ wholesale).  In
short, it's the exact type of natural, persuasive emotion that Branagh is
going after with the whole of this ambitious project--and, more often
than not, ends up falling short of success.</P>
<P>_Love's_Labour's_Lost_ is one of Shakespeare's more obscure works, and
on a basic plot level, it's not difficult to see why.  The King of
Navarre (Alessandro Nivola) and his three closest friends--Berowne
(Branagh), Dumaine (Adrian Lester), and Longaville (Matthew
Lillard)--have made an oath to devote three years entirely to study,
meaning no "vain delights" such as romance.  However, their vow is almost
immediately challenged when the Princess of France (Alicia Silverstone)
and her fetching ladies in waiting--Rosaline (Natascha McElhone), Maria
(Carmen Ejogo), and Katherine (Emily Mortimer)--arrive to hammer out a
financial agreement between the kingdoms.  Complications predictably
ensue as the four men neglect their oath and pursue true love.</P>
<P>Given such a thin story, Branagh's decision to recast the play in the
year 1939 and expand the material with songs of the era is an inspired
one.  And from a technical standpoint, he knows exactly what he's doing. 
Everything looks and sounds right: the overlit, soundstagy sets; the
insanely elaborate choreography; the free-flying camera angles; the
distinct disregard to realism once the music swells.  The cast underwent
a crash course in dance before filming began, and everyone acquits
themselves fairly well, even in the singing department.  There are a
couple of standouts: on the male end, Lester's fancy footwork puts
everyone else's to shame; among the women, McElhone's sultry moves and
song stylings lead the pack.</P>
<P>All the competent staging and performance is of little use, however, if
the very presence and intent of the musical numbers are questionable. 
With relatively few exceptions (such as a simple and charming "The Way
You Look Tonight" crooned by two of the King's tutors, played by
Geraldine McEwan and Richard Briers), Branagh does a clunky job of
meshing the music with the story.  The first few numbers are especially
dreadful in this respect.  For example, a collective "Huh?" could be
sensed in the audience once the King and his buddies abruptly broke into
"I'd Rather Charleston" right before they signed their oath; and for all
its amusing aping of the classically excessive Busby Berkeley style, the
women's pool-set "No Strings (Fancy Free)" simply serves no apparent
purpose other than to have a big Busby Berkeley-style number.</P>
<P>_Love's_Labour's_Lost_ is also meant to be a comedy, and it is in this
area that Branagh stumbles the most.  His apparent direction to all the
cast is to play the material as broadly as possible, hence any real
acting is lost behind some insufferable mugging, particularly in the case
of the designated comic relief characters played by Timothy Spall and
Nathan Lane.  To be fair, though, Branagh's script doesn't offer much
opportunity for many to attempt any real acting.  There are eight core
characters, but only half of them (the King, the Princess, Berowne, and
Rosaline) are allowed to exhibit some personality; the other four are
more like background chorus members.</P>
<P>Also, some given the chance to act drop the ball--or, rather, one.  I'm
referring, of course, to Branagh's most controversial casting choice,
Silverstone.  Any chance the _Clueless_ starlet had to silence critics
starts to creep out the window the instant she opens her mouth, then
comes crashing down below earth during a couple of climactic speeches. 
She tries her best; the problem is that her effort is much too apparent. 
The constantly strained look on her face suggests that she's either (1)
struggling to remember her lines or (2) struggling to remember how to
pronounce them.</P>
<P>Her performance is indicative of the larger problem that plagues
_Love's_Labour's_Lost_.  The film's heart is definitely in the right
place, intending to show how easy and natural it is to be consumed by the
magic of love.  Unfortunately, Branagh's well-meaning but mechanical
execution makes falling in love seem like an uncommonly laborious task.</P>
