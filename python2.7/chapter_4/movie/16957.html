<P>When you decide you don't like a film while you are still watching it, 
it is hard to turn back.</P>
<P>Sure, I like when films take quirky and unexpected turns as much as the 
next moviegoer.  But when the final third of 'Rushmore' commenced its 
pointless darkness - a futile evocation of the whimsicality of revenge 
and friendship - I had nearly made up my mind that all the press 
received by the film was wrong-headed.  The final minutes were more to 
my liking, but the film was still marred for me.</P>
<P>'Rushmore' opens with a fantasy in which the main character, Max Fischer 
(Jason Schwartzman), imagines himself solving a math problem that would 
baffle Will Hunting.  His classmates in the private academy are 
ecstatic, and Max is a hero.  Of course this scene proves ironic, as we 
soon see that Max is one of the worst students on campus.  Having 
attended Rushmore since his primary grades, Max has immersed himself in 
extra-curriculars - he is either an officer or the founder of 
organizations involving beekeeping, fencing, lacrosse, French, 
wrestling, stamp and coin collecting, and many others.  Most 
impressively, Max writes and stages his own plays.  In fact, one of the 
film's strengths is these productions:  their exaggerated grittiness 
becomes a tour-de-force, and we cannot help but admire and like their 
creator.  Behind the set of Max's 'Serpico' a small-gauge elevated train 
runs through a miniature city more detailed than David Letterman's set.  
Aside from Max's fantasies and quirky imagination, we also see inventive 
narrative techniques, such as a theater curtain opening and closing, the 
months of the story's span flashing across the velvet folds.  So there 
are several charming and eccentric elements that endear the story to the 
viewer.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Max's behavior itself ends up over-the-top.</P>
<P>After 15 year-old Max meets and falls in love with a Rushmore first 
grade teacher (Rosemary Cross, played by Olivia Williams), he begins a 
pattern of behavior that is at first worshipping - pouring her lemonade 
as she grades papers in the library - and finally obsessive.  Practiced 
in the pathology of lying, Max deceives and manipulates countless 
friends;  because his actions become so despicable, we are perhaps 
unwilling to forgive him wholly.  Further, would the victims of such a 
young skunk realistically not only accept apologies but befriend Max 
again? Here's the rub.</P>
<P>Bill Murray acts very well in the film.  As Herman Blume, a wealthy 
alumnus of Rushmore, Murray tempers his goofy comic expression with a 
cynical ennui that fits just right with his part.  Max compares very 
favorably to Blume's twin hooligan sons, and Blume likes Max's 
sycophantic ambition so well that he chucks Max a job offer.  One of 
Murray's strong suits is his sudden bursts of silliness, sprinting away 
across a playground or darting into a children's basketball game to 
block a shot.  Later begins one of the major conflicts, the subplot 
encompassing the rivalry between Max and Herman, after Herman too falls 
in love with Miss Cross.  Again Murray is properly deadpan, the camera 
lingering on his jaded but hilarious expression just long enough.  Note 
his matching shirts and neckties, a wink at classy tackiness!</P>
<P>Jason Schwartzman does a fine job as well.  His resemblance to a very 
young Dustin Hoffman is inevitable, especially his head-on approach to 
other characters.  It's a shame that the screenplay by -------and 
director Wes Anderson does in the credibility of his character.  The 
writing also short changes Olivia Williams' character:  Miss Cross is 
pretty, but aside from missing a dead husband and reading to her 
students, she never does anything that develops her character.  We fail 
to witness even a montage of moments that bond her to either male 
character trying to win her attention and love.</P>
<P>Mason Gamble as Dirk Calloway, Max's protégé at Rushmore, and --------- 
as Margaret Yang, Max's quasi-girlfriend and gun moll in one of his 
plays, both hand in wonderful performances.  Most of their motivations 
seem right, and their acting shows a nice transparency.</P>
<P>The time of 'Rushmore' - 89 minutes - is right.  My wife looked at her 
watch even during this duration.  I am a man who like to fall in love 
with a movie, and with 'Rushmore" I was just able to like its 
characters.  Instead of watching a thoroughly engaging story, what I saw 
was a dark and underdeveloped character study.</P>
