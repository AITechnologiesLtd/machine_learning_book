Dutton, Patricia Neal, Ned Beatty, Courtney B. Vance, Donald Moffat, Lyle

written by Anne Rapp
directed by Robert Altman</P>
<P>Robert Altman has earned his reputation as one of America's most
distinguished filmmakers. He has made war films(MASH), historical
dramas(VINCENT & THEO) and legal thrillers(THE GINGERBREAD MAN). But
this time around, he has directed COOKIE'S FORTUNE, a hilarious and
quirky dark comedy that opened 1999's Sundance Film Festival. First
time writer Anne Rapp wrote this kinda-sorta murder mystery that
slightly echoes the Coen brothers' FARGO and David Dobkin's CLAY
PIGEONS. What is kind of ironic about COOKIE'S FORTUNE is that 15
minutes into the movie, we know who commited the murder and how, and
during the course of the film we are watching the citizens of a small
town called Holly Springs try to figure out what it going on.</P>
<P>Willis Richland(Charles Dutton) has noticed that Cookie(Patricia
Neal), an old lady whom he cares for, has started acting a trifle
odd. One day, when he goes out to run a few errands, Cookie commits
suicide to finally reunite with her dead husband.  Unfortunately, the
first to arrive at her home is Camille(Glenn Close), a quirky relative
who has come to fetch a salad bowl. She notices that Cookie isn't
answering her, so she goes upstairs to find Cookie dead, the gun in
her hand. Camille's dimwitted sister, Cora, wanders inside and also
sees what has happened. "Cookie did not commit suicide," Camille
assures her. "Only crazy folks commit suicide." Camille, for reasons
unknown to anyone except for her, wants to prove that her family isn't
crazy, so she tries to pass off Cookie's suicide as a murder. She goes
through all the steps trying to make it seem like a murder, and then
calls the cops. Meanwhile, Cora's delinquent daughter, Emma(Liv
Tyler), is back in town. When the police suspect Willis of commiting
the crime, and lock him up, she decides to become her
cellmate. Infact, the jail cell is basically an open room where the
cops come in and play Scrabble and talk about fishing with the
criminals. One of the cops is Jason, a very dumb young man who is in
love with Emma. Jason is excited to be coping with the town's first
real crime, and Camille is trying to cover it up right in front of
him.</P>
<P>COOKIE'S FORTUNE isn't one of Altman's more important films, but it is
still a cut above most dark comedies. Unlike many directors, Altman
isn't trying to show off any derivative new style. He just wants the
viewer to see the characters in their real life form, which makes the
film all the more convincing. I'm surprised to see that the film
recieved somewhat lukewarm reception at Sundance. Perhaps the viewers
were hoping for something different. But I, for one, loved this
entertaining gem. Infact I may have even enjoyed it better than
Altman's last outing, the John Grisham's scripted THE GINGERBREAD MAN,
which was also a very good picture. COOKIE'S FORTUNE is a breath of
fresh air from other derivative movies made by twentysomething film
students.  It shows patient, developed filmmaking from a truly
knowledgable filmmaker.  COOKIE'S FORTUNE is one of the new year's
smartest comedies.</P>
