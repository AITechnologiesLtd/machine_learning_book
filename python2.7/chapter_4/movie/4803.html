<P>      Unforgettable-- not.  Cross THE FUGITIVE with STRANGE DAYS and you
get Ray Liotta as a Seattle medical examiner acquitted of killing his
wife and now trying to catch the Real Killer by re-experiencing her
memories.  (Through an injection of her preserved cerebrospinal fluid,
among other things.) A collection of top talent both before and behind
the camera-- including Linda Fiorentino in the non-bitch role of a
biochemist-- is impressive, but Bill Geddie's script is too densely
plotted to be of use to anyone.  Director John Dahl (THE LAST SEDUCTION,
RED ROCK WEST) is so busy connecting the dots that he fails to remember
the bare necessities, such as natural tension or character development.
The last thirty minutes are the worst:  Dahl playing catch-up with a
series of imbedded flashbacks, not realizing that his film ceased to be
interesting almost an hour ago.  What a waste.  </P>
