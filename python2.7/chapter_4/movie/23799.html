<P>I went in to see PRICE OF GLORY with a slight sense of dread: after 
being upset for so long about the havoc Jon Seda's character Falsone 
wreaked on TV's HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET (RIP), I was sure that his 
character here would just overwhelm everyone else, leaving me with a bad 
Seda taste in my mouth once again.   Boy, was I wrong--in more ways than 
one. </P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Arizona-based Arturo Ortega (Jimmy Smits) coulda been a contenda--until 
his opponent opened up a can of whupass on him in a 1977 boxing match.  </P>
<P>13 years later, Arturo starts to live out his dream of boxing glory 
through his young sons Sonny and Jimmy, both of whom he trains in a 
Mariposa, Arizona gym.  Sonny is the more skilled of the two 
brothers--something that Arturo never lets Jimmy forget--but when Sonny 
and Jimmy do relatively badly at a Silver Gloves tournament, their 
youngest brother Johnny surprises the whole Ortega crew by announcing 
that he's ready to give up street football to become a boxer, saying 
"them two stunk!"</P>
<P>10 years later...17-year-old Johnny (Ernesto Hernandez) intensely 
prepares for his Golden Gloves tournament, and catches the eye of boxing 
scout Pepe (Paul Rodriguez) and promoter Nick Everson (Ron Perlman); 
Everson approaches Arturo with the offer to "relieve" him of his 
managing duties for Sonny (Jon Seda) and Jimmy (Clifton Collins, Jr.), 
"throwing in" Johnny for good measure.  But Arturo has his eyes on the 
prize--the glory days he sees ahead.  The question is, is it glory for 
them--or for him?</P>
<P>The Upshot:
There's a point in this movie where it went from being enjoyable in its 
look at family dynamics from a Latino point of view that is usually not 
seen in mainstream Hollywood, to being a candidate for TV 
Movie-Of-The-Week.  I can't quite pinpoint where PRICE OF GLORY lost its 
slight edge, but it's there.  Maybe I blinked, and it was gone.  Or 
maybe I was just so thrilled to see so many Mexican-Americans portrayed 
on the Silver Screen without the stereotypically scripted behavior we've 
come to expect, that I didn't notice the lack of depth all along.  And 
that, not my assumption of what Seda would be like, is what left me 
wanting more from this movie than it was prepared to deliver.</P>
<P>Early on, though, there were winning performances; Seda, in particular, 
surprised me with his relatively muted turn as Sonny (if you've ever 
watched him chewing the scenery in "Homicide", you'll know why I was 
surprised).  His acting here was aided, no doubt, by the fact that he 
once was a Golden Gloves boxer himself; he definitely looked comfortable 
on the body bag.  Equally good in the early stages was Clifton Collins 
as the put-upon Jimmy, and Maria del Mar as Arturo's wife Rita; I 
cheered when seeing the interaction between Arturo and his wife, as they 
looked genuinely attracted to each other, and dedicated (in different 
ways) to their sons.  And in his feature film debut, Ernesto Hernandez's 
Johnny Ortega didn't quite give an Oscar-worthy performance, but he had 
his Intense Scowl look down-pat.</P>
<P>On the other side of the ring, Ron Perlman was never convincing as a 
boxing promoter; about the only thing he could've promoted was a bout of 
sleep.  I never did figure out what purpose Danielle Camastra's 
character Mariella served; a throwaway role if I ever saw one, her 
introduction to Arturo as Sonny's girlfriend served its purpose  
sufficiently enough, without the need to have her stand around looking 
Sad in the background, taking up frames of film.  And maybe it was Just 
Me, but Louis Mandylor just did not look like he belonged in a boxing 
ring, though his turn as the rather mean-spirited Davey Lane did seem to 
serve as a needed bit of conflict and tension that was missing from most 
of the movie.  After all, what's a title bout without someone talking 
trash?</P>
<P>Above all, Jimmy Smits gives a winning performance as patriarch Arturo 
Ortega.  At times funny (his Thanksgiving prayer and insistence on 
getting a rad green Cadillac convertible, made me laugh out loud), and 
at other times pensive and sad, Smits showed a side of his acting 
abilities that wasn't allowed to come to the fore nearly enough during 
his NYPD-BLUE days.  </P>
<P>So why did PRICE OF GLORY fall so flat?  Beats me; maybe it developed 
wobbly knees from going a round or two too long, and collapsed under the 
weight of Delivering A Message.  The editor could have easily excised a 
half-hour or so with no ill-effects, giving it a tighter focus and less 
repetition on the theme.  Certainly, they could've lost the irritating 
Paul Rodriguez in a pile of film in the trash dump; he used up his 15 
Minutes a lifetime ago.</P>
<P>In the end, there just didn't seem enough there to rally around; by the 
time the Obligatory Title Match came around, enough of the outcome had 
been telegraphed beforehand to make the results all but assured, and 
frankly, by that point, The Point had already been made.  And though the 
movie seemed authentic on the boxing front, from both the writer's 
standpoint as well as the cinematographer's great shots of the 
pugilistic action--one in particular, with young Arturo hitting the 
canvas, tore right through me, it seemed just that real--the spirit 
seemed to drain out of the movie as it rolled on.  What had started out 
as a fun flick, with great Latin sounds and interesting characters, 
wound up as worthy of being a TV Afternoon Special.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line: 
I wanted to give this one a higher rating, but story-wise, it's more 
suited to a cable TV movie than a feature film release.  Still, Smits 
shows he's got the nalgas to carry a motion picture on his own - if 
Hollywood opens the door for him.  Hmmm...I wonder if I should hold my 
breath...</P>
<P>PRICE OF GLORY (rating: yellowlight): 
More a glancing blow than a knockout, it still gets props for what it 
*didn't* show: stereotypical Latinos, Hollywood-style.  That's worth at 
least an extra point or two on my scorecard.</P>
