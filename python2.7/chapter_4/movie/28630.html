<PRE>"Scary Movie 2"</PRE>
<P>Last year, Keenen Ivory Wayans and his brothers Marlon and Shawn promised
us "No sequel!" as part of the advert blurb for their enormously popular
"Scary Movie." But, a domestic take of $200 million is apparently enough to
make them to go back on their word and the result is "Scary Movie 2."</P>
<P>I wish the Wayans had kept their pledge, after spending an interminable 85
minutes suffering through "Scary Movie 2." If you are a fan of urine, feces
and semen jokes, you will probably like this bomb. You get ample, even
copious, amounts of each. For more discerning filmgoers (i.e. anyone over
the mental age of 12), be warned, this second installment to the new Wayans
franchise lacks the rapid-fire humor of the original. The first flick made
fun of the modern horror film genre, like "Airplane!" with one gag after
another coming at you. If you didn't like one joke, you just had a few
seconds to wait for the next. Overall, they hit a lot more than they
missed.</P>
<P>With "Scary Movie 2" the Wayans brothers decided to forgo the
one-gag-after-another formula and, instead, use a plot-driven story that is
mainly a parody of the recent mediocre horror movie, "The Haunting." Sure,
there are a whole bunch of other movies and pop culture references
throughout - "The Exorcist," "The Amityville Horror," "Dracula," "Dirty
Harry," "Mission Impossible 2," "Charlie's Angels," "Hannibal" and those
noisy basketball commercials all get their due. The problem with "Scary
Movie 2" is it spoofs a movie that, if you saw the original "The Haunting,"
is really a parody of that classic horror flick. You would think that the
seven credited writers could come up with a better idea.</P>
<P>Coupling the lame plot line of "The Haunting" with buckets of bodily fluids
makes this venture very unfunny, indeed. The opening "Exorcist" parody,
before the credits, turns out to be the funniest part of "Scary Movie 2,"
thanks to an outrageous twist on the Father Merrin character by James
Woods. His unholy holy man made me feel that we might be in for a
continuation of the first flick. Then the credits roll and we get the
aforementioned buckets. All the original characters are here, but they are
simply going through the motions. The filmmakers had something going the
first time around, but they lost it here. Even a foul-mouthed parrot named
Polly isn't funny, and I love foul-mouthed birds.</P>
<P>Techs are probably OK. I was too numbed by the non-humor of "Scary Movie 2"
to notice. You're better off renting the original and getting yourself a
pizza with what you'll save by not going to see "Scary Movie 2." They said,
the first time, "no sequel." I wish they kept their promise. I give it a D.</P>
