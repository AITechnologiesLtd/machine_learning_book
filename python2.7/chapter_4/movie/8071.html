<PRE>AURORA: OPERATION INTERCEPT 1995
 A film review by Timothy Voon
Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Directed by Paul Levine
Cast Bruce Payne (I), Natasha Andreichenko, Lance Henriksen, John
Stockwell, Michael Champion, Dennis Christopher, Corbin Bernsen
Written by Paul Levine</P>
<P>This movie should have been wrapped up in fifteen minutes, thus saving
viewers form witnessing a shameful mockery of their intelligence.</P>
<P>Captain Pruett (Payne) is a pilot of one of the U.S. top secret air
craft code named ‘Aurora'. He is ordered to destroy a terrorist base in
the middle-east, which contains a device which is able to scramble the
flight controls of any domestic or military plane. The terrorists are
threatening to down a domestic plane every four hours, unless their
demands are met. He disobeys his orders because another U.S. pilot is
currently held hostage in the base.</P>
<P>I could not understand how the military could have allowed a man as
indecisive and subversive as Pruett, to fly one of their most deadly
planes. I can understand his dilemma of saving the life of one man,
whilst risking the lives of thousands; but from what I understand of the
military, obeying orders comes before one's personal feelings.</P>
<P>His disobedience results in his capture; the deaths of two pilots,
including the man whom he risked his mission for; the endangered lives
of those on domestic flights, and the use of his captured plane by the
terrorists to blow up the White House.</P>
<P>Woe to this man, if only he had obeyed his orders. Although he rectifies
his error, his careless disobedience goes unpunished.</P>
<P>The writer and director Levine, really needs to rethink where this plot
is coming from. The audience will not simply accept this movie on the
basis of some impressive plane dog fights.</P>
<P>Comment: Painfully stupid and unsatisfying.</P>
