<P>   Who are the world's bad guys?  Are they the folks from the
industrialized world who rape and plunder the weaker
nations?  Are they the world's white guys who exploit those of
color?  The down-and-out guerrillas who commit atrocities
against seemingly innocent villagers?  The rich?  The poor? 
The liberals?  The conservatives?  Inspired by stories from
the novelist Francisco Goldman, who wrote of an uncle who
administered medicine to poor communities in Guatemala,
John Sayles has written, directed and edited a road movie of
mythic proportions to expound on this question.  His answer
to the riddle?  The title gives it all away.  Men with guns are
the abhorrent of the earth.  No matter whether you're white or
black, rich or poor, western or developing: if you've got the
weaponry, you'll use it, and the power which you get from
superior military might will corrupt you.  You will use the
authority of the gun to rape, plunder, and decide arbitrarily
who is guilty and deserving of punishment.</P>
<P>   "Men with Guns" will not enjoy the commercial power that a
Costa-Gavras film like "Z" possessed, largely because it is
almost totally in Spanish and Indian dialects (with subtitles)
and because the editing--which Sayles insists on doing
himself rather than hiring a professional--is pedestrian.  Nor
does "Men With Guns" have the complexity of his world-class
movie, "Lone Star,"  or a single name recognizable (save
Mandy Patinkin) by a potentially large market.  Yet there is
not a single dull moment in the picture even as it trudges
along from one destination to another, each stop on the road
adding to the political wisdom of its central character.</P>
<P>   The movie focuses on an elderly white doctor of liberal
persuasion living in a fictitious Latin American country. 
Filmed entirely in Mexico, Sayles fixes his camera on Dr.
Fuentes (Federico Luppi), who had recently lost his wife, is on
the verge of retirement, and is determined to find out first-
hand whether the legacy he has willed to the world is
successful.  Having trained a group of bright young doctors to
go barefoot--so to speak--into the poor Indian villages of his
country to bring them the medicine they so desperately need
but cannot afford, he sets out from his well-appointed
suburban home to track his students down.  Though his now-
ailing heart is in the right place, Humberto Fuentes is
politically naive, refusing to believe that outside the big cities
looms disastrous instability.  He is to discover first-hand that
his is not the best of all possible worlds.  His first adventure
graphically symbolizes the disillusionment he will face on his
political, emotional, moral and, indeed, metaphoric journey, as
he discovers his brightest student Bravo (Roverto Sosa)
operating a drug market in a slum neighborhood on the
outskirts of the city.  </P>
<P>   Though police officers assure him that there are no
guerrillas in the areas under their command, they warn him to
return to the capital, but their advice simply drives Fuentes on
as he barrels into the mountain with his rugged vehicle
picking up a hodgepodge of unusual, deeply flawed people. 
These include an abandoned, streetwise boy, Conejo (Dan
Rivera Gonzalez), an army deserted Domingo (Damian
Delgado) who robs him and later begs him to remove a bullet
from his rib, a defrocked priest (Damian Alcazar), and a
comical couple of clueless American tourists played by Mandy
Patinkin and Kathryn Grody.</P>
<P>   If the movie were made by Costa-Gavras, the doctor would
conclude that the army, backed up by a right-wing
government, is the source of all evil.  But Sayles spreads the
guilt around.  True, the members of the armed forces have
been killing doctors and other intellectuals, assuming that
anyone helping the poor Indians must be subversive.  But the
guerrillas have been terrorizing the local populations as well,
executing those whom they believe are assisting the army. 
The Indians, ignorant and superstitious, for the most part
refuse to talk to the white stranger.</P>
<P>   Sayles seems to say that despite the doctor's excellent
intentions he has spent his life in deliberate ignorance, so
dedicated to his comfortable, bourgeois lifestyle that he
refuses to believe that the people of his country could be
murderers and rapists.  In that regard, Sayles shares the
stage with playwright Bertolt Brecht, who naively believed that
his plays could awaken his middle-class audience to the
wickedness to which they have closed their eyes and ears.  </P>
<P>   Sayles reaches far and wide.  We leave the film aware that
he is not talking about any specific country: that Latin
American dictatorships are surely not afflicted with the very
worst forms of rule.  In one case, for example, he has the
defrocked priest tell an obviously autobiographical story of
how guerrillas ordered the people of a village to execute six
of their own people, failing which the terrorists would kill every
member of the community.  This can be taken as a reference
to the practice in Nazi concentration camps in which capos
were occasionally asked to make the selections themselves of
those who should be sent immediately to their deaths lest
entire groups be wiped out by the SS themselves.  On the
broadest scale, the film makes its point loud and clear that
those with the superior firepower will inflict their will by force
on those with more modest defenses, and have done so time
and again throughout the centuries.</P>
<P>   The MTV crowd is not Sayles's targeted audience for this
movie.  Despite the theme that life's tragedies are circular,
that they endure time and again whether or not we "know"
about them, the movie will win no prizes for visual
pyrodynamics but seems a throwback to a time that movie-
makers were content to tell solid, linear narratives.  That said,
the right audience will find much that is appealing in the film,
not the least attribute being the sincere, earthy acting of the
entire cast of relative unknowns.  Rated R.  Running Time:
126 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten</P>
