<PRE>October Sky
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1999 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4) I liked OCTOBER SKY and was moved by it in all the right
ways. But it's a movie that doesn't stand up to review very well.
Two-dimensional characters and a trite story (even though it's based on
a true story) almost force me to give it a lower rating than my heart
says it deserves.</P>
<P>While the miners of the town descend into the coal mines, high schooler
Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal) looks up to the stars to try to see
Sputnik. His first glimpse of the orbiter sets his resolve: someday he
will build rockets and satellites too.</P>
<P>Homer knows just enough about rocketry to know that he can't pursue it
alone. Since his coal-mining hometown has a definite lack of rocket
scientists to serve as mentors, he decides to sacrifice his social life
to befriend Quentin (Chris Owen), the redheaded nerd. Two other friends
of Homer's join them, rounding out their foursome. With Quentin's smarts
and Homer's enthusiasm, they should be able to launch a rocket in no
time.</P>
<P>The rocket boys master the basics pretty quickly, and they even manage a
meager launch or two. But each accomplishment presents new challenges.
The next rocket has to be bigger, fly farther, or have more control.
They boys hit several snags, and their solutions always delight. To
solve one problem, Quentin bones up on volatile chemistry until
inspiration strikes. Another problem is solved by befriending some of
the miners who have access to metal lathes.</P>
<P>In the meantime, a subplot involving Homer's differences with his father
(Chris Cooper) adds some too-harsh conflict to the film. Homer's father
is completely overbearing and totally inflexible. He's dead-set against
Homer's dreams of rockets. Based on a true story or not, the sharp
antagonism was too strong for this movie.</P>
<P>In fact, his father was so caricatured (blame the script, not the actor)
that I was reminded of a Monty Python sketch. Graham Chapman plays a
stern, hard-working, blue-collar poet. This poet refuses to stand by
while his mamby-pamby son throws away his life to follow his dream of
becoming a coal miner. It's a funny reversal of the cliché that this
movie perpetuates.</P>
<P>In spite of Homer's dad, the boys finally get a few really good rockets
launched. But OCTOBER SKY sticks to the formula and takes their dreams
away, once and for all. A forest fire spread from where one of their
rockets landed, and the boys are arrested. All seems lost, so Homer
gives up rocketry and high school to get an early start on coal mining.</P>
<P>The film actually takes us down into a coal mine (surely it was a set).
I mention it because it is something I have NEVER seen in a movie
before. From HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY in 1941 to BRASSED OFF two years
ago, there have been lots of movies about coal miners. But never have I
actually seen INSIDE one of the mines, -- seen how cramped, black, and
precarious the mine itself feels. October Sky gets bonus points for
these scenes.</P>
<P>But if that were the end of the story, we wouldn't be watching it on a
big screen, would we? In fact, the boys find a way to clear their names.
They calculate the flight time of their rocket, do a little geometry,
and track down the rocket that was alleged to have started the fire.
They found it in a stream. (Strictly speaking, they never could have
found their rocket from the information they had in the movie. They knew
flight time and direction, but not the angle at which the rocket was
launched. Without that, there's no way to measure distance.)</P>
<P>Like I said, the movie doesn't review well. The plot is trite, the
conflict feels forced, and even the math doesn't work out perfectly.</P>
<P>But Homer's story was moving, and all the more so because his goal was
scientific achievement. In movies with this success-story plot, the hero
often wants to become a great athlete or a famous performer. Homer's
dream was more unusual and somehow less selfish.</P>
<P>Ultimately, the emotion of the story simply worked for me, and I'll
never be able to put my finger on just why. </P>
