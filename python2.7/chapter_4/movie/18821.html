<P>The Happy Bastard's Quick Movie Review</P>
<PRE>AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME</PRE>
<P>"I'm dead sexy!" yells an enormously large Scottish man, hellbent on
catching Dr. Evil's notoriously evil (and midget-like) twin Mini-Me for
a quick snack.  "Get in my belly!!" he bellows, and Mini-Me quickly
scampers back to Dr. Evil, who's hesitant on letting the guy (Fat
Bastard is his name) use his crapper.</P>
<P>It's moments like this absolutely ridiculous one that make Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me just as much a fun romp as the original.
Mike Myers shows he hasn't lost any creativity, and, through lots of
comic timing, comes up a winner with a hilarious, if slightly
overwrought, sequel.</P>
<P>Basically, the story begins roughly where the first one left off.  The
honeymoon ends quickly for Austin and his new bride Vanessa (Elizabeth
Hurley in a funny cameo), and soon Austin is thwarted by the efforts of
his nemesis Dr. Evil, who's making it personal- this time, he's after
Austin's "life force", his mojo.</P>
<P>That leads Austin to travel back to 1969 to try and retrieve his mojo,
before Dr. Evil gets any bright ideas and uses it himself.  (Of course,
a scene where he gets a taste of the mojo is funny as hell.)  There,
Austin teams up with Felicity Shagwell (a very sexy Heather Graham),
who's just as horny as he is...er, was.  Along the way, we're introduced
to many characters, including the aforementioned Fat Bastard and
Mini-Me, as well as a younger Number Two (Rob Lowe), the ill-fated
Mustafa (Will Ferrell), and Dr. Evil's sarcastic son Scott (Seth Green).</P>
<P>Sure, the movie has some slight dull spots, and I think the gags
involving product placement were a slight bit overrun (Fat Bastard's
take on the Chili's song was pretty funny, though), but a lot of the
movie has inspiration, something a sequel usually lacks.  There's some
great new gags here, a gaggle of cool cameos (from Tim Robbins to Woody
Harrelson to...you guessed it...Jerry Springer), and, of course, more
"evil" than you can shake a stick at.  It's all in fun, and the overall
product is very shagadelic.</P>
<PRE>RATING: 8 (out of 10)</PRE>
