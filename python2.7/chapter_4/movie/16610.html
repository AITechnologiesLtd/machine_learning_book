<PRE>Hurlyburly (1998)</PRE>
<P>This is a buddy movie, pure and simple. It's different from the
usual buddy flick in that it is based on a play (by David Rabe)
and therefore has a more sophisticated theme and snappier dialog
than, say, Lethal Weapon. Still, it's all about a bunch of guys
who would rather not deal with women too seriously.</P>
<P>Eddie is a talent agent in Hollywood. He's very tightly wound and
does way too many drugs as well, which makes him a pain in the
ass to be around. He talks all the time, mostly to his roommates,
Mickey and Phil, both of whom have been thrown out of the house
by their wives. Mickey works with Eddie in some capacity, while
Phil is a low level actor typecast as the quiet muscular type.
They're opposites in many ways--Mickey is together, smart,
urbane, Phil is an excon and a goon. All of them are very
ambivalent about women (while remaining ardently straight, of
course) and all of them are extraordinarily verbal, even the
inarticulate Phil, unfortunately.</P>
<P>These three fellows, along with buddy Artie who drops by a lot,
would spend all of their time talking and blowing weed if it
weren't for the women that move in and out of their sad little
frat-house existence. There is Darlene, who is nominally Eddie's
girl friend, though Mickey has had a fling with her. Phil is
married and desperately wants to get back with his wife while
seeming to want to strangle her at the same time. There is a
performance artist-cum-stripper who likes to hang around. And
there is a jailbait street kid that seems to like casual sex very
much (these fellows show  bad judgement as a matter of course).</P>
<P>That's the whole movie. A few important things happen, but I
shouldn't give them away. By the end, things have changed and
there is an epiphany and even a little redemption. Mostly,
Hurlyburly is about the characters.</P>
<P>The movie has the star power for a character study. Sean Penn
plays Eddie as someone who is trying so hard to understand the
meaning of everything going on around him and failing miserably
because he is hung up on the words. He thinks that we create
meaning by putting it all into words, by creating verbal symbols,
yet he is too concrete, too literal minded, and as a result he
gets hung up on semantics and definitions. (He actually has an
argument with Darlene over whether she is indifferent or just
doesn't care). Penn takes chances with Eddie, portraying him as a
self-abused loser with barely a shred of self-respect; in one key
scene Eddie is left literally holding his tool.</P>
<P>Kevin Spacey is perfect for the self-contained and knowing
Mickey, unflappable, in control and always ready to joust with
Eddy. Of course, if Mickey is really all that together, you
wonder why his wife threw him out to live with Eddy. He's built a
wall of sarcasm around himself. Ordinarily, you'd think that this
was all defense, that there was a vulnerable and scared Mickey
behind the Flip Mickey. I don't believe so--I think there's
nothing there, or else he's Flip Mickey alll the way down to his
core.</P>
<P>The best performance is Chaz Palminteri as the pathetic thug
Phil. He's trying to figure out what's going on around him and he
puts it all into words, but nothing comes out that makes any
sense. Watching Phil is like watching Zippy the Pinhead. In spite
of the funny sounds that come out of his mouth, he's a character
of extreme menace who might go off at any minute. Whenever he's
in a scene, you're afraid he might kill somebody.</P>
<P>The women in the film are played by Robin Wright Penn, Anna
Paquin and Meg Ryan, each of whom does a fine job in three very
different roles. I don't want to slight their work here, but the
movie is clearly about the boys; these fine actresses have enough
to do but their characters are clearly satellites. The verbal and
inarticulate Eddy is really in love with the verbal and
inarticulate Phil. That's the emotional heart of Hurlyburly.</P>
<P>In the end, Phil tries to make himself a better person and fails.
Eddie learns a little bit more about what life is really about.
Mickey is still Mickey.</P>
<P>Hurlyburly is a good character movie and it's really a lot of fun
to watch all these stars do their work. Still, the movie is
relatively plotless and the movement at the end is all small and
relative. Hurlyburly betrays its theatrical roots. It's very
intellectual, very talky, and not much happens. The resolution at
the end is small and you have to think about it. There's nothing
wrong with that, as far as I'm concerned, but I've seen a lot of
this sort of thing over the last few years. In a way, Hurlyburly
seems like a remake of Glengary Glen Ross, and I'm not sure how
many of those we need. I'd recommend Hurlyburly highly to anyone
who likes this sort of thing, and not at all to anybody who
doesn't.</P>
