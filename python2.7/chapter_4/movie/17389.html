<PRE>***½ out of **** (VERY GOOD)</PRE>
<P>I want to correct what I wrote in a former retrospective of David Lean's
war picture. I still think that it doesn't deserve being the number 13
in the American Film Institute's list of the 100 greatest American
movies. And I think that Lumet's "12 Angry Men", Wilder's "Witness for
the Prosecution" and Kubrick's "Paths of Glory" would have been better
choices for the Best Picture Oscar in 1958. But I can't deny the
importance of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" - cinematically and in its
contents.</P>
<P>The film is set in Burma in 1943. A bataillon of British soldiers in
Japanese war captivity is forced by the Japanese to build a
strategically momentous railway bridge over the River Kwai. But the
British commanding officer, Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), insists -
corresponding to the Geneva Conventions - that his officers needn't work
as simple workmen. Struggling toughly, Col. Nicholson forces the
Japanese commandant, Col. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), to give way in this
respect. Afterwards Col. Nicholson assiduously commits himself for the
building of the bridge. He considers it an opportunity to raise his
men's morale, and he wants to prove superior British capabilities to the
Japanese. But the British High Command sends a few soldiers who shall
destroy the bridge, among them the American Shears (William Holden) - an
escapee from the Japanese prison camp - and the British Major Warden
(Jack Hawkins) ...</P>
<P>A flaw of the picture is the clichéd characterization of the Japanese
people. They are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to
the British - as if the Japanese were incapable of building a bridge.
And the film doesn't consistently question the military spirit as
Kubrick does in "Paths of Glory". Lean seems rather fascinated by the
military hierarchies. This is also perceptible in the conversations
between Col. Nicholson and Col. Saito. In this regard it is symptomatic
that Shears, who doubts the military logic, is a somehow unpleasant
person in the film. The audience is supposed to applaud Col. Nicholson's
perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the
bridge or not. The spectators are supposed to neglect the risks Col.
Nicholson takes for his men. (The plot by-passes these risks.)</P>
<P>That means, the picture isn't perfect. But it has a lot of virtues as
well. It shows the "madness" of war and what war can produce in people's
minds. It shows how Col. Nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of
being a hero and that others (like Shears) get cynics. And "The Bridge
on the River Kwai" is an interesting study of characters with clashing
interests. These points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film
an anti-war film (despite the inconsistencies in the treatment of this
theme). David Lean's effective and atmospherically perfect direction
creates a high suspense, especially in the dramatic (though not wholly
plausible) showdown. 
Alec Guinness does a magnificent job of bringing Col. Nicholson to life
and making him such an interesting character. The other actors deliver
very good performances as well. Jack Hildyard's fine color
cinematography and the apt score are also helpful.</P>
<P>I like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses.</P>
