<P>     Raise your hand if the idea of a film version of a single-set,
dialogue-heavy play sets your pulse racing. Keep it up in the air if you'd
like to cross that with a story about the hard-knocks life of professional
salesmen. Now both of you, seek immediate help from Liars Anonymous. 
Stage-to-screen translations are hard enough without dealing with the
inherent limitations of a single location. And you can't imagine there's
anything left to be said about salesmen that Arthur Miller didn't slap a
copyright on fifty years ago. Technical stagnancy and narrative 
familiarity -- yep, sign me up for a double dose of that.</P>
<P>     It's hard not to go into a film like THE BIG KAHUNA without fearing
the worst, which makes it all the more impressive when it turns out to be
a splendid acting showcase with a few eye-opening bits of wisdom. The
story is set during one night in a Wichita hotel hospitality suite, where
representatives from industrial lubricant company Lodestar Industries are
throwing a little party-cum-pitch conference. Larry (Kevin Spacey) is the
pro focused on landing a potentially huge account; Bob (Peter Facinelli) 
is the young research representative with more existential concerns; and
Phil (Danny DeVito) sits somewhere in the middle, trying to balance his
job with the big picture.</P>
<P>     Screenwriter Roger Rueff (adapting his own play HOSPITALITY SUITE) 
writes the kind of snappy dialogue that actors kill for, and all three of
the principal performers tear into it with gusto. Spacey is predictably
sensational as the marketing rep for whom honesty has become a religion; 
there may not be a performer around who can be so pleasantly venomous. It
is surprising to see DeVito match Spacey's stride in what may be his best
film performance ever. Phil's voice of experience carries a regret that's
almost tangible, turning his every utterance into something you trust
implicitly as true and worth knowing. Facinelli has the least eye-catching
role, but that doesn't mean he's a week link; it's just Bob's job to
listen and learn. Between Spacey and DeVito, there's enough blistering
comic dialogue to keep three films afloat.</P>
<P>     There's also a surprising core of understanding in THE BIG KAHUNA
about the nature of salesmanship. The film's hard-nosed philosophy -- 
which wraps God and industrial lubricants in one not-so-tidy package -- is
likely to make plenty of viewers uneasy, but it's a challenging
perspective on proselytizing as a question of product, rather than
process. The subject proves to be only one of several on which Rueff
offers insights that keep you hanging on his dialogue. It's the only way a
talk-intensive film like THE BIG KAHUNA can work: Between the wicked wit
and the provocative ideas, you're too afraid to miss something to let your
attention wander.</P>
<P>     Director John Swanbeck does have some trouble overcoming the inherent
limitations of his setting. He's stuck in that one hotel room for 90
minutes, requiring him to have characters move the furniture around when
something needs to happen besides chatter. He does include a trio of
well-crafted fantasy sequences, including one that makes wonderful use of
Facinelli's resemblance to a certain A-list star in a sequence involving
fancy bartending moves. Still, it's essentially a film in which three
characters take turns talking to each other, a set-up that's never going
to produce the most visually arresting cinema. The only reason to watch
THE BIG KAHUNA is not to watch it, but to listen to it -- to absorb some
fine writing and the work of actors who know what to do with it. It's
enough to remind you that solid execution trumps low expectations every
time.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 lives of a salesman:  7.</PRE>
