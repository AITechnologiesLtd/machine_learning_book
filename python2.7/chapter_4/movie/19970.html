<PRE>KAMIKAZE TAXI (1995)</PRE>
<PRE>        2.5 out of ****</PRE>
<P>        Starring Koji Yashuko, Kazuya Takahashi, Mickey Curtis, Taketoshi
Naito, Reiko Kataoka;
        Written & Directed by Masato Harada;
        Cinematography by Yoshinao Sakamoto</P>
<P>        You know a film is in trouble when it has to explain its premise in
an opening caption.  The caption at the beginning of KAMIKAZE TAXI tells us
three things: 1) There are 150,000 "foreign" labourers in Japan who are in
fact emigrés who have returned to their homeland, where they are treated as
second-class citizens, 2) There are 90,000 yakuza, and, 3) There are many
corrupt politicians.  The caption then observes that sometimes the lives of
these three groups converge.  We need this information because the film is
long and unfocused, its polemical intent undermined by its tortuous script.
It is part yakuza movie, part buddy movie, part road movie, part social
realism, and part a lot of other things.  Even with the introductory
explanation to guide us, it never coheres.</P>
<P>        It seems for quite a while that it will be just a yakuza movie,
centring on Tatsuo (Kazuya Takahashi), a second-rate gangster who starts
pimping for Senator Domon (Taketoshi Naito) when his predecessor is
promoted in the family.  Domon is a corrupt, xenophobic misogynist, an
aging former kamikaze pilot who seems to represent everything that
writer/director Masato Harada dislikes in Japanese society, with good
reason.  When Domon savagely beats one of the girls Tatsuo sends him,
another girl in Tatsuo's employ protests hysterically.  She is killed for
her trouble by Animaru (Mickey Curtis), a yakuza thug working for Domon.</P>
<P>        Tatsuo, who cared for the dead prostitute, is incensed by her
murder.  When he learns that the beaten girl's silence was bought with a
small offering from a huge stash of money in Domon's house, Tatsuo and some
of his buddies stage an armed robbery, making off with the Senator's money.
Tatsuo, unlike his partners in crime, survives the initial manhunt by the
yakuza, and finds himself to be very rich and very high on the yakuza's
most wanted list.  So he gets the hell out of Tokyo, wisely.</P>
<P>        The movie thus far is engaged, violent, pointed, darkly humourous,
and somewhat routine--it's just a yakuza movie, after all.  Then the
Japanese-born migrant workers enter the picture.  The abrupt shift in
direction is no less strange or arbitrary just because it is anticipated by
that opening caption.  Tatsuo, flush with wealth, hires a cab driven by
Kantake, a Japanese-Peruvian recently returned to the country, and tells
him to keep the meter running all all the way from Tokyo to Izu, where
Tatsuo wants to visit his mother's grave.  Cue road movie.  Because Kantake
is illiterate, Tatsuo has to show him the destination on a map, explaining
how to read the words.  And so the two men begin to bond.  Cue buddy movie.</P>
<P>        Once Kantake appears, the emphasis gradually shifts away from
Tatsuo, probably because Harada realizes the cab driver is the more
intriguing of the two.  He is played by the affable Koji Yashuko, currently
one of the best-known Japanese actors in the West, after starring in THE
EEL and SHALL WE DANCE? and playing a memorable secondary role as the
white-suited gangster in TAMPOPO.  Yashuko plays Kantake as a quiet-spoken,
imperturbable man, burdened by more than his fair share of hardships.  A
key early scene, a coincidental encounter with an enraged Animaru,
establishes Kantake's placid strength, and suggests that he is a man who
has seen so much trouble that Tatsuo's concerns seem trivial; a later
monologue confirms our initial impression.</P>
<P>        The movie nevertheless keeps coming back to Tatsuo and his trivial
concerns.  To honour a dying friend's request, he resolves to slaughter
Domon, Animaru, et al., in a brief blaze of kamikaze glory.  Kantake
remains stoically by Tatsuo's side, for reasons of his own: Kantake's
father, it turns out, was a kamikaze pilot with Domon during World War II,
and Kantake has cause to hate the politician for his past deeds.  The
connection between Domon and Kantake is improbable, but drives the closing
sequences, leading to a confrontation which is the film's worst scene.</P>
<P>        While Harada's politics are admirably Leftist for the most part, he
resorts to the cheap solutions of violence in the finale.  Kantake, a
serene pacifist when he first appears, becomes a kind of noble urban savage
by the end: illiterate, unsophisticated, he obtains justice by following
his heart and using his hands, brutally.  Harada seems to present this
transformation as desirable or at least necessary, contradicting the points
he was making earlier.</P>
<P>        All told, the film's political thrust seems both confused and,
after 140 minutes, belaboured.  Harada positions the film rather
transparently within political discourse on contemporary Japan.  In the
opening sequence, for instance, he shows us excerpts from sober
talking-head interviews with Japanese-born migrant workers: the tone and
method are at odds with the rest of the movie.  Elsewhere, there are clips
from televised current affairs debates featuring Senator Domon, unsubtly
underlining some of the movie's political concerns, which are too broad and
complex to be addressed by a genre picture, or, in this case, three genre
pictures spliced together.   Rather than cramming all these discrete
elements into a single film, Harada may have done better to make several
shorter, tighter movies--preferably beginning with one about Kantake.</P>
