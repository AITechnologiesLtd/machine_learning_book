<PRE>                          MEET THE PARENTS
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Ben Stiller plays a man brought
          home to meet his girlfriend's family.  With the
          religious and class differences, things would be
          bad enough, but the judgmental and unfriendly
          father, played by Robert DeNiro, may just
          destroy the entire relationship.  This is an
          uneasy blend of drama, comedy, and contrived
          slapstick that only occasionally works.  This is
          a big budget remake of the 1992 film where
          perhaps things may worked a little better in a
          more modest production.  Rating: 4 (0 to 10), 0
          (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     In China in 1982 I turned the tables on our National Guide and
asked him if he had any questions about America.  I guess I was
expecting some sort of political question.  Instead, I was
dumfounded by what was most on his mind.  "In America, do wives and
their mothers-in-law get along well?"  He assured me in China that
they did, but I am certain if that were true he would not have
asked.  Even in China people seem to have problems relating to in-
laws.  Perhaps some of life's most difficult relationships arise
when families are suddenly artificially joined by marriage.  A man
trying to relate to his new prospective in-laws and vice-versa could
be the basis of a very strong comedy.  MEET THE PARENTS does not
demonstrate that fact, however.</P>
<P>     Greg Focker (played by Ben Stiller) has been dating and in love
with Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) for ten months and is now ready to
propose to her.  He will do it during a weekend visit to meet
Debbie's family and to attend her sister's wedding.  From the
beginning the relationship is awkward between Greg and Jack and Dina
Byrnes (Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner).  Through no fault of his
own, the airline has lost Greg's luggage.  And he has to ask to
borrow clothing.  It is the beginning of a game of one-upmanship in
which Greg is nearly always one-down.  As the games go on Greg is
more and more uncomfortable and uneasy which only contributes to the
mistakes he makes.  Greg is playing a game he does not understand,
in a league he is new to.  But perhaps along the way he will
discover some unexpected secrets about his father-in-law.</P>
<P>     This film had potential in its tale of one-upmanship.  It has
hit on a situation that many in the audience may find familiar--one
that has not been done overly frequently in films.   But the script
by Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg is a little too contrived.  Too
many coincidences in the story work against Greg.  The script could
not decide if the main character was incompetent or simply unlucky.
Certainly he does not help his situation by doing everything wrong
he possibly could, but even when he is trying to do the right things
nature conspires against him.  There is an uneven mix of slapstick
sequences and human comedy.  Certainly the last part of the film
feels awkwardly written.</P>
<P>     The main reason to see MEET THE PARENTS is to see Robert
DeNiro's performance.  DeNiro plays the suspicious and not a little
fascistic father as tightly wound and threatening as he can.  The
little judgmental expressions on his face are a show in themselves
as Greg digs himself deeper and deeper into his insecurities.  But
we do not really see much of that digging.  Ben Stiller is an
affable presence in the film but is not really stretching himself by
playing the role as the nebbish to whom so many bad things happen.
It is nice to see Blythe Danner again on the screen.  But her
character has a basic conflict between a basic decency and her love
for her husband and the script should have given her more to do with
that.</P>
<P>     Randy Newman has written a playful score.  In the first few
seconds of the film it does something creative I have never heard a
film score do before.  There is a lot of source music that is
popular music of the 1960s.  Presumably that is what the upper class
listens to at least in somebody's imagination.</P>
<P>     Humor is subjective and some this film has been getting some
favorable comment.  But this is a comedy that works only
occasionally for me.  I would have to rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
