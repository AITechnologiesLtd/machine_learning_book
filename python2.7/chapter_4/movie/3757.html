<PRE>                                    AMATEUR
                       A film review by Eugene R. Ahn
                        Copyright 1995 Eugene R. Ahn</PRE>
<PRE>Directed and written by Hal Hartley
Cinematography by Michael Spiller
Music by "Ned Rifle"
Starring Martin Donovan, Isabelle Huppert, Elina Lowernsohn and
         Damian Young</PRE>
<P>     I think this is a fantastic movie to see in the mix of blockbuster
summer fare.  On a scale of 1-10, I rate this movie an 8.  In this review
I wanted to concentrate less on the plot and more on how this film
compares to Hartley's past works.</P>
<P>     To those who aren't familiar with Hal Hartley's past works
(UNBELIEVABLE TRUTH, TRUST, SIMPLE MEN), AMATEUR is the best flick to
get acquainted with this young and talented director.  It packs all of
the strengths of his past movies--great cinematography, humorous and
off-kilter dialogue, and strong central ideas--into the most
spontaneous and accessible film from Hartley yet.  In fact, after
watching this film with two Hartley-neophyte friends, they told me that
they felt it was in some ways similar to the now cultural icon, PULP
FICTION.</P>
<P>     And while that analogy is not entirely accurate, it does best
point at what makes AMATEUR so much more wildly enjoyable than his
previous works and more accessible.  Whereas Hartley's past movies
tended to focus in on the suburbs and the tame, this is the first film
of his where there are more fringe elements: pornography, mobs,
torture.  The result is a great mix of Hartley-esque humor with
spontaneity, sex and suspense.</P>
<P>     But at the same time, AMATEUR is still very much about ideas and
it is in every essence a followup to Hartley's last film, SIMPLE MEN.
One of the original endings of SIMPLE MEN was Kate (Karen Sillas)
telling the Sheriff (Damian Young), "Yes I know this man" before he
tries to arrest the protagonist (played by Robert Burke, now of Robocop
III fame).  That scene was cut from the ending since it wasn't
"essential" but it became the nucleus around which AMATEUR was built.</P>
<P>     Before I continue, I should mention that the extra information I
am drawing from comes from a published text of SIMPLE MEN and TRUST.
It features an interview with Hartley which I recommend all Hartley
fans to read if you have not.  It is very revealing and adds to the
enjoyment of watching his films.</P>
<P>     Anyhow, one of Hartley's tenets as revealed in the interview is
"... there is no escape from inequity.  One way or the other he's got to
pay ... you don't get something for nothing, ever." He's referring to the
reason why he felt Bill McCabe in SIMPLE MEN had to be arrested after
returning to Kate.  In the same vein, AMATEUR is about a once callous
man who suffers from amnesia and forgets who he was and becomes an
entirely different, albeit confused persona.  The idea behind AMATEUR
becomes a question of whether it matters to be sorry for something you
did before when you don't even remember doing it.  There are many
religious overtones, not to mention a character who is a former nun who
left the covenant after the Virgin Mary told her she wasn't fit to be
one.  The Bible has one answer, Hartley has another.</P>
<P>     But what I have always liked about Hartley's films is the way
Hartley makes tragedy watchable and bittersweetly so.  The characters
who become pawns in Hartley's tragedy are never victims but are
elevated by their thoughtful dilemmas and pains.  And I think AMATEUR
succeeds more because not only are the stakes higher, but also the very
essence of who Thomas, the amnesiac, decides he is is being
challenged.  Thomas also fights his tragic situation more than past
Hartley protagonists (with the guidance of the former nun, Isabelle)
which makes the result even more effective.</P>
<P>     There's a dialogue in SIMPLE MEN which I feel best sums up the
essential of Hal Hartley:</P>
<P>     "...the funny thing is, when you desire something you immediately
get in trouble.  And when you're in trouble you don't desire anything
at all."</P>
<P>     "I see." "It's impossible" "It's ironic." "It's a fucking
tragedy is what it is, Ned."</P>
<P>     Hal Hartley paints tragedy beautifully in AMATEUR and the best
scene is saved for last as Thomas opens the front door of the church, a
gift of faith from Isabelle misconstrued as something more sinister.
It's hard to believe, but Hal Hartley is just getting better.</P>
