<P>Swingers
Chad'z rating: ***1/2 (out of 4 = very good)
1996, R, 96 minutes [1 hour, 36 minutes]
[comedy]
starring: Jon Favreau (Mike), Vince Vaughn (Trent), Ron Livingston (Rob),
Patrick Van Horn (Sue), written by Jon Favreau, produced by Victor Simpkins,
directed by Doug Liman.</P>
<P>        Considering the success of independent films aimed at and made by
20-something GenXers, "Swingers" seems like a film that had to be made. It
follows many of the styles set recently by Kevin Smith, Richard Linklater,
and Quentin Tarantino as it comprised mostly of offbeat dialogue and comical
situations, funny dialogue, and realistic characters with a story that might
be a bit trendy but is still fun to watch.</P>
<P>        Like many recent independent comedies there really isn't a plot to this
film, it's just an exercise in characterization and dialogue. Now this has
been done before ("Clerks," "Pulp Fiction") but it's become so hip by now
it's practically a cliche, and yet this film still makes it work. </P>
<P>        The first scene establishes the basic setting and a clever layer of satire
as we meet Mike (Favreau), a struggling comedian and actor who has moved to
Los Angeles from New York and can't get over the fact his [ex-] girlfriend
hasn't called him in six months. He plays his messages and all say the same
thing, "Get over her and go out and party!" Even his answering machine joins
in the coercion.</P>
<P>        Then there is Trent (Vaughn), a producer of sorts who feels the need to take
advantage of his situation, that is: a handsome, single, Hollywood-type with
money to spend. He talks Mike into going to Las Vegas in the middle of the
night on a Wednesday and here is where the real comedy begins by showing
their "swinging" lifestyle. When they arrive in Vegas they try to make an
impression at the Black Jack tables, and a sit-com-esque atmosphere starts to
form. Although it's hilarious at the time, it also seems a bit strange, but
the film eventually finds its niche through character interaction.</P>
<P>        They don't call the film "Swingers" for nothing, so naturally the two try to
pick up women for some fast action. Needless to say this does happen but it
doesn't seem cliche in the way it happens. Favreau's script is able to
maintain a level of realism even as the film tends to go through the motions.
For example, the film does not cut straight to sex scenes, instead, it shows
Mike and Trent and their "dates" continuing their conversations even when
they go back to "her place."</P>
<P>        Most of the film depicts Mike, Trent, and their friends Rob (Livingston),
Sue (Van Horn) and Charles (Alex Desert), hanging out and hitting clubs,
bars, and parties. They see women, make eye contact, flirt with them, and
eventually go over. This might sound a little repetitive, but again, it's the
script and the realistic dialogue that makes this film different. These guys
talk and act like real men, they know what women want to hear and don't act
nor talk like movie characters, but like realistic, horny men. They're not
just out for sex, you can tell deep down they want a relationship, but conside
ring who they are what the premise of the film is, there's no way that will
happen.</P>
<P>        I've noticed films about nihilism like this tend to end on conservative
notes, but often they become sappy and/or just plain cheesy, but that doesn't
happen here. Mike is constantly whining about not being able to meet the
right woman and about how hard it is to get over his girlfriend, so guess
what happens to him?</P>
<P>        Some might say "Swingers" is just another independent, plotless, slightly
raunchy, character and dialogue-driven GenX comedy, but there isn't nearly
enough films like this (at least good ones) to refer to it as "just another."
Even if it was, it's still good and you have to respect that.</P>
