<P>The on-screen pairing of Hollywood A-listers Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts has 
been much publicized in the press, as well as the major selling point for 
"The Mexican," a romantic comedy-action-drama directed by Gore Verbinski 
(1997's "Mouse Hunt"). Those viewers expecting them to appear in every scene 
together will be sorely disappointed, as they are a whole country away from 
each other for at least ninety minutes of its running time. If they take this 
initial letdown in stride, however, and view the movie for what it is, they 
will find a quirky, smart gem of a movie that is not only fun to watch, but 
has quite a few meaningful things to say about life, love, and death.</P>
<P>Jerry Welbach (Brad Pitt) is having a lot of bad luck. A relative simpleton 
whose strong-willed, long-time girlfriend, Samantha (Julia Roberts), has just 
broken up with him after discovering he hasn't yet broken off his ties with a 
powerful crime lord, Jerry is now in Mexico to retrieve a prized, mystical 
pistol known as "the mexican." Things turn complicated when he witnesses a 
murder, has his rental car stolen, and gets into more and more high water 
with the people connected to his snatching the pistol.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Samantha has hit the road to Las Vegas. While stopping at a 
shopping mall en route, she is kidnapped by Leroy (James Gandolfini), a 
sweet-natured hitman who plans to hold her hostage until he gets hold of the 
gun. At first, Samantha is angered at Jerry, whom she truly, unadulteratedly 
loves, for getting her into such a mess, but she begins to talk with Leroy, 
and starts up an offbeat, trusting friendship with him as she aids in helping 
him to discover his true self.</P>
<P>It is the one-of-a-kind, burgeoning relationship between Samantha and Leroy 
that forms the heart and soul of "The Mexican," as it gives the movie an 
amount of depth that it would have otherwise not had. With Jerry off in 
Mexico having dangerous misadventures of his own, the film alternates between 
the two star-crossed characters and their eclectic locations. While Jerry's 
portion is plot-heavy and relatively jokey, Sam and Leroy's steal the whole 
show, thanks to the bright writing, from a screenplay by J.H. Wyman, and the 
lovely camaraderie and chemistry that stars Julia Roberts (2000's "Erin 
Brockovich") and James Gandolfini (TV's "The Sopranos") have together. Their 
relationship is a strictly platonic one (Sam quickly zeroes in on the fact 
that Leroy is gay, but has several problems with connecting to others), but 
the way it builds and strengthens as the story progresses makes for a 
wonderfully human, good-natured piece of entertainment. </P>
<P>As her Oscar-nominated turn in "Erin Brockovich" confirmed, once and for all, 
Julia Roberts is not only the biggest actress in the world, but also one of 
the most assured and talented. Taking on a part that has little in common 
with most of her previous big-screen ventures, Roberts sparkles as Samantha, 
a beautiful, ambitious woman who can't help loving Jerry, despite their 
seemingly never-ending problems. And James Gandolfini is a standout, creating 
and developing Leroy into one of the most memorable supporting characters in 
recent years. Leroy's progression in being able to start a relationship with 
a guy he meets in a coffee shop is understated and realistic, and the fear he 
has in having people find out his illegal profession is believably palpable. 
Gandolifini is on target throughout, and there could have, and almost should 
have, been an entire movie revolving solely around his character and Roberts'.</P>
<P>The Jerry section, while paling in comparison, is still involving enough to 
work, although the intentionally over-the-top spaghetti western-like music 
score, by Alan Silvestri, that plays consistently through much of his screen 
time quickly grows tedious. Brad Pitt (2001's "Snatch") holds up his own end 
of the picture as the occasionally dimwitted Jerry, and gets to show off his 
loose comedic skills in a way that he rarely gets to.</P>
<P>Appearing together for the opening five minutes, and not again until the 
final half-hour, Roberts and Pitt manage to create a romantic chemistry, 
nonetheless. We truly feel like they are in love with each other (after all, 
you only argue the way they do in this movie when you love someone this way), 
even when the Mexican border is keeping them apart. </P>
<P>For all of its strong points, "The Mexican" makes a minor misstep in the 
final act, with a climax that doesn't seem all that necessary and is 
needlessly drawn out. The last twenty minutes could have been almost 
completely cut out, and it would have made little difference, aside from the 
action not flagging the way it does in this final product. Still, its 
overlong nature does not tarnish the powerful lasting impressions that "The 
Mexican" makes on you. It's a fine film, both funny and poignant, violent and 
biting, charming and purposeful. In other words, yet another completely 
respectable career choice for both Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt, as well as a 
star-making one for James Gandolfini.</P>
