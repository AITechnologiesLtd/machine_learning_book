<P>Everyone's heard about this movie, and more specifically, *the* scene.
Everyone's heard the famous barnyard animal quote squealed (no pun
intended) over and over.  And everyone's got to admit that they will never
travel down a river again without thinking of DELIVERANCE.  Good!  That's
what you're supposed to do!  Oh, if you are one of the ones who hasn't
seen this yet, or you (somehow) haven't heard about what happens, here's
your spoiler warning.</P>
<P>DELIVERANCE was a real shocker for it's time (1972).  Major advances were
being made in films, and DELIVERANCE made its own advances when it
introduced a new horror into the film industry.  When it was first
released, it literally shocked the audiences.  It was something
that, for the most part, had really never been seen on the big screen
before (among wide-release films with an R rating).  But by today's film
standards and in today's world, such scenes as the one in DELIVERANCE can
be reproduced in a way that isn't as shocking, although they can be even
more graphic (e.g. PULP FICTION).  PULP FICTION did it in a way, and
expanded on it in a way, that it could even be interpreted as funny.  But
in 1972, DELIVERANCE was no laughing matter.</P>
<P>The story centers around a group of four Atlanta men who decide to take a
rafting trip down a backwoods river in Georgia while the river is still
there and in its glory.  The initial leader of the group is Lewis (Burt
Reynolds in his prime), a real outdoorsman and more of a Daniel Boone-type
then any of the others.  Joining him are Ed (Jon Voight), Bobby (Ned
Beatty), and Drew (Ronny Cox).</P>
<P>The group's first objective is to find someone(s) to drive their cars down
the river to the point where they will end their trip.  They make
arrangements with a few mountain men, who accept $40.00 for the task.
Drew also has the famous "dueling banjos" competition with a local who is,
let us say, genetically challenged.</P>
<P>The men then set off down the river, with Lewis, also the master at
canoeing, leading the way.  Everything seems to be going fine, until the
two canoes split up, leaving the unexperienced Ed and Bobby alone.  They
encounter two hillbillies, armed with a shotgun, who captured them.  Ed is
tied to a tree while Bobby is sodomized by one of the men.  Ed nearly
receives the same cruelty, but Lewis arrives just in time to fire an arrow
through the rapist's back.  The other hillbilly gets away, and the men
have to decide what to do with the dead body.  Disposing of dead bodies
is done rather frequent throughout this film.</P>
<P>While attempting to make a quick "paddle for it", both canoes tip over.
Drew, who was without a life jacket, was possibly shot and cannot be
found.  Lewis suffered a rather nasty compound fracture during the
incident and is in serious condition.  This leaves Ed and Bobby.  Ed
decides to go out and look for the remaining hillbilly, alone, with the
bow and arrow.  The question arises if he will be able to handle himself,
as he horribly botched a first shot attempt at a deer, to which his
comment "I wonder how anyone could kill a living thing" will have more
meaning in the future.</P>
<P>DELIVERANCE is definitely a wild ride (oops, I'm doing it again).  It is
extremely tense at some points and very dramatic.  It's definitely one of
those "must see" movies and should be considered one of the classics of
its decade.</P>
