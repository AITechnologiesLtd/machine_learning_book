<PRE>                               THE FRIGHTENERS
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     GHOSTBUSTERS meets TWIN PEAKS?  Michael J. Fox's comeback movie?  A
film about a lazy guy who catches ghosts for a living?  A supporting cast
of unknowns?  Does anyone want to see a movie like this?</P>
<P>     *Yes!*  And you'd better get to the theater quick, because THE
FRIGHTENERS, in a manner suggested be the above questions, will not make
huge waves at the box office in a crowded field of summer blockbusters.</P>
<P>     Nevertheless, THE FRIGHTENERS is one of those gems that deserves to be
seen for its fresh and funny approach to the horror genre.  Peter Jackson,
writer-director and master of schlock, is behind the camera for the first
time since 1994's HEAVENLY CREATURES.  His tale this time is most simply
described as... GHOSTBUSTERS meets TWIN PEAKS.</P>
<P>     It all starts with spirit-chaser Frank Bannister (Fox), whom everyone
thinks is a con-man except for the unhappy Lucy (Trini Alvarado).  And when
people suddenly start turning up mysteriously dead in the town of
Fairwater, Frank becomes Suspect #1.  While the cops and feds come after
him, Frank starts a witch hunt of his own, chasing a Grim Reaper-type
character who is really responsible.  Meanwhile, Frank's spiritual friends
come to his aid.</P>
<P>     No, the one-paragraph description doesn't do it justice, but trust me,
after 30 minutes of rough exposition, Jackson hits his stride, even if it
doesn't make a whole lot of sense until 10 minutes from the end.  No
matter, because the payoff is worth it, and along the way we are treated to
the end-result of the morphing effects Jackson began meddling with in
HEAVENLY CREATURES.</P>
<P>     Even better is a performance by co-star Alvarado, who steals the show
from Fox *and* the ghosts (not an easy feat) with her graceful beauty and
excellent acting ability.  If I were a studio exec, I'd be throwing lots
and lots of money at her right now, because this girl (who most recently
appeared in LITTLE WOMEN, is going to be a star.  I have to admire
Jackson's casting ability -- after all, he discovered Kate Winslet for
HEAVENLY, now Alvarado... who's next?  (Me!)</P>
<P>     And my gushing about fair Trini is not to detract from Fox or the
other co-stars, the most notable of which are R. Lee Ermey, recreating (as
a ghost) his sergeant role from FULL METAL JACKET, and Jeffrey Combs (yes,
THE RE-ANIMATOR himself), as the most twisted FBI agent you'll ever see on
film.</P>
<P>     Jackson's innovative use of flashback and humor overcome the script's
shortcomings and some surprisingly bad (and annoying) voice dubbing, but
only if you give the film a chance to pick up some steam.  Early judges
will not be pleased.  Jackson's fans will be elated.</P>
