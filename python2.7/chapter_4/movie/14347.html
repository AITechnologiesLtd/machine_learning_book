<PRE>    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>The Spanish have a knack for the surrealistic, and really weird sometimes.</P>
<P>The story is about a fading 'star' actress that retreats at midlife to
Mexico ( very common ) in order to keep her career going.  And her daughter
stays behind.  Several years later, she returns to Spain, and gets all kinds
of attention ( publicity ) by the press.</P>
<P>The daughter married her former lover and producer.  And the mother
rekindles her affair with him as well.  And the whole thing gets tangled up
so badly that one wonders what is going to happen next.</P>
<P>Amidst all this, there is a cross dresser who does the night club circuit by
singing several songs by the famous actress.  And this person has a very
special mark, by which he is known.</P>
<P>There are many traces of Luis Bunuel in this film.  The story appears to be
a real mess until it cleverly gets tied up.  And even several characters are
hanging in thin air, because they don't know what is going on.  And of
course the DEUX EX MACHINA works very well, and cleans up the whole
thing.......ohh well.</P>
<P>It's a funny film at various moments, and it is at times really poor,
reminding me of some really bad soap operas found on the Mexican stations.
This film by Pedro Aldomovar is a good film and it has its bits of fun.  And
it is kind of fun not knowing what is going to happen.</P>
<P>It's worth seeing when you are curious about something else which you have
not seen.   The Spanish surrealism, and political in jokes may leave you
cold, but they are funny.  Typical Spanish offering.  You can't make out
weather it is serious or just fun.</P>
<PRE>SEE IT, when you want another film.</PRE>
