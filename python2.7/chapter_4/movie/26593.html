<P>The heavy message and soul-searing images in BAMBOOZLED took a lot out
of me, so I looked forward to seeing a light comedy afterwards.  And
BEDAZZLED was about as light as it tolerably gets.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
BEDAZZLED, a remake of the 1967 Faustian romantic comedy starring Dudley
Moore as the hapless soul willing to sell his soul to Peter Cook's
Devil, stars Brendan Fraser as Elliot Richards (aka The Hapless Soul)
and Elizabeth Hurley as The Devil.</P>
<P>Poor dorky Elliot is a computer consultant living the stereotypical geek
life; he tries too hard to get people to like him, his co-workers
(including a restrained Orlando Jones as Dan) don't want to hang out
with him, and the girl of his dreams, Allison (Frances O'Connor), barely
knows he's alive.  When Elliot wishes aloud that he'd do anything to
have Allison in his life, The Devil appears - to see if "anything"
includes Elliot's soul, in exchange for seven "be careful what you wish
for" wishes.</P>
<P>Naturally - you guessed it - Wackiness Ensues.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
You've heard me say it before: remakes generally grind my gizzards.
This one, though, didn't seem to bother me as much, for some reason.
Elizabeth Hurley is no Peter Cook; likewise, Brendan Fraser can't touch
the Comedy Stylings of Dudley Moore.  But Fraser and Hurley worked
reasonably well together, the ObPuns weren't too obviously painful [The
"DV8" Club.  Ha.] and the supporting players were given enough to do
(especially in the basketball wish segment) to not totally make one
wonder why they were given individual names (instead of "Elliot's Friend
One, Two, and Three").  And though the movie petered out once the
"...and what did we learn?" phase kicked into high gear, the fun of
watching dorky Elliot come back even more wacky as the butt uuuuugly
Sensitive Guy, was worth suffering through the obvious Lesson we were
meant to learn about Being Happy With Ourselves.</P>
<P>[Why yes, that was the shortest review I've done to date.  What else is
there to say?  "I laughed, I didn't cry, I didn't want to run away and
join the circus"?  It was a fun way to waste 93 minutes.  It's not
exactly brain surgery, y'know].</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
I must've gotten too much of whatever The Devil gave to Elliot to make
him so emotionally sensitive.  Can't figure out why else I'd notice the
opening credit labels "she" placed on the jumping African ("Bad Credit")
or the old Black diner patron ("Tips 5%").  I'm sure it was just an
after-effect of having been Awakened by BAMBOOZLED not long before
watching this movie.  Besides, the BF in BEDAZZLED can't be all that
bad, considering who "God" wound up being...</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
A cute remake that is neither earthshakingly funny nor overly
sacrilegious (to the original, that is), BEDAZZLED provided enough
laughs to make it worth seeing once.  Though unless you're a glutton for
punishment like me (having seen four new movies over two days), you
might want to put it off for the matinee.</P>
<P>BEDAZZLED (rating: flashing yellowlight):
But now I miss Dudley Moore and Peter Cook that much more.</P>
