<PRE>                              THAT THING YOU DO!
                       A film review by John Robertson
                        Copyright 1996 John Robertson</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Tom Hanks 
Starring: Tom Everett Scott Steve Zahn, Charlize Theron, Johnathon Schaech, 
Ethan Embry, Liv Tyler, Tom Hanks </P>
<P>Perfect Person Rating*: The Perfect Person for this film is someone who wants 
a toe-tapping, no complications, feel-good movie.  I mean all of the previous 
descriptives literally.  If you want SOME complications, you won't like this 
movie.  The Perfect Person for this movie would probably give it a 10 out of 
10. See the review below for more information. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------- </P>
<P>That Thing You Do is, as you are all aware by now, the pet project of Tom 
Hanks, probably the most likable guy in Hollywood.  I can just picture the 
scene in Hollywood, as Tom proposed this picture to "the studio people", and 
they all bent over backwards to let him make it.  I'm glad he got the chance, 
because although That Thing You Do isn't exactly high cinema, it's certainly 
better than most things that Hollywood spits out, and it's nice to see nice 
guys finishing where they belong.</P>
<P>That Thing You Do is set in 60s Erie Pennsylvania, home of Guy Patterson, a 
wannabe jazz drummer, and a garage band called the "One-ders".  The One-ders 
are about to enter a talent competition, and when their drummer hurts his arm 
jumping over a parking meter, they call on Guy, the town's only beatnik, to 
help them out.  At the competition, Guy starts their big song, "That Thing You 
Do" much faster than they are used to, but what do you know?  The crowd loves 
it and the band's career is launched.   The song is pretty special, and you 
would have to really not like music to not get your toe tapping to it.</P>
<P>That's about all you need to know about That Thing You Do.  The rest of the 
movie follows their career to the top, and in a way, it's a refreshing story 
never told before.  Their agent lives in a motor home and doesn't seem to have 
two dimes to rub together, but he doesn't exploit them, betray them or do 
anything except make them famous and turn them over to a record exec, who 
doesn't exploit them, betray them or do anything except make them MORE famous! 
 Does that sound surprising to you?  It was to me!</P>
<P>In a way, this movie was almost like a thriller, in that I couldn't predict 
what going to happen until it was all over.  We have been so programmed to 
think the worst of entertainment people, especially in the movies, that when 
everyone, and I mean everyone, is on the level, it seems like a daring plot 
twist.</P>
<P>It wasn't until That Thing You Do was over that I felt a little disappointed.  
I had a vague feeling of "Is that it?"  There is not very much in the way of 
conflict in this movie.  Jimmy, the band's front man, is sullen and 
argumentative, but seems to relent almost instantly.  The final couple of 
conflicts at the end seem almost implausible and completely manufactured -- 
but let's be honest, you needed some sort of conflict to bring this movie to a 
close, and they were in keeping with the overall tone of the movie.  </P>
<P>I think this is a good movie for the Perfect Person rating system, because  I 
think it will be VERY popular with most of the moviegoing public, but quite 
frankly, it will probably drive most reviewers crazy.  </P>

<P>* Perfect Person Rating: The Perfect Person Rating is an attempt to give the 
reader a new way of understanding my rating. Rather than give a film a score, 
either overall, or on several attributes, the Perfect Person Rating tries to 
identify the type of person would enjoy this movie the most. Since a reviewer 
is by nature someone with a great deal of experience in what they are 
reviewing, their experience may not be the same as someone who is less jaded, 
or more attuned to the subject. Hopefully the Perfect Person Rating will go 
further toward eliminating reviewer bias than a simple rating scale. Comments 
are appreciated. </P>
