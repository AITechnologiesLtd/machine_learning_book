                          THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR
                    A film review by Christopher Null
                     Copyright 1999 Christopher Null

<P>     I want to start by mentioning that I actually work on the 13th
floor of a real live building in downtown San Francisco.  My business
card actually reads `13th Floor'.  Reading my business card is more
interesting than this film.</P>
<P>     Interesting premise: Computer geniuses build a virtual reality
machine that lets them go back in time to 1937 Los Angeles.  Only the
virtual people have feelings and emotions just like us; they don't know
they're not real.  But then they find out.</P>
<P>     Horrible execution: Working from a screenplay from Rusnak and
Centeno-Rodriguez – neither of whom have written anything I've ever
heard of – and under the direction of Rusnak – whose only
English-language credit is as second unit director on GODZILLA, THE
THIRTEENTH FLOOR has little to no raw talent behind it.  Rusnak
obviously couldn't put together a love scene if he was in it himself
with Cindy Crawford - the film's little tryst between Bierko and Mol
drew howls of laughter from our audience.</P>
<P>     On technical merits, FLOOR is an even bigger failure.  I haven't
seen a film in the last 20 years that has such bad lighting and poor
choice of film stock.  And I'd be remiss without pointing to the
hideously flawed soundtrack on our test print – or maybe it was the
theater.  (Maybe that was a blessing.)</P>
<P>     After two good VR flicks: THE MATRIX and EXISTENZ, I suppose we
were ripe for a failure in going for three in a row.  You know, in most
buildings, the thirteenth floor doesn't exist.</P>
<PRE>     If only we had been so lucky.</PRE>
