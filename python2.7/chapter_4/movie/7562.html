<P>     VILLAGE OF DREAMS, the latest feature from respected Japanese 
director Higashi Yoichi, uses a languorous pace and stunning visuals to 
tell the simple-yet-effective story of a period in the life of two boys 
growing up in suburban Kyoto shortly after the conclusion of the second 
World War.  The movie, which transpires in a peaceful, out-of-the-way 
locale and is told from a child's point-of-view, functions as a reminder 
of a simpler, less-hurried Japan.</P>
<P>     The film is based on the autobiographical account of picture-book 
artists Tashima Seizo and his twin brother, Yukihiko (who both appear as 
they are today in a brief prologue).  At the age of 8, Seizo and 
Yukihiko lead a relatively normal existence:  they go to school, play 
pranks, and enjoy halcyon afternoons fishing and capturing small 
animals.  They also have active imaginations.  VILLAGE OF DREAMS 
features more than a dash of magic realism with its depiction of witches 
in trees, imps hiding in undergrowth, and talking fish.  </P>
<P>     The simplicity of the plot allows the characters room to grow and 
breathe.  Seizo and Yukihiko are firmly at the center of the film for 
its entire duration.  We see the world through their eyes -- a strange, 
wonderful, sometimes-frightening place where simple walks in the woods 
can turn into great adventures.  Then, as Seizo and Yukihiko become 
aware of the differences between the male and female body, the issue of 
sexual curiosity comes to the fore.  There's even a memorable hypothesis 
about why a girl doesn't have a penis.</P>
<P>     Visually, VILLAGE OF DREAMS is a beautiful, evocative piece of work 
that achieves much of its effectiveness through its visuals of the 
twins' rural village and the surrounding woods.  The film is all about 
memories and the past -- a retrospective of a society that no longer 
exists as it once did and a catalyst for us to remember those long-ago 
days when we gazed upon the world with the wide-eyed enthusiasm of a 
child.</P>
