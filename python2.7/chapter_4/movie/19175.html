<PRE>BY AARON LINSKEY</PRE>
<P>Racism is a horrible thing that has not been really put to film
much. A few films stick in my mind as anti-racist but most films that
stand up for other religions. Schindler's List was the last great
anti-racism film.  American History X is the newest.</P>
<P>Derek Vinyard has had a tormented life. His father was murdered while
he was a teenager and Derek's life changed completely. He became the
leader of a Nazi group in Venice Beach, California. After a horrible
crime is committed Derek is sent to prison. He leaves with him his
mother Doris (Beverly D'Angelo), his sister Davina (Jennifer Lien),
and his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong)</P>
<P>Years later when Derek is let out of prison he comes to see a shaved
head Nazi Danny. Derek has been reformed the hardness of prison and he
is shocked at how evil Danny has become. He tries desparately to
change his younger brother. He shocks his former friends with his
reformed self and this sets off a night long adventure of running and
trying to set things right.</P>
<P>Edward Norton gives the performance of his career as Derek. Flashback
scenes show him musclebound, which is not like his tall and skinny
self, which Norton pulls off the know-how many veteran actors don't
reach. He conveys the evil that is rippling in every tattooed muscle
in flashbacks and a older brother approach for his present day scenes
out of prison. Edward Furlong also does a great job as Danny who is
titering between good and evil when Derek gets out of prison. He still
looks as he did in his debut Terminator 2: Judgement Day but he can
act a lot more now.</P>
<P>Director Tony Kaye, who's only past credits were commericals, was not
happy with the final print. He claims Edward Norton took over the film
and made a lot of cuts. If he did than he should be actor and editor
for the next movie. Kaye is very good in his debut doing both
directing and cinematographing. I don't know how much was Kaye's
original product but maybe we will see his cut on DVD as a director's
cut in the future. The current cut is good enough for me though.</P>
<P>This film is brutal. The Nazi scenes are violent, bloody, and hateful
as are the prison scenes. The flashbacks of Derek's past in prison and
as leader of the Venice Beach groups are all filmed in black and white
much like Schindler's List. I'm not exactly sure why Kaye decided to
film the flashbacks like this but it doesn't effect the flow of the
movie.</P>
<P>Some complaints I've heard about this film are mostly script
related. I can't find anything wrong with David McKenna's script. My
only complaint is that the film is awfully short. This lessens the
epic or classic feeling a film like this usually has. That's a very
small complaint though and doesn't change my rating much.</P>
<P>I've heard a lot of horrible racist stories in my life. Thank God I've
never had to experience any though. I grew up hearing stories about
how my ancestors who lived along the Civil War times and as recently
as their teens in the 1950s and 1960s. The stories are sickening and
shock you into not creating stories of your own. American History X
feels just like one of these stories only we actually get to see the
carnage.</P>
<P>Doug Galecawitz from Darien, Illinois wrote into the Internet Movie
Database (www.imdb.com) and posted a review to this film. He typed in
it that he saw American History X with his friend who had been a Nazi
and a raccist before. Doug says his friend hung his head in shame
while walking out of this movie. This film will scare both current
Nazis and people who want to be Nazis into a life of happiness. This
is the kind of film that should be mandatory viewing for high
schoolers. No school violence or discrimination would be fantastic.</P>
