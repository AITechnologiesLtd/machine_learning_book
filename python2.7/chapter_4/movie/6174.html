<PRE>                               Michael Collins (1996)
                        A film review by Christopher Null
                         Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     The time between 1916 and the 1920s saw the worst of a revolt that
caused the creation the IRA and heightened the fight for independence
between Ireland and the crown in London.  At the head of this fight,
like it or not, was Michael Collins, a demagogue/saboteur/freedom
fighter that lived as a hero and died a martyr.</P>
<P>     Read it once again -- this is *not* BRAVEHEART.  BRAVEHEART took
place something like 600 years earlier, and just a stone's throw across
the North Channel, in Scotland.</P>
<P>     Otherwise, it's the same movie, except Neil Jordan's paean to the
Irish hero leaves much to be desired by the discriminating viewer. 
Jordan, best known for his masterpiece THE CRYING GAME, really seems to
be falling apart these days (did *you* stay awake during INTERVIEW WITH
THE VAMPIRE?).  Now he's back with MICHAEL COLLINS, a rambling,
138-minute epic that could have easily been cut to 90, and has its good
points and its bad -- but the bad really stick out like sore thumbs.</P>
<P>     Using more scrolling title cards than I've ever seen before, at
first I thought MICHAEL COLLINS was going to be a read-along.  But
instead of incorporating this information about Collins (Liam Neeson)
into the story, Jordan tacks on the printed Michael Collins at-a-glance
biography and just plugs the movie full of the same sequence over and
over again.  (That sequence is this:  the IRA guys are asleep, then the
Brits come on a raid, then the IRA guys get away just in time.  Whew!)</P>
<P>     Then there's the what-on-earth-were-you-thinking decision to put
Julia Roberts in this movie as Kitty Kiernan, the woman torn between
Collins and his once-best friend Harry Boland (Aidan Quinn).  Seriously,
my Irish accent is better than Roberts's, and I'm from *Texas*.</P>
<P>     The real story of Michael Collins may be a good one -- full of
intrigue, infighting with the Irish President Eamon De Valera (Alan
Rickman), bloody war with the English, and a struggle to get the girl
with the bad Irish accent.  The problem is that Jordan tells the story
like it's a history lesson, and a dull one at that.  Yes, the movie's
full of good acting (exception noted above), gory violence, and lavish
sets (all of which are blown up by the end of the film), but it ends up
being just another over-indulgent sermon by a misguided preacher.</P>
<PRE>     Think of your $6.50 as an offering.</PRE>
