<PRE>                         INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Kirsten Dunst, Antonio Banderas.
Screenplay:  Anne Rice.
Director:  Neil Jordan.</P>
<P>     INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE has far more in common with MARY
SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN than a November release date.  To begin with the
obvious, both are based on florid novels featuring "monsters" in
existential crisis, rooted deeply in the authors' feelings of loss.
And both were the subject of intense pre-release scrutiny as a result
of off-beat casting decisions.  However, the most relevant--and
unfortunate--similarity between the two is what ends up on the
screen.  INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE is a spectacularly executed
production, perhaps more consistent in its tone than FRANKENSTEIN, but
it also lacks that film's high points; it's simply too plot-heavy, and
ends up feeling extremely rushed.</P>
<P>     The story is told in flashback, as 200-year-old Louis de Pointe du
Lac (Brad Pitt) tells the story of his life to a young interviewer
(Christian Slater) in contemporary San Francisco.  In 1791 New Orleans,
plantation owner Louis despairs over the deaths of his wife and
daughter, a despair sensed by the vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise).  Lestat
offers Louis the chance to become like him, but after he accepts, he
soon realizes the implications of his choice--a bloodlust he loathes
but can't resist.  When Louis contemplates leaving Lestat, Lestat
creates another vampire, the child Claudia (Kirsten Dunst).  But Louis
and Claudia still rebel, and attempt to find out more about their
nature when they travel to Paris and find a cadre of vampires led by
the seductive Armand (Antonio Banderas).</P>
<P>     First, to the single most pressing question to anyone familiar
with Anne Rice's novel:  is Tom Cruise an acceptable Lestat?  The
answer is, sometimes.  There are moments, and not isolated ones, where
Cruise is positively fiendish, more so than one could have any right to
hope.  There are also moments when he is so completely wrong that every
fear of his detractors appears to have been justified, and this
schizophrenia is typical of the bumps in INTERVIEW.  More damaging
still is Brad Pitt, the real star of the film as Louis.  He has said in
interviews that he grew to hate playing the depressive vampire, and
that fact is sadly evident in his performance, a dazed and lackluster
turn.  Both Pitt and Cruise are put to shame by eleven-year-old Kirsten
Dunst, who does riveting work as the vampire who becomes a woman
trapped in a child's body.  She becomes the tortured soul whose plight
truly connects with the audience in a way that Louis's should have, but
never does.</P>
<P>     Part of the problem is that among the elements of Rice's novel
which are altered or abandoned, the one which is most ill-advised is
ignoring Louis's religiosity.  His despair is linked to a very Catholic
sense of guilt, and when all reference to his faith is excised he loses
a critical motivating factor.  Often his reluctance to take human lives
comes off as mere distaste, rather than a profound fear that he has
become an agent of the devil, or that there may be no God to judge
him.</P>
<P>     Of course, this is one of the dangers inherent in doing a big
Hollywood adaptation of what is essentially an interior monologue.
Director Neil Jordan has filmed the story beautifully, busing Philippe
Rousselot's cinematography to perfection, and scenes like the Theater
of Vampires production are nearly ideal translations from the novel.
The production design is magnificent, and Elliot Goldenthal's score is
a great mood setter.  It looks so good that occasionally I could
overlook the fact that in their rush to pack as much plot as possible
into two hours, Jordan and Rice had severely skimped on their
characters' motivations.  This is not to say that there haven't been
some significant improvements made from the novel, particularly adding
some much-needed black humor.  But for INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE to
work as anything besides simply spectacle, Louis had to becomes
something besides a pouting immortal, and Lestat had to be something
more than a sporadically zany eternal adolescent.  Lestat is more like
an abusive father, and that relationship is very poorly handled.
INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE ends up positively gorgeous, and extremely
hollow.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 vampires:  5.</PRE>
