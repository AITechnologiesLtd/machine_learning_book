<P>     ALL THE BOYS AND GIRLS IN THEIR TIME is a series of films 
commissioned by the French-German TV station Arte.  Ten directors were 
asked to participate by making a movie about their teenage years.  Each 
film had to include at least one party scene which highlighted the music 
of the time.  TRAVOLTA AND ME, Patricia Mazuy's entry, transpires in 
1978 and (not surprisingly, given the title) takes its inspiration from 
U.S. disco and SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER.   </P>
<P>     For those of my generation, TRAVOLTA AND ME holds a strong 
nostalgic component.  Beyond that, this is a nice period piece that has 
limited success muddling its way through the teenage angst engendered by 
a first love.  The main character, Christine, is wildly infatuated with 
American actor John Travolta until she meets real life heartthrob 
Nicolas.  While the boy sees Christine as just another potential 
conquest (and an opportunity to win a bet with his friends), she falls 
head-over-heels for him.  What follows starts out as a pleasant 
examination of coping with youthful passion and the pressure to have 
sex, but ends in a wildly over-the-top look at what many teenagers wish 
they could do. </P>
<P>     In its restrained moments, TRAVOLTA AND ME is an effective, often-
moving look at one girl's struggles with the conflicting desires created 
by the approach of adulthood.  When the story is focused, it works.  
However, things become unbalanced near the end as Mazuy permits all 
sorts of strange and unbelievable events to take place.  These lend an 
unreal aura to the final twenty minutes that distances us from 
characters we're still getting to know, dulling the impact of the 
concluding sequence and dampening an otherwise fine character study. </P>
