<P>"There's Something About Mary" is gross and offensive. It's poorly paced, 
often sluggish and about a half hour too long. A lot of the comedy bits 
fall flat and the ones that do work depend on shock value, mining cheap 
laughs from animal abuse, bodily fluids, pratfalls, humiliation and 
injury, while mocking physically and mentally handicapped people along 
with the elderly. Disgusting and utterly juvenile, "There's Something 
About Mary" is also the funniest film I've seen in a very long time. So 
sue me.</P>
<P>Created by the Farrelly brothers, the "visionaries" who gave the world 
"Dumb and Dumber" and "Kingpin," "There's Something About Mary" is the 
kind of no-holds-barred comedy reminiscent of "Blazing Saddles," "Animal 
House" and "Airplane." It's not really in the same league, though. The 
humor in those films was consistent, while "There's Something About Mary" 
only hits the high marks occasionally, with a lot of dead spots in-
between. Oh, but when it works, this puppy is absolutely hilarious.</P>
<P>The story begins in 1985, when Ted Stroehmann (Ben Stiller), a dorky high-
school student, bonds with the radiant Mary Jenson (Cameron Diaz) when he 
attempts to rescue her retarded brother Warren (W. Earl Brown) from a 
bully. Mary asks Ted to the prom and everything's coming up roses for the 
love-struck doofus until that fateful prom night when disaster hits, 
courtesy of a nightmarish escalating series of blunders, culminating in a 
zipper accident of historic proportions.</P>
<P>Cut to 13 years later, when Ted takes the suggestion of his friend Dom 
(Chris Elliott) and hires private eye Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to find out 
where Mary is living. The sleazy detective locates Mary in Miami and 
promptly falls for her. After feeding Ted bogus info to dissuade him from 
pursuing his lost love, Pat uses eavesdropping devices to learn what Mary 
wants in a man, then attempts to become that guy. Meanwhile, Ted learns 
the truth and heads south to try and pick up where he left off before 
that awful night with the zipper.</P>
<P>That's a lot of plot for a comedy and "There's Something About Mary" gets 
sluggish while trying to juggle all of its subplots and characters. 
Speaking of characters, the Farrelly boys aren't exactly famous for well 
drawn ones, and the film spends too much time getting up close and 
personal with some pretty sketchy people. </P>
<P>When the Farrellys wrench themselves away from the romantic contrivances 
and focus on the big jokes, "There's Something About Mary" kicks into 
high gear. The film contains a generous number of elaborate low-humor set 
pieces that pay off wonderfully, because of the brothers' willingness to 
take things way, way, way over the top. They set up a tasteless gag, then 
carry it light years further than most comic filmmakers would dare. </P>
<P>The zipper scene, for example, succeeds precisely because of overkill. 
Instead of settling for one painful laugh when poor Ted gets his package 
lodged in those cruel metal teeth, they keep pushing the envelope. Mary's 
father comes to help, humiliating the boy with his horrified double-take. 
Then he calls in Mom for a look-see, as the boy tries desperately to 
crawl behind the wallpaper. Then the police and firefighters arrive. Just 
when you think it's impossible to carry the gruesome joke any farther, 
they do, by giving us an explicit look at Ted's mangled genitals. Oh, the 
humanity!</P>
<P>If you think that's disgusting, skip this movie, because the Farrellys 
are just getting warmed up. There's also the drugged dog scene, the gay 
rest stop scene, the fish hook scene, the leather-skinned old woman's 
bare breast scene, and an extremely gross, incredibly funny masturbation 
bit that delivers one of the film's most side-splitting laughs, thanks to 
Mary's blissfully cheerful ignorance of the ickiness around her.</P>
<P>All the gags don't work, of course. The Farrellys have a fixation with 
facial blemishes and the zit and hives visuals aren't particularly funny. 
Most of the jokes mocking Mary's retarded brother Warren fall flat. The 
audience at the screening I attended were clearly resistant to the whole 
notion of making fun of the disabled. When the film was laughing with 
Warren, they the audience joined in. When it laughed at him, they didn't. 
As the proud father of a retarded son, that was reassuring.</P>
<P>Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller anchor the film nicely, although Diaz's Mary 
is at times a tad too gullible, even for this sort of comedy. Matt Dillon 
is adequate, while Chris Elliott delivers a creepy variant on his 
standard overconfident goon persona. The film is nicely framed by 
legendary quirk-folk singer Jonathan Richman, singing a number of inanely 
catchy tunes as the film's wandering troubadour.</P>
<P>If anything in this review offended you, skip "There's Something About 
Mary." Otherwise, get ready for some big laughs from a deeply flawed, but 
very funny over-the-top piece of comic anarchy. Either way, you have been 
warned.</P>
