<P>     Undeterred by the universally hostile reaction to her previous 
holiday picture, MIXED NUTS, director Nora Ephron (SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE) 
is back at it again this year with MICHAEL, the second angel-comes-to-
Earth feature of the month.  While this may not be quite as sweet as THE 
PREACHER'S WIFE, the central theme of redemption is essentially the 
same.  And, even though the script for MICHAEL moderates its sugary 
flavor with a dash of cynicism, it's no stretch to guess that the film 
is going for the same audience that's enchanted by such life-affirming 
classics as A CHRISTMAS CAROL and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.</P>
<P>     John Travolta, fresh from PHENOMENON and seemingly twenty pounds 
heavier, plays a grungy, chain-smoking, womanizing archangel named 
Michael.  His purpose on Earth, in this, his final mission to the 
planet, is "to restore a man's heart" by imitating Cupid.  That man is 
Frank Quinlan (William Hurt), a former reporter for the CHICAGO TRIBUNE 
who has been reduced to writing stories for the tabloid NATIONAL MIRROR.  
Along with his best friend, Huey Driscoll (Robert Pastorelli), and 
Huey's dog, Sparky, they scour the country, looking for the unusual and 
the unbelievable.  When they receive a letter from an elderly woman 
(Jean Stapleton) in Iowa claiming that she's living with an angel, the 
lure is too strong.  The MIRROR's editor, Vartan Malt (Bob Hoskins), 
sends Frank, Huey, and Sparky on assignment, along with newcomer Dorothy 
Winters (Andie MacDowell), an "angel expert." </P>
<P>     William Hurt, who never emotes much in any role, is essentially 
reprising his emotional transformation from THE DOCTOR.  He starts out 
as a cold, remote, cynical man, but, through Michael's manipulations, he 
comes to realize that he still has feelings and can love someone.  Hurt 
is excellent playing Frank before the thaw; his effectiveness diminishes 
greatly thereafter.  Andie MacDowell is dreadfully miscast as Dorothy.  
She's supposed to be uncertain and vulnerable, but MacDowell never 
successfully conveys those characteristics, nor does she give us any 
particular reason to care about her character. A more interesting and 
energetic performance is turned in by Robert Pastorelli (ERASER), who 
dutifully plays the thankless role of Hurt's sidekick. </P>
<P>     Surprisingly, Travolta, despite his top billing, stays in the 
background for most of the film.  We don't actually see his face until 
twenty minutes into the running time, and, shortly thereafter, he takes 
a back seat (literally) to the humans. Michael's good for some one 
liners, but he's all charm without much personality.  We like him 
because he's played by Travolta, not because the script gives us any 
real reason to.  In fact, when you consider it, he's little more than a 
plot device. </P>
<P>     There are times when MICHAEL seems afflicted with a split 
personality.  There's an edginess to the script that is repeatedly 
blunted by the feel-good saccharine that the Ephron sisters injected 
into their re-writes of Pete Dexter and Jim Quinlan's original 
treatment.  Bits of the original still come through -- Michael isn't the 
most sympathetic of angels, for example -- but it's in conflict with the 
film's prevalent tone.  There's a line spoken by Michael that 
illustrates the Ephrons' apparent view of life:  "You can never have too 
much sugar."</P>
<P>     Despite scenes of Travolta dancing, MacDowell singing, and Sparky 
attacking Bob Hoskins, MICHAEL is a surprisingly lifeless affair.  It's 
a little too low-key to be an effective romance and a little too soft to 
be anything more ambitious.  Ultimately, it's neither offensive nor 
horrible; it's just another unspectacular, uninspired entry on Nora 
Ephron's erratic resume.  I can't recommend MICHAEL, but it's innocuous 
enough to be watchable -- provided you can summon the enthusiasm to stay 
awake.</P>
