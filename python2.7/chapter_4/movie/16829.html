<PRE>Elizabeth</PRE>
<P>I had held myself back from seeing this prestigious film, a spicy
historical narrative on the early years of Queen Elizabeth+s reign,
because I perceived that it was going to have certain anti-Catholic
elements.  For the record, I don+t participate in industry-wide
boycotts, (nor do I condemn such), but I am sensitive in what I consider
to be personally offensive.  A critic being _offended_?  Mmm hmm.</P>
<P>But ultimately, my voice was being demanded to be heard, especially from
some close friends who (1) saw it/liked it, (2) pointed out that history
can+t be debated with.  The cheapie theatre had it playing.  The
nominations came in, and it unseated _Truman Show_.  Okay, okay, twist
my arm.</P>
<P>The movie opens with a tragic scene: three individuals, devout
Protestants, are being burned at the stake for heresy.  We don+t know
who they are.  Immediately our hearts go out to them.  Dying for
ideological differences is unheard of in the free world (but still
commonplace in Communistic and Islamic societies), and besides, they+re
praying.  And burning is gruesome.  Such is the opening point of the
film; controversial, but a sad truth.</P>
<P>For this to be the beginning, it is assumed that the film will keep the
religious element strong throughout the entirity of the film.  Not so.
The auspicous beginning is only a MacGuffin.  As the film progresses, it
loses interest in the ideological elements, and gains interest in
Elizabeth+s transformation from promiscuous lover to "virgin queen."
Violence first, and when it gets talky, switch to sex.  And back again.</P>
<P>Does that make the screenwriters unfair to Catholics?  Hmmm...  Late in
the film, another public execution occurs.  This time, three Catholics
having their heads chopped off and put on sticks.  It is clear that at
least one of them is very devout, and was in this dilemna because he
followed through with his religious convictions.  Fairness in
translation?  Not quite.</P>
<P>They were sentenced, not for heresy, but for being secretive political
adversaries of the Queen.  (Note that we don+t know if the ones killed
in the beginning had done the same).  Also, by this time we are jaded,
and the focus of the story at this juncture is far more interested in
the Queen+s personal love history than in the "deeper issues" of
ideology.  When one of the Catholic martyrs says, that they expect to be
remembered, Geoffrey Rush+s character smirks... "No they won+t."  Sadly,
he+s right.</P>
<P>This isn+t the only incident of awkward jabs where the Catholics are the
"bad guys".  They are scattered throughout, with little pricks, here and
there, as if they weren+t big enough to warrant a notice.  Take the
initial scenes at the Vatican.  You hear that ominous minor-key chord.
The rooms are dark and gloomy.  The bottom text is in Bigger letters, in
CAPS, THE VATICAN.  You see the Pope, played by John Gielgud, who+s not
Italian, and who sneers his way through the brief cameo.  Not a mention
is made about the historic changes about to occur in Trent, where a
Catholic Counter-Reformation revival was about to occur.  It is there
that reforms were made to stop the abuses that occurred in the clergy,
such as the misuses of indulgences.  But you wouldn+t know that from
this film.</P>
<P>Then there+s this Spanish friar, wearing a black garb, has a disheveled
appearance and is at times walking in slow-mo, with that same droning
minor-key chord.  Technically, this character+s only sin is that he+s
Spanish, and represents a threat to the queen that she will marry the
Spanish Duke.  And the sins of the Duke?  That he is crazy, has an
obnoxious laugh, and is a transvestite.  Yep.</P>
<P>I+ve heard Evangelical Protestants praise the film, but it does no
justice to them either.  Elizabeth+s chief aide, played by Sir Richard
Attenborough, is initially a powerful ally, but he degenerates into an
inept politician.  A nice guy, means well, but consistently making the
wrong calls.  He persuades the Queen to fight France in one scene, and
little children soldiers are killed.</P>
<P>Who+s the positive point-of-reference?  It+s not the Catholics, they+re
the ominous enemy.  Not the Protestants, they+re inept.  And not
Elizabeth.  She is totally dependent upon her aides.  The only character
who understands the fullness of the political dilemnas is Rush+s
character, a scheming, murderous, lothario.  Because he+s agnostic,
thus, not tied to any religious affiliation, he is the strongest hero in
the film.  And all Elizabeth does is rise up to the challenge of
trusting him.</P>
<P>I do not doubt that Elizabethan history has its high and low points, as
does Christian history.  But what _Elizabeth_ does is it takes all the
most campy elements of that historical period, and display it as much as
a sexual thriller as possible.  It+s the _Insider Edition_ hitting the
textbooks.</P>
<P>This is unfortunate, because there is something very deeply profound
that occurred during that period.  Elizabeth, in establishing
Anglicanism, declared perhaps the most major political and ideological
settlement in world history.  The phrase "VIA MEDIA" (In the Middle),
long the anthem for Anglicans and Episcopalians, is not uttered, not
once.  It means that the Anglicans are schisming with Papal authority,
but they are retaining the liturgy.  It means that they become Catholic
_and_ Protestant.  It is the triumph of compromise.</P>
<P>For a film that begins with the burning "heretics" at the stake, it
loses its focus.  The proper climax would be the instituting of
Anglicanism, the power of "Via Media", and the ensuing political calm.
But it doesn+t.  Instead, it shifts focus once it gets too talky, so
that when this issue is finally resolved, apathy had already settled in.
When the three Catholics are beheaded, we could care less whether they
had deep religious devotion or not.</P>
<P>I must re-emphasize: I am speaking for myself, and not for any existing
watchdog group.  If it sounds that I am reactionary, or overly
sensitive, so be it.  I recognize that art criticism is a subjective
experience, and there is no doubt that there may be devout Catholics out
there who have seen this film, and probably enjoyed it.  Subjectively
speaking, what I saw is enough for me to be lukewarm, in the worst of
ways.  The acting is great, the direction is unique, the cinemotography
is colorful... YAWN.  So what.  _Birth of a Nation_, among the most
racist movies ever made, is an artistic triumph too.</P>
