<PRE>                                MACBETH (1971)
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     Roman Polanski is a controversial, but extremely gifted director.
His best pictures (Oscar nominated for CHINATOWN and TESS) are
brilliant and some of his lessor ones (FRANTIC, BITTER MOON, and DEATH
AND THE MAIDEN) are still intriguing.  His downfall is that his roots
are in horror films (ROSEMARY'S BABY and DANCE OF THE VAMPIRE).</P>
<P>     Undoubtedly giddy with the success of his ROSEMARY'S BABY, Roman
Polanski decided to approach his next film, a Shakespearean play, in
the same manner.  With backing from Playboy Productions, his vision of
MACBETH is one of the lessor of the movies made from Shakespeare's
works.  Beside the slasher movie aspects, the film is filled with full
frontal nudity.  It even has naked boys who are gruesomely murdered.</P>
<P>     [Polanski also lost his wife to the Manson clan sometime during
this period, and I have no idea how that affected him.  MACBETH might
have been finished before then.  All I know for sure is that it was
released in 1971.]</P>
<P>     All of this notwithstanding, the major problem with the film is
that the acting is lifeless.  Yes, the shocking portions are there, but
most of the acting is remarkably devoid of energy.  Polanski's
direction serves more to confuse than to enlighten.  If you are not
already well versed in the play before you enter, you will undoubtedly
leave shaking your head and wondering "what was that all about?"</P>
<P>     Polanski's MACBETH has a traditional look.  The sets and the
costumes are quite realistic.  The squalor of that period is in full
evidence.  The castle rooms have straw beds with a roaring fire in the
middle.  Several people sleep in each room, and their big dogs sleep
with them.  From what I know of Scottish history this is all authentic.
The movie was actually filmed in Wales, but that is another story.</P>
<P>     The cinematography (Gilbert Taylor who later did STAR WARS) is
full of earthen browns.  It paints a bleak picture of the landscape.
Rather than the picture postcard look, it goes with quite a depressing
motif.</P>
<P>     Polanski has his actors think aloud many of the lines as they walk
rather than speak them.  He is no Kenneth Branagh.  He seems incapable
of imbuing in his charges the importance of enunciation.  They run
through their lines as if the dialog were of little consequence.</P>
<P>     If one of Shakespeare's purpose in the play was to shock people
with Macbeth's dastardly deeds, then Polanski's techniques are
effective.  When Macbeth (Jon Finch) murders Duncan (Nicholas Selby),
he stabs him several times with the blood spurting onto his hands and
his clothes.  He transfers the blood to the hands of his wife, Lady
Macbeth (Francesca Annis), which makes all the dialog about the blood
particularly poignant.</P>
<P>     "Do not bid me speak; see, and then speak yourselves," says
Macduff (Terence Bayler) when asked about the king's death.  As in most
sequences, the words are literate but the acting is not.  Bayler has
little screen presence which is the problem with most of actors in the
film.  Only Francesca Annis gives a mildly interesting interpretation
of a woman gone mad.</P>
<P>     Regardless of all of its flaws, this is Shakespeare, and the
language is worth the price of admission.  When Macbeth wants to beat a
fast exit, he does not say, "Let's get out of here."  Oh not,
Shakespearean prose is ever so much more elegant.  Macbeth advises,
"Let us not be dainty of our leave-taking."  Don't you wish you could
talk like that?  Don't you wish everyone would talk like that?</P>
<P>     As you hear the cold wind blowing across the barren Scottish
plain, you can feel the chill going right through your bones.</P>
<P>     Finally, I can not leave this review without mentioning the famous
scene of the witches.  So what do you think Polanski's vision of this
is?  Well, he has not just a few, but three score of witches.  He picks
them for their ugliness, no surprise there, for their enormous girth
and for their lack of teeth.  Oh yes, and he has them all strip naked
before the cameras roll.  I wish he had spent less time trying to shock
and more on practice sessions for his actors.</P>
<P>     MACBETH runs 2:20.  It is rated R for graphic violence and full
frontal nudity of women and boys.  The show would be appropriate for
mature teenagers.  Although it is full of flaws, the movie does have
lovely language and effective settings.  In the end, I can not
recommend it, but I do give it ** which is perhaps a bit more than it
deserves.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
