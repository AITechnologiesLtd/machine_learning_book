<PRE>SIX DAYS SEVEN NIGHTS
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1998 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        The most satisfying thing about "Six Days Seven Nights" is the
print ads.</P>
<P>        Harrison Ford is shown pounding through river water with his shirt
unbuttoned to the waist right there alongside Anne Heche, whose blouse is
similarly--and predictably--agape.</P>
<P>        While this might represent an equitable first in terms of a film's
publicity materials, "Six Days Seven Nights" doesn't waste much time in
pointing out--via Ford's character Quinn Harris--that Robin Monroe's
(Heche) breasts are, in fact, "too small."  The audience is in a unique
position to argue this fact given that Heche's chest is prominently on
display in the film--covered, but under such skimpy tops that one doesn't
need a copy of "Gray's Anatomy" to hand to figure out exactly what it is
we're looking at.</P>
<P>        Add to that fixation the fact that the filmmakers have written
Quinn's "assistant" Angelica (Jacqueline Obradors) as a buxom brunette who
exposes herself (back to camera, thus upholding the film's PG-13 rated
tone) to Robin's fiancé and you've got yourself a lightweight yet
singularly top-heavy movie that could have benefited from an ounce of
subtlety.</P>
<PRE>        "Six Days Seven Nights" reminds me of a t-shirt I saw once that
read "Need a place to rest your head?  How about ... MY TITS!"</PRE>
<P>        Ooh yah, broad is what we have here.  If the thought of Heche
telling Ford not to smile as he attempts to fish a snake out of her shorts
makes you smile, then perhaps this movie is for you.  They're not the worst
pairing in the world, but Bogie and Hepburn bickered a lot better in "The
African Queen" (and he never once felt her up from what I can remember).
Heck, even Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner made a mismatched duo more
deserving of an occasional chuckle in "Romancing the Stone."</P>
<P>        What's perhaps most intriguing about "Six Days Seven Nights" is
that Heche was cast shortly before going public with her romantic
involvement with "Ellen"'s Ellen DeGeneres.  The timing of this revelation
puts the on-screen chemistry between Heche and Ford under more scrutiny
than it can withstand--in the back of our minds we're all wondering what
Indiana Jones is doing running around in the jungles of Macataya with
Hollywood's latest lesbian.</P>
<PRE>        Not that there's anything wrong with that...</PRE>
<P>        "Forced" is probably the best word to sum up "Six Days Seven
Nights."  The slightly neurotic New York glamour mag editor and her beau
(David Schwimmer) on a week's vacation in the South Pacific.  The grizzled,
middle-aged pilot who likes his life on the simple side.  The emergency
photo shoot that puts the two of them on a short plane hop to Tahiti
together (can you think of *any* reason why the David Schwimmer character
would have stayed behind?).  The storm.  The forced landing.  The broken
landing gear.  The realization that they're going to be stuck on this
island paradise for quite some time now and had better learn to get along.
The wacky adventures with wild animals, pirates, and a "but I thought you
were dead, honey!" boyfriend.  Etc.</P>
<PRE>        Six Days.  Seven Nights.  Eight dollars wasted.</PRE>
