<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   Judging by what made it to the screen in OCTOBER SKY, it quickly
   becomes clear why Universal greenlighted a film based on the memoir
   of NASA engineer Homer H. Hickam Jr. -- if we're to believe the
   events depicted in the picture, his story as an ambitious adolescent
   trapped in a dying West Virginia coal mining town plays exactly like
   a Hollywood movie.  Other than a few touches (I can envision studio
   executives pensively musing "Now, does he *have* to be named Homer
   Hickam?"), this tale of a teenager struggling against adversity
   adheres to the conventional inspirational drama formula so closely
   that the "Based On A True Story" opening title card seems as much of
   a shield against skepticism as it does a selling point.</P>
<P>   In today's market, this modest film feels like a throwback: an
   unabashedly earnest, clean-cut bit of storytelling which reveals its
   colours as surely as the movie's teacher will gently chide students
   mercilessly teasing the resident science kid by drawling "He's right,
   y'all."  Set in 1957 in the relatively-isolated town of Coalwood, the
   picture follows the story of Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal), a teen
   who becomes inspired by the launch of Russia's Sputnik satellite and
   starts to build his own rockets, enlisting the help of friends Roy
   Lee (William Lee Scott), O'Dell (Chad Lindberg), and math whiz
   Quentin (Chris Owen).  Coalwood is a mining town through and through,
   where the only visible means of escape is via a football scholarship
   like Homer's older brother Jim (Scott Miles); everybody else is
   relegated to an unpromising life down in the mines.  While Homer's
   dreams are buoyed by his supportive teacher Miss Riley (Laura Dern),
   who suggests that competing in the regional science fair may net
   college scholarships and a way out for the rocket boys, he's
   dissuaded and disparaged at every turn by his stern father John
   (Chris Cooper), who tidily happens to be the town's mine supervisor
   and considers Homer's ambitions to be foolhardy.</P>
<P>   While director Joe Johnston employs frequent usage of the easy
   contrast between Homer's skyward aspirations and the gloomy depths of
   the mine, he also diffuses the grimy claustrophobia of the depressed
   milieu with the old-fashioned wholesomeness of the community; this is
   a place where a girl can scamper up to our young hero, bat her eyes,
   and sigh "Golly, Homer, it sure was exciting watching your rockets go
   up!" without any ironic or tongue-in-cheek connotations.  If the
   period dress and liberal use of archetypes wasn't enough to remove
   any residual doubt of its aim to depict an ostensibly simpler, more
   innocent time, the film lazily establishes the era by deluging the
   soundtrack with wall-to-wall classic rock 'n' roll.  (A montage of
   comic misfires is unimaginatively set to "Ain't That A Shame?")</P>
<P>   Although the utterly pedestrian OCTOBER SKY is a textbook example of
   cookie-cutter filmmaking, there's nothing much to really fault with
   Mr. Johnston's workmanlike helming or the sincere, capable
   performance of young lead Mr. Gyllenhall, but it's all so generic
   that it's easy to resist.  The story's trajectory is so unwaveringly
   apparent that there's no sense of wonder to accompany the shots of
   characters gaping at their amateur rocket blasts, and the film is
   riddled with such cardboard stereotypes and typecasting that I found
   it difficult to invest much emotion in their plights.  Just when John
   seems ready to cross the line from strict authoritarian to unfeeling
   tyrant, you can count on him to reaffirm his gruffly loving nature by
   performing a good deed, and as helpful teacher Miss Riley, Ms. Dern
   so earnestly strains to light a fire under her students that I
   expected her to pull a facial muscle.  While the picture is
   reasonably pleasant, it's narratively stupefying -- a shot of a
   disgusted John throwing a spent rocket into the trash is a given, and
   it's inevitable that an oft-mentioned legendary outsider makes a
   fleeting appearance -- and the syrupy score by Mark Isham
   condescendingly serves as an emotional guide for the audience.
   Ironically, for a picture about a boy whose hard work and ambitions
   sent him shooting for the stars, OCTOBER SKY is depressingly
   unambitious.  For all its good intentions, it's telling that the home
   video footage which closes the picture is infinitely more touching
   and awe-inspiring than the preceding hundred-odd minutes of
   celluloid.</P>
