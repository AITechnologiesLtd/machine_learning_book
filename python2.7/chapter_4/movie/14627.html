<P>When trying to determine how best to describe "Clay Pigeons," the image 
of a Dennis Miller performance comes to mind. Generally, Miller makes his 
stage entrance displaying supreme confidence, half ambling and half 
swaggering his way to the microphone. Then he lets rip with a torrent of 
dazzling verbal creativity. Adroitly juggling observations and 
indictments, with accents from his vast personal warehouse of arcane pop 
references, Miller's presentation style announces "I'm smart, hip and 
right, and so are you, if you're able to keep up with me." </P>
<P>After a few minutes of watching Miller, though, you begin to notice other 
things. He's extremely mannered, without a hint of spontaneity. He's self 
satisfied and arrogant. And, beneath his exalted moral righteousness, 
he's often just as mean as the villains against which he rails so 
mightily. Typically, Miller ends his rants by saying "Or maybe it's just 
me," but he's only being facetious, using the catch-phrase as an easy way 
to wrap up the show. As much as I enjoy Dennis Miller, his performances 
usually leave me with a bad taste in my mouth.</P>
<P>Which brings us to "Clay Pigeons." This darkly humorous tale about murder 
in a small Montana town starts off with a knockout punch, daring to take 
a classic film noir storyline and place it outdoors in bright sunlight. 
Combining bold camerawork, brazen situations and a terrific soundtrack, 
the film quickly establishes its stance as smart and hip, aiming for that 
post-modern cinematic playground occupied by the likes of the Coen 
brothers.</P>
<P>It all rolls along smoothly for a while, but then you begin to notice 
things. When a woman gets backhanded early in the story, the filmmakers 
make sure we understand that she deserved it. Later, a woman gets stabbed 
to death in a scene filmed so stylishly that the violence seems almost 
pornographic. Like most noir thrillers, our hero is a hapless type whose 
poor judgment lands him in a heap of trouble, but these filmmakers 
clearly have far more affection for the villain than the victims. 
Ultimately, this mannered, disdainful work rewards viewers with an lazy 
ending and a bitter aftertaste.</P>
<P>The story begins when Clay Bidwell (Joaquin Phoenix) goes out shooting 
with his best friend Earl (Gregory Sporleder). In a burst of emotion, 
Earl angrily informs Clay that he's aware of his friend's ongoing affair 
with his wife, Amanda (Georgina Cates). Abruptly, Earl turns the gun on 
himself, intending to exact revenge by framing Clay for his "murder." A 
stunned Clay disposes of Earl's body and tries to break off contact with 
Amanda, but the sultry widow, totally unfazed by her husband's death, is 
determined to continue the affair. When Clay resists her advances and 
takes up with another woman, he soon finds himself with an additional 
corpse to dispose of. </P>
<P>In-between fatalities, Clay makes friends with the charismatic Lester 
Long (Vince Vaughn), a drifter hanging around the sleepy Montana town. 
They take off for a fishing trip on the lake where Clay dumped corpse 
number two and, to the ominous strains of "Dueling Banjos" from the film 
"Deliverance," a body rises from the murky depths. Enter the FBI, led by 
bright-eyed, sharp-tongued agent Dale Shelby (Janeane Garofalo), on the 
trail of a serial killer who specializes in women. Suddenly, Clay finds 
himself the prime suspect in a string of murders. </P>
<P>In addition to its clever presentation style, "Clay Pigeons" boasts a 
number of stand-out performances. Vince Vaughn is electric as Lester Long,
 an imposing figure comfortable even when striding in public wearing only 
his briefs. Lester is a man who leans in a little too close while talking 
and relishes being overly familiar with anyone he meets. You'll remember 
him and his nervous giggle long after leaving the theater.</P>
<P>Janeane Garofalo is wonderful as the caustic, but deeply humane Agent 
Shelby, brightening the grim proceedings with her understated wit. Phil 
Morris is effective as her stoic co-worker, a man of few words whose 
facial expressions more than make up for his relative silence, and Scott 
Wilson (one of the killers from "In Cold Blood") scores as the laconic 
Sheriff Mooney. In the lead role, Joaquin Phoenix is adequate, if overly 
flat in his delivery. </P>
<P>After a great beginning, "Clay Pigeons" grows more forced with each new 
outlandish twist, as the film's carefully crafted tension slowly unravels.
 The story eventually sputters to an unsatisfying end with a denouement 
that feels perfunctory at best.</P>
<P>The bottom line is that sadism and death are punchlines in "Clay Pigeons" 
and we're expected to play along, else we jeopardize our status as smart, 
hip filmgoers. While the production offers sharply drawn characters, a 
powerhouse cast, some great deadpan one-liners, exceptional music and 
robust visuals, there is an underlying nastiness that becomes 
increasingly difficult to tolerate as the film goes on. "Clay Pigeons" is 
hip at the expense of its humanity, and that's more nihilism than I'm 
willing to embrace.</P>
