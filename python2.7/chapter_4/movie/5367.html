                       A film review by Randy Parker

<PRE>(Review written in 1992)</PRE>
<P>        When I arrived in Paris in June, 1992, I was surprised to find
France plastered with posters TWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME, since the
movie wasn't scheduled to open in the U.S. until late August.  Happily, the
film--the prequel to David Lynch's cult television series--was playing in a
fancy, THX theater.  Unfortunately, the theater was far more impressive
than the movie, which absolutely stinks, much like a French lavatory.
Worse, actually.</P>
<P>        FIRE WALK WITH ME (directed by Lynch) will be completely
incomprehensible to anyone who has not seen the TV series or read "Laura
Palmer's Secret Diary."  For "Twin Peaks" junkies, like me, the movie is
only marginally improved.  The plot is jumbled and illogical, not to
mention excruciatingly sluggish.  The first 30 minutes, which have almost
nothing to do with the main story line, feature Chris Isaak and Kiefer
Sutherland as FBI agents investigating a murder in Portland, Oregon.  The
movie then stops in Philadelphia for a nonsensical cameo by David Bowie and
a BRIEF appearance by Kyle MacLachlan as Dale Cooper.  Lynch then drops
this plot strand altogether and abruptly shifts the setting to Twin Peaks,
Washington--one year later.</P>
<P>        Ah, Twin Peaks: "familiar territory," you think to yourself as
Angelo Badalamenti's distinctive musical score chimes in.  Wrong!  The
movie proves that you really can't go home again, or at least Lynch can't.
Only about a quarter of the characters from the TV series appear in the
movie: Leland Palmer, Bobby Briggs, James, Shelly, Leo, the log lady and a
few others--mostly in meaningless cameos.  The rest of the "Twin Peaks"
cast is nowhere to be seen, and consequently, Lynch fails to recreate the
spirit and flavor of TV's most enigmatic town.  Cast members Michael
Ontkean, Sherilyn Fenn, Piper Laurie, and Richard Beymer are sorely missed,
not to mention Lara Flynn Boyle, who has been replaced by lackluster Moira
Kelly in the crucial role of Donna.</P>
<P>        The movie concentrates solely on Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) as she
suffers through drug abuse, prostitution, and incest, during her miserable
last seven days on Earth.  The night of Laura's death, which is truly
terrifying, is the film's only remotely effective sequence.  We finally get
to see exactly what happened to Laura after she jumped off James'
motorcycle and ran into the woods at that lonely traffic light in the
middle of nowhere.  Her murder unfolds just as Agent Cooper reconstructed
it in the TV series, which is gratifying for faithful "Twin Peaks" viewers.
But it's an awfully small reward for sitting through a painfully awful
movie.</P>
