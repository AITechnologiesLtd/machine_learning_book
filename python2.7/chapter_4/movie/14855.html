Starring Cast: Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon, Ben Stiller</P>
<P>I didn't expect this to happen, but I finally saw THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT
MARY and I really don't have too much to say about it. I figured that
either I would be extremely grossed out and offended, or I would find it
hysterically funny, or both. Instead, I found myself feeling strangely
indifferent to the whole thing. Yes, it's gross, and yes, it's funny, but
it's nothing to write home about on either count.</P>
<P>This may be partly a result of the fact that others had told me about the
most, uh, unusual jokes before I saw the movie, and therefore the shock
factor was diluted. The movie is, in fact, a lot more explicit with vulgar
sight gags than most comedies. But since I had been told, for example, that
Ben Stiller would have a slight...mishap, shall we say, when zipping up his
pants, I pretty much knew what was going to happen as soon as he walked
into the bathroom. The same goes for another disgusting scene in which
Cameron Diaz's character rubs some gel in her hair that, well, isn't
actually gel: I knew the joke was coming a good three minutes ahead of time.</P>
<P>A lot of the jokes are equally tasteless. Some of them, particularly those
involving a dog on speed, are pretty funny, some of them start to make the
audience uncomfortable with such questionable tactics as making fun of the
mentally and physically handicapped (though this wasn't played nearly as
offensively as I was afraid it might be), and some, such as a guy who walks
around with a grotesque skin condition the whole time, are just dumb and
pointless. By and large, the funniest jokes are the ones that just aim for
plain weirdness without worrying about being gross, such as when a
hitchhiker explains that he plans to make money by producing a seven minute
abs training video (thereby cutting into the "Eight-Minute Abs" video
market).</P>
<P>Surprisingly enough, one of the strengths of THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT
MARY is that the story, in which Ted (Ben Stiller) tries to ingratiate
himself to Mary (Cameron Diaz), for whom he has carried a torch for
thirteen years, is handled reasonably well and actually has us rooting for
Ted and Mary by the end. Among the obstacles are four other men, (including
a P.I. Ted had originally hired to find her, since they'd lost touch after
high school), and all of whom go to ridiculous lengths of deception to
impress Mary. It's fairly easy to understand why, as Mary spends much of
her time caring for her handicapped brother and generally seems to be most
good-natured person on the face of the planet. There's a fairly complex web
of lies and fake identities involved in all this, and I was pleasantly
surprised at how well the Farrellys kept it all together and the clever,
composed manner in which it all becomes clear.</P>
<P>THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY has been hyped largely as a gross-out comedy
in the tradition of John Waters, but to me it seemed more like a romantic
comedy, only with gags that are much more low-brow and bizarre than what
you'd normally see. As such, it's reasonably entertaining, but it's not the
love-it-or-hate-it spectacle that I had expected, and in the end it's
actually one of my more forgettable cinematic experiences of the year.</P>
