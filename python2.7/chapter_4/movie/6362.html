<P>     Al Pacino's labor-of-love documentary about William Shakespeare's
"Richard III" is delightful for, oh, about an hour.  Maybe less.
Pacino, desperate to communicate his love for the Bard, takes his camera
anywhere and everywhere, from the halls of academia right down to the
man on the street.  (In one memorable clip, a homeless man expresses
regret for the loss of feelings behind contemporary language.) Pacino
stages readings and rehearsals and, even, the occasional educational
aside.  (He provides an answer to "what is iambic pentameter?") For a
while, the whole thing is fascinating, funny, and even frank, as when
the many interviewed actors admit the brutal truths about speaking,
hearing, and understanding Bill S.  Unfortunately, when Al gets down to
the business of actually *staging* some scenes, LOOKING FOR RICHARD
begins to look lost.  Almost all of the serious stuff is filmed in that
same loose and leisurely style, which is great for capturing comments,
but not so hot when trying to do drama.  Of the costumed performers,
only two of the actors-- Estelle Parsons and Penelope Allen-- produce
any real fire.  The rest are a bit of a bore, including Al.  </P>
