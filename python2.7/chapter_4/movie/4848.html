Directed by Ted Demme.  Rated R.</P>
<P>     When the lights dimmed and the first few minutes of
Beautiful Girls started rolling, my immediate reaction was to
roll my eyes in dismay.  "Oy," I thought to myself.  "A bunch of
dudes talking to each other about their feelings and
relationships and why they can't commit.  It's a chick movie for
guys.  God help us.  Why don't they shut up about their feelings
and go shoot something?  It'd be much more entertaining."
     But then I gave myself a good, hard mental slap in the face
for being such a typical boneheaded American.  I mean, I gripe
all the time about gender stereotyping in movies and how the
media macho myth cripples men emotionally.  Why should I complain
when a movie seems to be undercutting that myth?  So I sat back
and did my best to give Beautiful Girls a chance.
     My final assessment:  Nice try.  Not a particularly
successful one attempt, but an interesting and apparently
heartfelt one.  The writing is well-meaning but often clumsy,
with characters dropping into long overwritten speeches about The
Meaning Of Life And True Love And Stuff at the drop of a hat. 
And while the performances are earnest and sweet, they lack the
sparkle, the elusive sketching-a-character-in-a-few-short-lines
quality, that's needed to make an ensemble film shine.
     But it is a genuinely nice try.  And more to the point, it
has some interesting things to say about men and men's sexuality. 
Unlike the traditional chick movie, a genre that tends to skewer
men's foibles mercilessly (an understandable exercise and one
I've been known to indulge in myself on occasion), Beautiful
Girls deals with men's foibles from the men's point of view.  It
questions, even mocks, traditional male attitudes towards sex and
love and relationships; but it does so gently, with understanding
and sympathy and good humor.
     Essentially, it's--well, it's a chick movie for guys.  (As
such, it will most likely drop at the box office like a sixteen-
ton weight, so if you're at all interested in seeing it, I
suggest you do so as soon as possible.)
     The story focuses on bunch of guys from a small town in
Massachusetts approaching their tenth high school reunion.  One
of them, Willie (Timothy Hutton) has managed to get out of town
and is struggling to make it as a piano player in New York City;
he's now back for the reunion, to connect with his old friends
and try to make some decisions about his life.  Most of the guys
still live in town, though; they plow snow for a living, hang
out, drink, fight with their girlfriends, try to pick up cute
women, and belt out "Sweet Caroline" in the local bar.
     And they talk.  They talk about sex, they talk about love,
they talk about relationships.  They talk about women; about
their wives and girlfriends and exes, about porn stars and
supermodels and girls they had crushes on in high school.  They
talk about what they want from women and what they think women
want from them.  They talk in a way that guys in movies rarely
talk to each other; showing their awkwardness and fear, their
passion for sex and their disappointment in it and their worry
that the disappointment is somehow their fault, their longing for
something better than what they've got and their anxiety that
they don't have what it takes to make that happen.  And when they
talk, they show a balance between toughness and vulnerability,
swagger and doubt, that has an uncommon feeling of truth to it.
     Now obviously, I don't have any idea whether guys really
talk to each other like this when women aren't around.  (Any guys
who see the movie and feel like clueing me in as to its
verisimilitude, feel free to drop me a line.)  But the dialogue
does have a ring of truth to it.  The style isn't always the most
authentic; much of the language is speechy and poetical and not
very much like the way people really talk.  But the feeling
behind the words, the sentiments driving the sometimes dippy and
flowery speeches, do feel quite real.
     Now, just the very sight of men talking to each other about
love, and talking about it as if it matters to them, is enough to
make this movie stand out in a crowd.  But it isn't just the
sight of men talking with each other about their personal lives
that makes this movie unusual.  A number of the specific things
that they say about their lives, and particularly that they say
about sex and love, are things that I've rarely heard before from
guys in Movieland.
     For instance.  When Paul (Michael Rapaport), who is sort of
the movie's scapegoat/whipping boy, complains that his girlfriend
Jan (Martha Plimpton) is pressuring him into making a commitment,
the other guys rag on him mercilessly, pointing out that he's
been with her for seven years and a commitment is not an
unreasonable thing to expect.  When Tommy (Matt Dillon) gripes
about his girlfriend Sharon (Mira Sorvino) and her insecurity and
shitty self-esteem (not to mention her bulimia), his buddies
point out rather bluntly that his ongoing affair with his old
girlfriend Darian (Lauren Holly) might have something to do with
it.  When Paul gasses on about how terrific supermodels are, how
they represent promise and hope and how he wants to date one more
than anything, the guys roll their eyes in mock despair at his
obsessive evasion of real-life women and real-life relationships. 
And when Willie describes his lovely and talented lover Tracy
(Annabeth Gish) to his pals, they read him the riot act for
waffling about his relationship and sniffing around other doors
looking for something better.  I can't remember the last time I
saw a movie in which the male characters encouraged one another
to take some responsibility for their emotional lives.  It's
quite refreshing.
     But I don't want to get too carried away here, either. 
There are a number of traditional notions about sex and love that
the movie doesn't question at all, and they're ones that I find
particularly annoying.
     The first has to do with the whole idea of marriage and
relationships and commitment.  Yes, it's certainly a refreshing
change of pace to see male characters taking love seriously and
talking to each other about their emotional lives.  But it's not
such a refreshing change of pace to see marriage and monogamy and
Long Term Relationships presented as the ultimate answer to all
these knotty problems of sex and love and intimacy and fear.
     And Beautiful Girls does exactly that.  Although each of the
guys in the movie has a different problem with sex and love, they
all wind up with the same solution:  It's time to settle down. 
The big winners in the movie are the guys who decide to put away
childish things, stick with their women and make The Commitment;
the big loser, Paul, is the guy who realizes just how valuable
his girl is after it's too late and he's lost her for good.  I'm
not saying that Committed Relationships are a bad idea, you
understand.  I'm just saying that a slightly less preachy tone
about it might have been nice.
     The other big problem I have with Beautiful Girls has to
with how the movie sees female beauty, what kind of girls it
perceives to be beautiful.  The wives and the girlfriends and the
objects of desire are all very traditionally attractive in a very
standard Hollywood way; slender and willowy and feminine, with
gym-toned bodies and flat stomachs.  And in a stunningly
unoriginal bit of casting, Uma Thurman plays Andera, the
stunningly beautiful stranger who sweeps into town and knocks all
the men off their fee.  Uma, not surprisingly, is held up as the
ultimate pinnacle of female beauty, the one that all the men
naturally and rightly desire.  The movie repeatedly pokes fun at
men for coveting supermodels and other unreal ideals of female
attractiveness; but although it pokes fun at those ideals, it
nevertheless manages to perpetuate them.  And it perpetuates the
notion that these ideals are based on some sort of objective
truth that all men can and do agree on.
     Now, I will admit wholeheartedly that this is a very
personal grudge I carry against movies in general.  I get real
tired of seeing the same damn female body over and over again
when I go to the movies.  It's not that I don't like tall thin
women; it's just that a little variety now and then would be
nice.  And in the clit-hardening department, Uma Thurman does
just about nothing for me.  I'm a bit tired of seeing her held up
as the reigning sex goddess, and I'm real tired of seeing her
bony body put forth as the ne plus ultra of female sexuality. 
Especially when there's a babe like Rosie O'Donnell on the same
screen.
     Again, I will admit to a bias.  I think Rosie is just about
the hottest woman in the movies today.  I'd do her in a New York
minute, no questions asked.  And it baffles and enrages me to see
her, time and time again, playing the buddy or the best friend,
never getting sex or love simply because she's big.  With the
exception of Exit to Eden, I don't think I've *ever* seen Rosie
O'Donnell presented as the object of anyone's desire--and it
pisses me off.  Every other woman in this movie has a boyfriend
or husband or lover; the guys may be jerks, but they're there. 
You think Rosie O'Donnell has a boyfriend?  You think anyone man
in the movie even considers Rosie O'Donnell as girlfriend
material?  Think again.  She gets lots of smart funny lines, and
she gets to make a very groovy speech about the unrealistic
standards of beauty that so many men hold women to.  What she
doesn't get is laid.  And like so many other Hollywood movies,
Beautiful Girls treats the big woman not getting laid as a
completely understandable and indisputable fact of life.  In a
movie that supposedly questions the concepts of traditional
American masculinity, I find the things that it doesn't question
at all to be very revealing.
