<P>Lethal Weapon 4 (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>>From the moment its rush production was announced, media and industry
pundits immediately pegged _Lethal_Weapon_4_ as a disaster waiting to
happen.  What these naysayers had forgotten was that the _Lethal_ series is
not one of the most successful action franchises in film history for
nothing, delivering all the requisite slam-bang thrills with appealing
actors and a generous dose of humor.  The _Lethal_s have a set formula, to
be certain, but even in this fourth go-round, the magic and charm is
definitely still there.</P>
<P>One of the reasons some had doubts about _Lethal_4_ is a bloated cast,
which had sunk last year's fourth entry in another successful Warner Bros.
franchise, the _Batman_ series.  And though the ongoing cast additions that
have characterized the _Lethal_ series have proven successful in previous
installments, on paper, it appeared that the core had reached critical mass
in _Lethal_4_.  The original's odd couple cop duo of wild and wacky Martin
Riggs (Mel Gibson) and straightlaced family man Roger Murtaugh (Danny
Glover) successfully became a trio with the addition of motormouthed money
launderer Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) in _Lethal_2_; that three made an improbably
seamless transition to four with _Lethal_3_'s introduction of daredevil
Internal Affairs officer Lorna Cole (Rene Russo), the female "lethal
weapon."  To bring the core ensemble to five is a highly
risky and impractical proposition, but screenwriter Channing Gibson
(working from a story by Jonathan Lemkin, Alfred Gough, and Miles Millar)
and series director Richard Donner decided to add wet-behind-the-ears cop
Lee Butters (Chris Rock) into the mix.  Initially, the strain of
accommodating a large ensemble shows.  After an entertaining
curtain-raising action scene involving Riggs and Murtaugh's encounter with
a flamethrower-wielding maniac comes the lengthy
introductions/reintroductions of the rest of the cast: not only Leo, Lorna,
and Butters, but also those who have lingered in the background throughout
the entire series: police captain Ed Murphy (Steve Kahan), police
psychologist Stephanie Woods (Mary Ellen Trainor), Murtaugh's wife Trish
(Darlene Love), their daughters Rianne (Traci Wolfe) and Carrie (Ebonie
Smith), and son Nick (Damon Hines).</P>
<P>However, what could have easily become tedious for fans of the series and
even newcomers is made enjoyable by what has become one of the _Lethal_
series' trademarks: humor (it is ironic that the rather dark Shane
Black-penned original, in which Riggs was despondent and suicidal,
gradually evolved into an action comedy series).  The seemingly misguided
addition of Butters also proves to be a fairly effective one.  Known to
everyone except Murtaugh, Butters is the father of Rianne's unborn child
_and_ her secret husband, which creates some predictable but no less funny
comedy of misunderstanding (Murtaugh interprets Butters's attention and
devotion to be something a bit deeper).  Butters's most notable
contribution, though, is serving as a formidable F-word-sparring partner
for Leo, whose new occupation as a private investigator (!) more
comfortably works him into the story than his real estate agent status in
_Lethal_3_.</P>
<P>So what exactly _is_ the story?  After our intrepid detective duo,
both now promoted to the rank of captain (a plot thread that doesn't
particularly lead anywhere), along with Leo, stumble upon a shipload of
illegal Chinese immigrants, they find out about a dastardly plan
orchestrated by an Asian Triad leader (Hong Kong action legend Jet Li,
making his American debut).  That's pretty much it, but the lack of story
is more than compensated by the presence of a terrific villain, the absence
of which was _Lethal 3_'s biggest problem.  Though his work here isn't
quite at the level as that of his Hong Kong works such as the
_Once_Upon_a_Time_in_China_ series, Li's high-flying martial arts
(choreographed by, among others, HK film director Corey Yuen) displays are
simply astounding, and he pulls of the none-too-easy task of stealing the
show; if
Li's ecstatic crowd reaction at the preview screening is any indication, he
will become an immediate audience favorite, paving the way for a bright
Hollywood future.</P>
<P>With such a large cast, someone is bound to get short shrift, and the
victim here, unfortunately, is Russo.  Lorna was by far _Lethal_3_'s most
inspired element, a Riggs love interest that was every bit his equal.  This
time around, however, Lorna is just about cleansed of the machisma that
made her so popular.  In a simply dumb move, the writing crew knocked her
up with Riggs's child, thus removing her from nearly all of the action.
Although she is given one (way too brief) fight scene, in effect she is
made into what Patsy Kensit played in _Lethal_2_--a token "girl" for Riggs.
 Lorna is never more sorely missed than in the climax; although Butters is
an amusing character, he doesn't click nearly as well as the third partner
because he doesn't quite hold his own in the action scenes.</P>
<P>Despite its flaws, what sells _Lethal_Weapon_4_ is the action, and
between a spectacular midfilm freeway chase to Li's amazing acrobatics, it
is definitely the thrill ride to beat this summer.  The film closes with a
photo album montage of cast and crew photos culled from all four _Lethal_s,
almost as if to close the book on the series.  But if Donner and company
can keep the _Lethal_ films as fun as all four have been, then there will
be plenty more images to add to the album in the future.  As the film's
final line goes, "We're family," and after four wildly exciting
entertainments, audiences will feel (if they don't already)
the same way about these characters and will want to return to them in the
years to come.</P>
