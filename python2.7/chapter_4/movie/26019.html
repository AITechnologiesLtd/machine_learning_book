<P>Hmmmm...seems like a couple of strange career moves on the part of Keanu
Reeves. One summer after starring in one of the freshest new films of the
past few years, THE MATRIX, Keanu returns with two very humdrum roles in two
very humdrum movies. I mention this only because even before THE MATRIX,
Keanu generally seemed to be choosing scripts that were a little "skewed",
if you know what I mean. But much like their titles, THE REPLACEMENTS and
THE WATCHER have both proven themselves to be two very generic films. Maybe
he's just saving himself up for those MATRIX sequels, eh?</P>
<P>PLOT:
Another nutty serial killer is on the loose. Another FBI agent is chasing
him down with no luck. That is until the serial killer decides to make a
game out of his killings and send pictures of his next victim to the agent
24 hours before he commits each murder. That way, the Feds have a whole day
to locate and save his next target.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A serviceable serial killer thriller that actually improves as it moves
along but ultimately can't escape the pool of basic contrivances in which it
wades. The movie starts a little slow, establishing a sorted background on
both the killer and the agent bent on apprehending him early on, but does so
with a particularly annoying overemphasis on style, in my opinion. The
director takes slo-mo and strobe effects to a new level here and doesn't
really add much to the film with either effect. In fact, I found most of his
"stylish" endeavors to be quite distracting and would have rather seen a
more straightforward approach to the movie. The "Reeves" factor, with Keanu
taking a stab at the "bad guy" role, was actually much better than I
expected. We all have to admire Reeves for at least trying to stretch his
acting abilities with this part, but I suspect that his character would have
benefited greatly from a change of appearance from the typical "Keanu" look.
Don't get me wrong, overall I thought that he gave a pretty credible
performance, but at some point these super-star actors have to recognize
that their familiarity could well take away from their characters' full
potential. In this case, a goatee, a beard, bleached hair or anything
different might've added that little "something" to his overall performance.
But enough about Keanu.</P>
<P>The story of this film is pretty standard in the serial killer genre. The
murderer who insists on giving his burnt out tracker clues with the hopes of
making a "game" out of his killing spree. I never really understood why they
do that, but whatever! The action is also pretty standard, with one basic
car chase but a surprisingly few decent moments of suspense. I also enjoyed
the background development on the James Spader character, despite the
overuse of flashbacks to do so, but didn't get enough out of the bad guy's
motivations. All we know is that he's nuts and likes to kill? Pretty weak.
But the film certainly doesn't suffer from any major plot holes, and does
give us a nice deliberation between the two men sometime near the end of the
film, with another solid performance from underrated actor James Spader. Now
I'm not exactly sure where Marisa Tomei was for the past few years or why
she chose to take this very bittie part after all that time, but for what
she had to do...I guess she was alright in the movie. Overall, like many of
this year's other films, this movie doesn't really bring anything fresh or
innovative to the genre, but does present us with an "okay" time for an hour
and a half.</P>
