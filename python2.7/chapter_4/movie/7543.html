                       A film review by John Bauer

<PRE>***1/2 (out of 4)</PRE>
<P>[Note:  After claiming otherwise, my appetite was indeed whetted by Kenneth
Branagh's HAMLET to search out other attempts to translate Shakespeare to
film in hopes of finding a better mousetrap.  As it happens, it didn't take
long.]</P>
<P>Is there a more romantic director than Franco Zeffirelli?  Known mainly to
American audiences as the man behind 1968's ROMEO AND JULIET (required
viewing for many high schoolers, and as much as most ever learn of
Shakespeare), he is also a favorite at the Metropolitan Opera, where his
achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion of many a Puccini
aria.  Last year he gave us his beautifully realized version of JANE EYRE,
one of the twin peaks (with WUTHERING HEIGHTS) of romantic literature.</P>
<P>It might seem peculiar, then, that Zeffirelli ever had an interest in
translating HAMLET for the screen.  At first blush, HAMLET is far removed
from romance.  The hero, though a prince, is depressed, conflicted and
confused.  The ostensible love interest gets little screen time, and her
scenes with her prince are usually as an object of mockery.  The plot is full
of political intrigue and the players are as cursed as the House of Atreus.</P>
<P>It is Zeffirelli's genius, however, that he is able to expose the romantic
core of HAMLET and give the sometimes dry tale an emotional embrace.  In this
Italian master's hands, romance is everywhere -- in a son's worship of his
father, in the bonds of deepest friendship, in the private thoughts of young
lovers, even in the mystery of castles by the sea.  After all, the story
hinges on a ghost, and what could be more romantic than that?</P>
<P>What seemed like a cheap way to sell tickets at the time turned out to be one
of the most romantic gestures of all, namely, hiring then-reigning Hollywood
hunk Mel Gibson to play the lead.  Who could believe that the man who made
his mark playing Mad Max and a "lethal weapon" (in the series of the same
name) would have the skill to succeed in the most famous role in the English
language?  Franco Zeffirelli, that's who.  And it is apparent in every frame
that his instinct was right on the money.</P>
<P>What Gibson brings to the role is a naturalness and ease which makes the
whole story meaningful, not to mention comprehensible.  His line readings
sound spontaneous rather than rehearsed.  His movements and gestures
(excepting his sometimes too active eyes) are totally in keeping with the
character.  This is a Hamlet whose pain we feel, whose struggle we empathize
with, and whose death we mourn as sincerely as Horatio at film's end.</P>
<P>Glenn Close, the other big name in the production, also does well by the
script and satisfies as Hamlet's mother, Gertrude -- though I must confess
I'm still trying to understand the character as written.  (Zeffirelli's
incestuous interpretation of Hamlet's relationship with his mother doesn't
help.)  Alan Bates makes a believably evil Claudius without resorting to the
mannerisms of a Hollywood heavy.  By and large the rest of the cast performs
admirably and comfortably.</P>
<P>Of special note are the cinematography by David Watkin and the score by Ennio
Morricone.  Both support the realistic mood marvelously (as do the sets and
costumes), without any overstated effects that declare "this is important;
this is Shakespeare!"  I particularly appreciate that the words are often
spoken without any music at all:  the melody of a wonderfully wrought phrase
is given its due.</P>
<P>Perhaps it is difficult to call edited Shakespeare "definitive."  And there
are certainly quite a few other filmed versions of HAMLET that I have not
seen.  But if you've ever felt the urge to overcome your fear of the Bard,
this HAMLET is an excellent place to start.</P>
