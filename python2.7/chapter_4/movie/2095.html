<P>     JACQUOT is a tribute from one lover to another, a project that
started out as a collaboration but became a both an homage and a means
of saying farewell.</P>
<P>     French film maker Jacques Demy (who is best known for his
surrealistic, often-offbeat musicals) died in October 1990, when
production on JACQUOT was nearing an end.  A filmed chronicle of Demy's
childhood memoirs put together by Agnes Varda, his companion of more
than thirty years, JACQUOT (the title refers to the young Jacques'
nickname) is a look at how the influences of childhood steer a man's
creative spirit.  During the course of the film, we meet Demy and his
friends and family, see his love for the cinema, and observe his first
attempts at creating.</P>
<P>     JACQUOT succeeds in engaging the intellect, but is less triumphant
in touching the emotions.  Despite the detail and care with which
Demy's memories have been committed to film, there is a quality about
them that distances the audience.  We understand his desires, needs,
and the everyday difficulties of his life, but little about this film
is stirring.  For all that the story is about Jacquot, there's a
question of how much of the inner person we get to know.  The film
seems more concerned with presentation than identification.</P>
<P>     The most intriguing and enjoyable parts of the movie are, by far,
those that deal with the young Demy's early forays into movie-making.
A fair amount of time is spent chronicling the development of a couple
of animated shorts that Jacquot shows to his family in a home-made
theater.  In these scenes, we are given a peek at the creative genius
of Demy, and it is through them that JACQUOT attains its goal.</P>
<P>     It's always difficult to film someone else's memories without
either missing the mark entirely or waxing nostalgic.  JACQUOT falls
into both traps at times, even as it occasionally hits the mark.  Some
of the most historically important incidents, such as the Nazi
occupation of France and the subsequent bombing raids, fail to bring
out the horror and fear that Demy must have felt.  The truest moments
are often those that seem almost thrown in as an afterthought.</P>
<P>     Writer/director Agnes Varda uses color to supplement the normal
black-and-white in which JACQUOT is presented.  Several scenes explode
to life in a vivid display of hues, accenting a particular emotion or
highlighting a scene.  For the most part, it's an effective technique,
although one that is possibly a little overused.  Also in color are
numerous clips from Demy's films.  The inclusion of these works very
well, showing how incidents from the man's real life impacted the
movies he was to make.</P>
<P>     The acting is solid from top to bottom, with the three young
actors who play the growing Jacquot (Philippe Maron, Edouard Joubeaud,
and Laurent Monnier) giving consistent performances that make for a
smooth transition from one to the next.  The occasional appearances of
the real Jacques Demy on-screen lends JACQUOT a bittersweet quality
that it might not otherwise have had.  In some ways, the scenes with
him, lovingly filmed by Ms. Varda, are the most moving of the picture.</P>
<P>     The sense of period in JACQUOT is excellent, from the streets and
countryside of World War II France to the garage and attic of the Demy
house.  As mentioned, detail is crucial to this movie and, at least in
rolling back the years, such obvious care brings dividends.</P>
<P>     Even for those who, like me, have never seen anything by Demy, the
depiction of the relationship between his memories and work is a source
of fascination  The clips from eleven films help immeasurably in this
respect, yet even without them, there are enough moments in JACQUOT to
warrant it a look from those who don't lose patience with this kind of
simple, relaxed style.</P>
