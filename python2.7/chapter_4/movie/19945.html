<P>IN SHORT: A delirious and insanely funny Eddie Murphy-Steve Martin
flick.</P>
<P>Cranky wishes he had bought popcorn futures when he had the chance 'cuz
we're on such a run of fast paced fun flicks that I'm having serious
trouble maintaining this Cranky veneer. What makes it even worse is
that, very close to the beginning of Bowfinger which, unlike Holy Man,
is an Eddie Murphy movie, the number one action star in the entire
BF-Universe, Kit Ramsey turns full figure to the camera and proclaims
"We're trying to make a movie here, not a film!"</P>
<P>And how many Fall Oscar wannabe Seasons have come and gone with poor old
Cranky trying to explain the difference? For once, we get a movie that
sets out purely to entertain strictly on the simplest level. By whacking
the funnybone with all the strength it can muster. And not a single
vomit joke or instance of gratuitous nudity in any of the whacks. Good
old fashioned funny stuff.</P>
<P>This may be one of those times when I get more than my fair share of the
jokes, having worked both sides of the film production fence. Simply,
anyone who sees enough movies to have a general image of what
"Hollywood" is like won't have any trouble following this saber-sharp
satire of what the have-nots in Hollywood will do to become part of the
in-crowd, that crowd being the respected (however temporary) A-list
producers.</P>
<P>Let's begin with Robert "Bobby" Bowfinger (Steve Martin), sole
proprietor of Bowfinger International, a run down hacienda somewhere in
the lesser neighborhoods of LA. Bowfinger, known for his commercial work
and extraordinary documentary "The Yugo Story" is down to his last
nickel when he discovers the script that he thinks will turn his dregs
of a life into gold. It's called Chubby Rain, featuring an invasion of
aliens so tiny they ride raindrops. Thus, chubby. The problem is, the
only way to get it made is to have a heavy duty producer behind you.
Someone like Jerry Renfro (Robert Downey Jr.) who will support the
project only if a name-brand star signs for the title role. Someone like
Kit Ramsey (Murphy) a paranoid racist superstar, firmly in the clutches
of a support organization called Mind Head (which is not like
Scientology at all. My lawyers say I should say that so I don't get
sued) whose upper member wear standard grey suits (n.l.s.a.a.) and who
use a brain-meter to monitor their members actions and emotions
(n.l.s.a.a.). Bowfinger comes up with the idea that, as long as they get
it in one take and shoot covertly, they can walk up to the star and do
their stuff and bingo! A film.</P>
<P>Let's talk about the cast, 'cuz to say much more about the story would
mean revealing the jokes and though there are many, many of them, they
just build up upon each other until entrepreneur comes into conflict
with the grey suited ruler of Mind Head, Terry Stricter (Terence Stamp).
I won't spoil it. There's Carol (Christine Baranski), who passes up a
small way-Off-Broadway part to do her finest work, a la Norma Desmond.
Daisy (Heather Graham), fresh off the bus from Ohio, but a sexual
manipulator par excellence. Scream star Jamie Kennedy is Bowfinger's
right hand cameraman and newcomer Adam Alexi-Malle is the accountant
turned screenwriter, who gets to show off all the top-dollar (well,
maybe top half-dollar) special effects. Finally, there's Jiff (also
Eddie Murphy) a soft-brained lookalike who does all the hard parts and
makes runs to the local Starbucks. With stolen equipment and the
cheapest crew possible, Bowfinger manages to undercut the legendary
Troma Films by producing his epic on a staggering budget of $2814.</P>
<P>Eddie Murphy does his best work when he plays more than one character.
Here, doing only a pair he delivers his sharpest work since Dr. Dolittle
1. Steve Martin, also responsible for the script, continues to prove
that the less crazy he gets, the funnier he gets. And director Frank Oz
continues to prove that he's got a substantial talent, even when his
hand isn't up a Muppet's butt.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Bowfinger, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$7.00</PRE>
<P>At the bottom of Bowfinger, is the simple fact that this pathetic little
man does what he does because he's made promises to his friends that he
will not break. It could have been exploited for a big "Aw" but it
wasn't. Thanks, Frank. All the characters fit some kind of stereotype;
all are 2 1/2 dimensional, but that's more than fine for a killer
popcorn flick.</P>
