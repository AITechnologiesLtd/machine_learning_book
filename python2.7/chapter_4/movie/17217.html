<P>   If "The Corrputor" were widely shown throughout the world
and taken at all seriously, tourism as we know it in New
York's most popular ethnic neighborhood would grind to a
halt.  Directed by James Foley and photographed in a noir
style by Juan Ruiz-Anchia, Robert Pucci's tale of conflicting
loyalties features the usual shoot-ups and car chases that
threaten to make it yet another wide-screen video game.  Yet
the film is partially redeemed by a solid performance from the
magnetically handsome Chow Yun-Fat as a detective on the
take whose  relationship with his partner (played by Mark
Wahlberg) is at first contentious.  Once a proper view of his
colleague takes root, he becomes a sadder, wiser, reclaimed
man.  There's even the customary friction between the local
police and the FBI.  We've been through this theme quite a
few times before, and Robert Pucci's screenplay breaks no
new ground, but Howard E. Smith's editing helps to keep the
chases fleet, the explosions cataclysmic, and the body count
high.</P>
<P>   Director Foley's vision is of a Chinatown that hasn't a
single tourist or an honest Chou Wonton, but there is an
ample supply of happy hookers, forlorn illegal immigrants, and a pair
of battling gangs that make Pell Street look like a modern
Shiloh and Mott Street a contemporary Gettsburg.  </P>
<P>   A neighborhood compulsively on the take with the Tongs
and the Fuks (pronounced "Fooks and so-named because
they were originally from China's Fukien province) eager for
the lion's share of the spoils.  Heroin and hookers mean big
bucks for the squads of thugs who operate on this turf, the
latter supplied by Chinese illegals smuggled to the land of
liberty at a charge of $40,000 per and compelled to work off
their indentured servitude as prostitutes.  When Danny
Wallace (Mark Wahlberg) is assigned to the police precinct
manned mostly by Chinese-Americans, he incurs the hostility
of officer Nick Chen (Chow Yun-Fat), not because Danny is
white, but because, according to Nick, "he's green."  The
assignee comes across as a Goody Two-shoes who is more
eager than the ethnic cops to protect the good people of
Chinatown.  Though studies have recently shown that the
vast majority of police use their pieces not a single time in
their entire careers, Danny blasts away almost from his first
day on the new beat.  In fact the detective duo with their
9mm issue regularly mow down their opponents, who are
armed with Uzi-style firepower.  As is typical in this genre, the
two cops save in other's lives in turn, which bonds them
forever, but when Nick--who is in the pocket of mobster
Henry Lee (Ric Young)--is ordered to kill his colleague, he is
as conflicted as Paul Vitti in Harold Ramis's "Analyze This."</P>
<P>   Mark Wahlberg, a handsome performer who stood out in a
better role in the far superior "Boogie Nights" is soft-spoken
throughout and convinces no one in the audience (to say
nothing of his partner) that he's a cop, but the reverse is true
of Chow Yun-Fat who like Jackie Chan has shifted from the
Hong Kong action market to Hollywood's bigger bucks. 
Chow's every emotion shows easily on his finely-chiseled
face, though he did better when facing off with Mira Sorvino
in "Replacement Killers."  Under the direction of John Woo--
who is every bit the cop-picture director that James Foley is
not--he wowed his cult audience seven years ago with "Hard
Boiled," the all-time favorite of online film critic Steve Kong. 
"The Corruptor" is a convoluted clutter, even tacking on a
subplot involving Danny's desperate cop-turned-bad father for
no reason other than to confuse us further.  What  a shame
that director Foley had to be stuck with this project
considering his brilliance at the helm of one of the
touchstones of all movies dealing with the human capacity for
corruption, "Glengarry Glen Ross." </P>
