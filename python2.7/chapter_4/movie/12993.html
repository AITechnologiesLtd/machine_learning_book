<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>I think I'm just barely too young to have been part of that 80s series
of Movies for Rebellious Teenagers.  I've seen The Breakfast Club, and I
think it's a pretty good film.  I've seen only parts of some of the
other noteable ones (like Say Anything and Fast Times at Ridgemont
High), so whatever cliches exist in this genre are likely to have passed
me up if they were present in Can't Hardly Wait.  I thoroughly enjoyed
myself through this film, for not only is it a smart and funny movie,
but it captures the essence of high school perfectly.</P>
<P>I've read a lot of reviews for Can't Hardly Wait before writing my own
(typically I don't like to do this, but, because I've procrastinated so
much, it was unavoidable).  Most of the critics are saying the same
things, complaining about stereotype characters and standard situations,
et cetera.  It seems pretty clear to me that Deborah Kaplan and Harry
Elfont, who co-wrote and co-directed, were very conscious of the angle
they took.  High school was little more than stereotype characters and
standard situations, and Can't Hardly Wait does a great job of making
fun of every degree of the caste.</P>
<P>It's the night of graduation, and there's a big party.  The film
doesn't follow a strict narrative or plotting, but does a good job of
introducing some fun characters and giving them high-school-ish things
to do.  The most central character is Preston (Ethan Embry), the typical
nice guy (and smart guy -- we immediately learn that he's off to
Dartmouth in the fall).  His subplot revolves around his love for Amanda
(Jennifer Love Hewitt), who has just been dumped by her four-year jock
boyfriend, Mike (Peter Facinelli).  </P>
<P>Preston is friends with Denise (Lauren Ambrose), a cynical misanthrope
(are all misanthropes cynical?), who gets trapped in the bathroom with
Kenny (Seth Green).  Kenny is a white guy who pretends that a) he's
black, and b) he's a slick ladies man.  Denise shows him that he's
neither one.  Then there's William (Charlie Korsmo), the genius nerd who
finally gets drunk and finds that the ladies are more attracted to
intelligence than he had initially thought.  </P>
<P>Can't Hardly Wait flows nicely through the twenty-four hours in which
it takes place (beginning with graduation and ending with a nice scene
in a train station).  Kaplan and Elfont have constructed the film
intelligently, and put some familiar tricks to good use (I liked the way
Preston's letter gets into Amanda's hands).  They also keep the popular
music raging throughout the picture; even though this dates the film
severely, it certainly will bring back not-so-distant memories for
anyone in my generation.  </P>
<P>I also liked the actors and their characters.  Are they really
stereotypes?  Well, I suppose.  A few critics agree that the only
interesting character is Denise, but since I know so many people like
her, I found her no more interesting than anyone else.  I could enjoy
myself watching Jennifer Love Hewitt scrape paint off a wall, so her
acting ability is negligible for me (although I do think she's a
talented actress).  Embry is endearing with his puppy dog eyes (and he
could win a Matthew McConaughey look-alike contest).  I also enjoyed
Facinelli's over-the-top imitation of the Head Jock.  I hate jocks, and
he does a great job making fun of them (and he could win a Tom Cruise
look-alike contest).</P>
<P>If I have any complaints, it's that the movie kind of lags through the
middle.  The pace is swift, but it gets a bit repetitive at times.  But
on the whole, Can't Hardly Wait is a funny and intelligent film about
the late teenage years.  High school, which, for this reviewer, ended
just two short years ago, was nothing more than a bunch of stereotypical
people searching for themselves.  There's no doubt in my mind that
Kaplan and Elfont had this fact in mind as they made their film -- Can't
Hardly Wait is a movie that any kid who grew up in the 90s will
appreciate.  </P>
