<PRE>                               MARS ATTACKS!
                       A film review by P-M Agapow
                        Copyright 1997 P-M Agapow</PRE>
<P>A fleet of flying saucers had set off from Mars and surrounded
Earth. The President (Nicholson) wants to greet them with open
arms, reassured by his chief scientist's (Brosnan) claims that
every advanced civilisation is peaceful. His chief of the armed
forces (Steiger) seethes anger, asking for a pre-emptive strike.
Those little green guys just can't be trusted.</P>
<P>"Mars Attacks" came out too close on the tail of
"In-duh-pendence Day" for the former to be intended to be a send
up of the latter.  But that's what it is, a boisterous
celebration of all the cliches of oldtime (and not so old) scifi,
with angst-torn Presidents, intrepid reporters, gun-nuts,
peacenik scientists, whooping and creaking "electronic
tonalities" by Danny Elfman and of course the sadistic,
treacherous Martians.  At times the film even has that bleached
out, over-exposed look of an 50's SF film.</P>
<P>The Martians are a pure delight. Conversing in a strange
honking language, with bulbous and veiny skulls, exploding in a
shower of green ichor, they cheat, they lie, they gleefully run
riot with rayguns (with deathbeams of two different colours, no
less), monotonally chanting stock phrases: "Don't run away - we
are your friends".  Their computer animation is a triumph - it
may not look realistic (come on - dayglo little green men in blue
suits?)  but it is very effective. They twitch and sneer and cry
and laugh, in a completely expressive way. Their tinny flying
saucers and gothic interiors are also wonderful.</P>
<P>"Mars Attacks" is loaded, even over-loaded, with name actors
of whom some do amazingly good work for such a silly movie.  Jack
Nicholson acts for perhaps the first time in years, putting in a
surprisingly complex portrayal of the President.  Pierce Brosnan
and Sarah Jessica Parker are amusing, if one note, as a
pipe-puffing boffin and air-headed reporter respectively.
Annette Bening confirms that she is perhaps one of the most
under-valued actresses in Hollywood with her alcoholic new-ager.
Rod Steiger delights as a warhawk general screaming "Attack!
Attack!  Kill!  Kill!".</P>
<P>But this is perhaps where the big problem with "Mars Attacks"
is: there's just too much going on with little of it getting
anywhere.  The opportunity to use all these big stars seems to
have clouded Burton's judgement (and he is not a disciplined
filmmaker at the best of times), with each getting their five
minutes of screen time.  Bening, delightful as she is, and
Nicholson's second role (as a Vegas entrepreneur) should have been
snipped altogether, as could Glen Close (in a thankless role as
as the First Lady), Pam Grier and Michael J Fox.  This might have
given the remaining sections the development they sorely need at
times.</P>
<P>Sometimes rushed or crowded, often batty and probably for movie
and SF fans only (others are unlikely to appreciate the jokes),
"Mars Attacks" would make for a great video night with the right
audience, cheering it and themselves on.  [***/interesting] and
"coruscating beams of destruction" on the Sid and Nancy scale.</P>
