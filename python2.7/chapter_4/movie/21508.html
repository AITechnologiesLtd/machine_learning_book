Rated R.</P>
<P>The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc is an intelligent film with
intelligent ideas. It has a more-than-workable script and a first-rate
cast. Its problems lie in its tone and execution. Director Luc Besson
(the n is silent), whose last film was the visually stunning The Fifth
Element doesn't quite realize this project's potential. His rampant use
of humor is often inappropriate and while it may generate a laugh, it
also serves to spoil the mood. There are limits to everything.</P>
<P>The two-and-a-half hour film stumbles out of the starting line, opening
with a map of Europe accompanied by a historical summary in the form of
titles which race across the screen at a jaw-droppingly fast pace,
leaving most of the audience in the dust (but worry not: if you want to
know some of the history behind the movie, simply read the next
paragraph; contrarily if you do not want to know what happens, skip the
next three). The film goes on to tell the still controversial story of
Joan of Arc, the teenager who led France to victory over England in the
13th century, claiming to be a messenger from God.</P>
<P>Around the turn of the (13th) century, France and England signed a
treaty providing that upon the death of France's ruler, France shall
become part of England's kingdom. The kings of both countries die
within months of each other, leaving France in the hands of the new
king of England, who is only a few months old at the time. France's
Dauphin (played here by John Malkovich) has no intention of giving up
his country to an infant and puts up a hell of a defense against the
formidable British military.</P>
<P>Enter Joan of Arc. This spunky 19 year-old believes that she is
receiving messages directly from the Big Kahuna himself. She thinks God
is telling her to lead the French army to victory against the British
to save the French Empire and make a king out of the Dauphin. The
Dauphin, eager to please the masses and ready to jump at any chance to
put a crown on his head, gives her the army. Joan takes control and
gets some stunning victories, one of which she obtains merely by
telling the British to "go home."</P>
<P>France is free and the Dauphin is king, but the story is far from over.
Her tales of messages from God rise suspicions of witchcraft on her
part, turning her saga into the best-known witchcraft trial ever sans
Salem. The last act of the film covers this in detail, and it is by far
the best The Messenger has to offer; the most powerful and compelling
part of the movie is its last.</P>
<P>Imagine, if you will, an intense battle scene. The sets are elaborate,
the action is frenetic, the music is blaring, the audience is really
into it. Everyone is excited. All of a sudden, a guy's head gets
chopped off and we see the headless body still standing upright, with
blood copiously spurting out of where the head was supposed to be. This
elicits groans and laughs from the audience. The mood is ruined, the
excitement is diffused. This is The Messenger's main ailment. Besson
ruins important scenes by playing them to comic effect. I have no
problem with dark humor in an epic film like this one but it has to be
done right and in places where it fits. What this film does is like
mixing oil and water; instead of blending seamlessly, the humor and the
action interfere with each other, making for an uneven confection.</P>
<P>The 24-year-old Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element) plays the title
character with gusto but little grace which, I suppose, was the
intention. Jovovich is a relatively unknown actress and casting her was
a good idea; Joan is a controversial character and should not be
interfered with by an actress with an established personality. The
supporting cast is dynamite. John Malkovich provides some of the
appropriate comic relief in the movie as does Dustin Hoffman whose
character is significant and whose role I will not reveal for the sake
of preserving some of the film's non-historical surprises.</P>
<P>The Messenger is decidedly not a blockbuster. It has the gall not to
portray Joan as a hero, suggesting, more than anything else, that she
was indeed insane. This came as a pleasant surprise: here is a big-
budget movie that takes a big risk, straying from the crowd-pleasing
notion of heroism and woman-saves-the-world feminism. It works by
defying that expectation, by proposing a stand on an issue rather than
merely telling a version of the story.</P>
<P>In the midst of all this, Besson does not forget to thoroughly
modernize the tale, inserting generous amounts of '90s imagery and
employing a version of the ever-popular MTV filmmaking style, though
not settling into it as much as the stylistically similar Stigmata did
earlier this year. I can't well imagine The Messenger working without
all that imagery; it fits the story like a glove. As far as I'm
concerned, MTV itself is the spawn of Satan, but it sure does do
wonders for some films.</P>
<P>Most of what works in The Messenger is contained in its last 3rd and
what comes before it struck me as hastily put together. It's as if the
script wants to perfunctorily rush through the formalities and get to
the points it wants to make as painlessly as humanly possible. The
result is an extremely uneven first hour and a half. But the film's
terrific finale is enough, I think, to warrant a trip to the multiplex.</P>
