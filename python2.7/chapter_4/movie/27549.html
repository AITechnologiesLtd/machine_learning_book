<P>PLOT:
A very pretty, but lonely, wedding planner unknowingly falls for a guy whose
wedding she is planning. As the wedding day approaches, she and the
groom-to-be spend more and more time together, and then...well, I think we
could pretty much all guess the rest, eh?</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Whose opinion do you think is more important for this type of movie? Me or
my girlfriend's? Well, as it turns out, she and I had diametrically opposed
opinions about this movie, so let's try this experiment and play the ol' "he
said, she said" game:</P>
<P>HE SAID:
Jennifer Lopez looked really beautiful in this movie. Matthew McConaughey
also looked mighty handsome. But put all that beauty aside and whadda you
got? Jack all! In fact, here's yet another example of a movie that blows
away its entire story in one 30-second trailer. Trust me...if you've seen
the trailer, you've seen the movie, folks! Sure, there are a couple of
"Jennifer acting cute" moments and the décor nice to look at, but the film
as a whole is just too hollow, predictable, fluffy and tired. In fact, I'm
personally starting to get really tired of watching these 1-2-3 romantic
comedies. And oh yeah, I think I forgot to mention corny. I don't know,
maybe I just don't "get" this kind of movie since many people in our
audience seemed to be enjoying themselves. But try as I might, I just could
not see past this film's obvious story line, I'm talking from scene one to
scene last, lack of chemistry between the leads, crappy dialogue and phony
baloney "family" moments. Blech! I just didn't buy any of it!</P>
<P>The whole thing just smelled like a "vehicle" for a couple of movie stars
looking for a "romantic comedy" project. Even the so-called "comic relief"
Italian boyfriend in this movie did nothing but annoy me with his accent.
And was Alex Rocco really trying to sound Italian, too? Boy-oh-boy. But I
could sometimes even forgive predictability when the film as a whole is able
to entertain, or at least make me laugh, but even there, this film came up
very, very short. It was just so damn ho-hum! I mean, did you read the plot
breakdown up there? Lopez and McConaughey basically just walk around trying
to find stuff for his wedding the whole time...walk here, walk there, talk
about this inconsequential something, talk about that inconsequential
something. And why was it that this sexy, gorgeous, sensitive, loving, smart
businesswoman didn't have a boyfriend in the first place, you may ask? God
knows. I guess it made sense for the plot...but sadly, the plot doesn't
carry much weight in the real world. Ugh. See this movie if you liked any of
the other romantic comedies that I gave low scores to below. That would mean
that we don't see eye to eye on these types of movies and that this one
might appeal to you. And the missus' point of view...?</P>
<P>SHE SAID:
Well, she saw it all under a different light. She loved the whole look of
this movie, the flowers, the dresses, the clothes, the locales...all that
crap...uhhhm ,I mean, stuff! (Note to self: She might be trying to tell you
something, you commitment phobic dunce!). Anyway, she also bought into the
whole "will McConaughey and Lopez" end up together "mystery" (granted, she
hadn't seen the trailer) and thought that all of the characters were
believable and well-developed enough to care about (yup, she shed tears,
folks!). She also loved all of the romance sprinkled throughout the film
(the tango scene in particular) and really enjoyed the performance put forth
by the over-the-top Italian guy with the accent (natch!). Anyhoo, the one
thing that we did agree on was that the film didn't necessarily have many
humorous moments. Overall, not an original piece of work, but apparently fun
to watch (according to her). She scored it a 7/10.</P>
