NO PLACE TO GO
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Freedom isn't good for everyone.  It isn't for Hanna Flanders (Hannelore 
Elsner), a widely published East German writer.  After the fall of the 
Berlin wall, Western publishers have been rejecting her work, with one 
deriding it as "intellectual crap."  Not surprisingly, she has a 
different view of her situation, believing that Western publishers are 
nothing but "cultural Nazis."  Whoever is right, one thing is certain, 
Hanna is flagrantly spending what little money she has left and is 
heading for disaster.</P>
<P>Filmed in a hazy black and white, writer/director Oskar Röhler's NO 
PLACE TO GO (DIE UNBERÜHRBARE) is an unrelentingly bleak film that has 
little idea with what to do with its theme of a once popular writer cast 
adrift.  With a large black wig that looks like a starched mop, Hanna 
bears a strange resemblance to the infamous Mrs. Robinson from THE 
GRADUATE.  Elsner's acting is impressive, but the story provides little 
reason to care about her.  Setting a glacial pace, the director takes a 
long time to say very little.  Watching NO PLACE TO GO, you're likely to 
think about all of the other places to which you could go if you weren't 
waiting for the film's inevitable conclusion.</P>
<P>NO PLACE TO GO runs a long 1:40.  The film is in German with English 
subtitles.  It is not rated but would be an R for nudity, sexual 
situations and language.  It would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
