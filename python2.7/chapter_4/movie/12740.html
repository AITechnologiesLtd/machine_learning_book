<P>Imagine, if you will, the embarrassment of participating in a tabloid
t.v. talk show, believing you are going to get a free makeover and
instead your best friend reveals that that she is having an affair with
your husband.  Shocking?  Yes, of course.  Or is it?  Welcome to life in
the 90's.  We have been trained through the tabloid media (and in some
cases, the mainstream media) in our society whether its print, t.v.,
radio, Internet access, etc., to be less shocked at the outrageous than
at any other time this century; to accept the decadent behaviour of
others and laugh it off as if it were nothing.  Yet some are still
shocked by what happens to them in life.</P>
<P>In 'Hope Floats', Sandra Bullock stars as an average, everyday person
who gets duped by the situation described in the opening paragraph.  She
then leaves Chicago and travels to her hometown of Smithville, Texas,
and moves back in with her mother (Gena Rowlands).  She brings her
daughter with her (Mae Whitman).  Her little girl is about 8 and is at
that very impressionable age where observations can direct the course of
her life and disappointment can be difficult to deal with.  She begins
to re-unite with members of the community with whom she went to high
school and gets a job working in a photo shop.  Bullock was the "corn
queen" in her youth in the small town, a type of beauty or prom queen if
you will who still looks very good.  One of the people that she meets is
an old flame (Harry Connick Jr.) and while she isn't over the loss of
her husband, a little spark of romantic history between her and Connick
is visible.</P>
<P>In the first hour of the film, most of the best lines, written by Steven
Rogers, are delivered by the cast and while all the elements in the film
are obvious and predictable, I never get tired of watching ordinary
people living ordinary lives and I refuse to give in to the cynicism of
criticizing a film like this because of simple elements and there are
some very clever moments in 'Hope Floats' where dialogue floats like
spice and has a sugar coated core.</P>
<P>Directed Forest Whitaker has used his camera quite eloquently to capture
the hum drum (that's meant as a compliment) and likable elements of
small town life and guides his cast through the realities of life with
traditional elements of characterization developed in relating to the
everyday problems, joys and surprises of life's unpredictable path.</P>
<P>The film's strongest moments are when Gena Rowlands is on screen.  An
actress of vast experience and motherly charm in this film, she is the
rock of stability for her daughter and grand daughter and is the best
member of the cast.  The most under written member of the cast is Harry
Connick Jr.  His character isn't used to its full potential and this is
a disappointment.  At one point over dinner, Bullock refers to him using
her husband's name and this drew gasps of shock from some female members
of the audience with whom I viewed this film.</P>
<P>'Hope Floats' is a wonderful date movie, produced in part by Sandra
Bullock and despite its unoriginal story and overall presentation, I
can't disregard a movie that makes me feel good because that would be a
sin.</P>
