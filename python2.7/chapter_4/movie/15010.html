<P>     LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, a fancifully dark Italian comedy from
co-writer/director/star Roberto Benigni, has inspired one of the most
misguided criticisms of recent years.  A large portion of the film, set in
Italy circa 1939-1945, involves an Italian family in a concentration camp:
Jewish bookseller Guido Orefice (Benigni); his Gentile wife Dora
(Nicoletta Braschi); and their five-year-old son Giosue (Giorgio
Cantarini).  In an effort to protect his son from the terrifying reality
of their situation, Guido convinces Giosue that they are playing a grand
game, collecting points for being quiet or remaining hidden.  When German
soldiers arrive at the bunkhouse to announce the camp rules, Guido feigns
being able to translate into Italian so he can announce the rules of the
"game" to Giosue; when Giosue hears stories of the evils going on at the
camp, Guido laughingly dismisses them as the attempts of other "players"
to gain a psychological advantage.</P>
<P>     The criticism leveled at LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL is that it is a sanitized
version of the Holocaust, which somehow diminishes the gravity of the
tragedy by squeezing humor from it.  The absurdity of that criticism is
that it seems to miss the point entirely.  Guido's entire purpose in the
second half of the film becomes sanitizing the Holocaust, turning the
experience into something his son can survive both physically and
emotionally.  Benigni crafts a sensitive relationship between the father
and son, as Guido's wit and imagination allow him to create a world of
pleasure and hope where no pleasure or hope should be possible.  There are
more than enough grim reminders of the camp's true purpose -- as well as a
glimpse of banal evil in the character of an obliviously self-absorbed
physician (Horst Buchholz) -- to dismiss any notion that Benigni as a
film-maker is candy-coating one of the bleakest chapters in human history.
His character, however, is doing exactly that; his success is a triumph of
love and determination in the creation of their own reality.</P>
<P>     The irony of that misguided criticism is that there's a much simpler
reason to be less than dazzled by LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL -- namely, most of the
first hour.  In essence, it's an _extremely_ extended prologue,
introducing us to Guido as a carefree seeker of love and fortune who
directs his creative energies towards winning Dora's heart.  The pleasant
scenes between them certainly establish their bond, as well as Guido's
imaginative gifts, but on their own they're fairly innocuous bits of
romantic tomfoolery.  Benigni mixes physical comedy with the occasional
social commentary, all with moderate success and the sense that he's just
passing time until he can get to the real meat of the story.  It's easy to
imagine Benigni setting up all the necessary relationships in about half
the time, making the shift in tone less abrupt...and making shifting in
your seat less necessary.</P>
<P>     None of that detracts from the potent, bittersweet pleasures of the
film's second half.  All of the things that could have gone wrong instead
go right -- the young Cantarini radiates charming innocence without
cloying self-awareness; Benigni hits just the right balance between clown
and unlikely hero; the darker moments always feel consistent with the
human comedy.  LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL grows richer by the minute, making it
easy to forgive the amiable but meandering first half. If it hadn't takeng
quite so long to reach its most powerful scenes, LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL would
have been an easy choice as one of the year's best films.  An expression
as trite as "triumph of the human spirit" doesn't quite do justice to what
Benigni has pulled off here.  He has taken pure horror and turned it into
a whimsical love story -- between a man and a woman, between a man and his
son, between a man and the idea that we never lose the capacity to create
beauty in our lives.</P>
