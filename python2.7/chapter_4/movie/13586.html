<PRE>Review by R.L. Strong</PRE>
<P>Since Jackie Chan broke onto the U.S. film scene with 1996's "Rumble
in the Bronx", we've been subjected to a rather mixed bag of films
starring the famed go for broke action star. The main problem with the
majority of Jackie's films is that (as many other critics have noted),
his films don't have a very strong plot line. But first and foremost,
Jackie has always been the reason to see these films. With the
upcoming release of "Who Am I?", we are witness to a vital change in
Jackie's screen trade. This time we have a plot.</P>
<P>The plot of the film starts off with the discovery of a strange isotope
from a meteorite found in a deep cave in some un-named location. The
isotope is checked and discovered to have unlimited energy potential.
As the isotope is being transported through South Africa, the scientist
are ambushed by an elite team of commandos (one of which is Jackie).
Stealing the computer information which could lead to harnessing this
energy, the commandoes  helicopter crashing into the brush.</P>
<P>Jackie awakens slowly over an undisclosed period of time. He has been
nursed back to health by an African tribe. As Jackie regains full
consciousness, he is asked by the tribesman who he is and where he
comes from. Jackie, suffering from amnesia, cannot remember his name
or how he came to be in the village. He asks the Village Chief
(Washington Xisolo), who am I? Misunderstanding him, the Chief believes
Jackie's name to be "Whoami", and this is what they call him.</P>
<P>Jackie is adopted by the tribe. He learns their language and their
culture, becoming a part of their society. During this time, Whoami
(Jackie Chan) regains bits and pieces of him memory. Realizing that
he most go back to civilization to discover his past, Jackie leaves
the tribe and goes off in search of himself.</P>
<P>This is the initial setup for the film, and I found this to be so
enjoyably quirky and different that I found myself wanting more.
Jackie's performance in the film is as good as anything he's ever
done. But those scenes in the African village are truly unique in
that we (U.S. movie-goers) finally get to see that Jackie is much
more than a high kicking stunt man. He IS an actor. The other
performances in the film are a hit and miss affair, but there is
nothing here that is as embarrassing as any of the gangsters in
"MR. NICE GUY" (1998). In fact on of the surprises of the film is
the return of Ed Nelson ("Attack of the Crab Monsters" )to the
screen as the corrupt General Sherman. Mr. Nelson is obviously
enjoying his role in this film and tries his best to give a
Cormanesque performance. The two female leads Mira Yamamoto as
race driver Yuki and Michelle Ferre as undercover CIA operative,
Christine are both working on screen for the first time and are
not called upon to do anything very strenuous, but they are
appealing and easy on the eyes.  The remainder of the cast are up
to the task, with Ron Smerczak doing a fine job as the evil arms
broker, Morgan.</P>
<P>Now of course everyone knows that Jackie does all of his own stunts,
and this film is no different. That "Oh My God" quality is still there
in abundance. Jackie is still the hardest working star on screen
today. We've heard other actors claim to do their own stunts, but no
one has that "go for it" attitude that Jackie has. Some critics have
called Jackie a Human yo-yo, and in one absolutely amazing stunt,
literally proves it. Trust me! Your mouth will remain open in
amazement for the next five minutes. There are fight scenes here that
are just unbelievably complex and inventively funny. A classic example
is a fight in the streets of Rotterdam with a set of Wooden Shoes.</P>
<P>The script by Jackie, Susan Chan and Lee Reynolds is remarkably
tight. Once the power of the isotope is explained, it becomes less of
an issue. The driving issue is tied to Jackie's attempts to rediscover
his own identity and the growing conflict he is having his past and
adoptive personality. As the film progresses, flashbacks are used to
fill in the blanks in the plot, creating a sense of urgency that is
very enjoyable. The direction by Benny Chan is reminiscent of some of
the more extreme work of Sammo Hung Kam-po. There is as much camera
movement as in any John Carpenter film, and it's use is marvelously
inventive. Co-Directed by Jackie himself (obviously handling the
action scenes) the film is a solid whole. In the past, Jackie has had
many disagreements with his directors, but here it seems that a mutual
cooperation is at work for the film holds together much better that
any of Jackie previous films since "Drunken Master 2".</P>
<P>The Cinematography by Hang-Sang Poon is beautiful. Africa has not
looked this majestic since "The Naked Prey" or "Born Free". Scenes of
the tribesmen shot from on high are sumptuous in their presentation,
giving these native people and their land a regal quality that is awe
inspiring.</P>
<P>One of the most appealing aspects of the film are the scenes with the
African villagers. In the past, it could be said that Jackie (and most
Hong Kong filmmakers) were a bit insensitive to other customs and
cultures. Here, there is nothing but honor and respect. This un-named
African tribe is presented with honor for both their customs and
individuals. The scenes of ritual dance are wonderful to watch. These
scene make you want so much more.</P>
<P>"Who Am I?" is a grand return from Jackie, a few mis-steps. A film
that honors Jackie's past achievements and points to a very promising
future.</P>
