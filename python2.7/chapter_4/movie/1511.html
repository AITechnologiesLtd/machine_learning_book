<PRE>                                STAY TUNED
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<PRE>90 min., PG, Comedy, 1992
Director: Peter Hayanas
Cast: John Ritter, Pam Dawber, Jeffrey Jones, Eugene Levy, Don Calfa,
      Salt-n-Pepper</PRE>
<P>     John Ritter is a tv-aholic.  Salesman Jeffrey Jones shows up at
Ritter's door one night and lets him have a free trial of a satellite
disk.  The disk eats Ritter and his wife, Pam Dawber.  They end up in a
television world, where if they survive for 24 hours, they get sent back
to their house.</P>
<P>     STAY TUNED is a very funny comedy, that makes up for Ritter's last
two mega-bombs PROBLEM CHILD and PROBLEM CHILD 2.  I recommend this
film to any fan of slapstick comedy or any movie buff.  On a scale of
zero to five, I give STAY TUNED a four.  STAY TUNED is rated PG for
adult situations.</P>
<P>     I think the thing I disliked the most about this film was the
beginning credits.  They tried to make fun of the opening credits of
some action and science fiction films.  I think that they could have
been better.  The beginning of the end credits was cute though.  The
names of upcoming television shows, like "Unmarried with Children" (one
of the lamer ones), are put on the screen, so you may want to stick
around.</P>
<P>     Some of the humor is Mel-Brookish in nature, especially the
Salt-n-Pepper video.  The film was constantly amusing and often
hilarious, but I doubt that it will do as well as similar films, like
HOT SHOTS! and THE NAKED GUN 2 1/2: THE SMELL OF FEAR, considering some
of the other films out in the theaters, like UNFORGIVEN, SINGLE WHITE
FEMALE, and TWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME.  Most likely this film will
find its audience when it is released on video cassette (and laser
disk).  None of the film will be lost on video cassette, so if you want
to wait for the video and see other current hits your viewing of the
film won't be harmed.</P>
<P>     I suggest that if you are planning to watch this film, that you try
to avoid seeing any commercials for it because they spoil parts of it
(e.g., "Driving Over Miss Daisy").  If you plan to see the film, I
suggest that you go see it soon because it has just left the theaters in
my area, and will probably be doing the same in your area soon also.</P>
