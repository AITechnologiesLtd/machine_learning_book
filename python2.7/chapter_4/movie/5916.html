<P>    The third screen adaptation of H.G. Wells' century-old novel is the
worst of two warring worlds:  it's neither suspenseful enough to be
scary nor outrageous enough to qualify as a camp classic.  Marlon Brando
is well-cast as the mad scientist who lives on a remote South Pacific
island, where he can experiment on animals and play God in peace.
Brando plays the part as a continuation of his Kurtz character from
APOCALYPSE NOW, turning every scene of his into an intentional exercise
in absurdity.  His jaw-dropping late arrival-- wearing chalky white
make-up under a billowing white muumuu, among other odd accouterments--
will be long-remembered by film scholars.  And has the summer seen a
stranger sight than that of Brando behind a piano, playing excerpts from
"Rhapsody in Blue" to a roomful of mutant monsters?  As the mad
scientist's mad assistant, Val Kilmer rivals with a doped-up performance
that's almost as audacious.  (Stay awake for a dead-on impersonation of
the big guy, which Val delivers toward the end.) Alas, nothing else in
this movie even comes close to working the way it should.  The human
elements never connect, the animal actors look ridiculous, and any
affecting social commentary is saved for the last sixty seconds. </P>
