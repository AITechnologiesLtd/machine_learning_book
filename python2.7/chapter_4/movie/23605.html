<P>           Julia Roberts may not be a great actress, but she is a
genuine star, a presence that captivates an audience. Likewise, "Erin
Brockovich" may not be a great drama, but it is a first-rate
button-pusher, a contemporary David and Goliath story guaranteed to get
viewers cheering. Put Julia and "Erin" together, and you've got a movie
to reckon with.</P>
<P>  "Erin" comes from a most unlikely source, director Steven
Soderbergh, whose interests tend to run to either crime dramas ("Out of
Sight," "The Limey") or semi-arty explorations of human psychology
("sex, lies and videotape," "King of the Hill"). But despite having
Roberts in the leading role, "Erin" doesn't represent Soderbergh selling
out. Quite the contrary, in fact, since the film is full of Soderbergh's
trademark jump-cuts, hand-held camera shots and utterly off-the-wall
humor.</P>
<P>   Best of all, "Erin" represents that rare mainstream Hollywood
crowdpleaser with substance as well as style. Susannah Grant's snappy
screenplay lays out the saga of Brockovich (Roberts), a twice-divorced
mother of three with a smart mouth, marginal work experience, and a
clinging, cleavage-revealing wardrobe she apparently picked up at
Samantha Fox's garage sale.</P>
<P>    Yet somehow Erin manages to land a position as a clerk in
the law offices of Ed Masry (Albert Finney), and when some suspicious
documents in real estate files arouse her curiosity, Erin gets
permission to investigate. Her research eventually pits Masry's tiny
practice against Pacific Gas and Electric, a $28 billion monster that
doesn't want its dirty laundry hung out in public.</P>
<P>    The plot conjures up memories of "The China Syndrome" and
"Norma Rae," in which Jane Fonda and Sally Field respectively locked
horns with callous corporations that put profit and public relations
ahead of safety. But with its bold, ill-tempered central figure, "Erin
Brockovich" is actually closer to the story of Karen Silkwood, another
working-class woman who became a most unlikely crusader for justice.</P>
<P>    However, in contrast to director Mike Nichols' deliberately
paced 1983 film "Silkwood," "Erin" moves at the same speed as its
no-nonsense heroine, brought winningly to life by a surprisingly sassy
Roberts. She's just plain wonderful in the role, whether clashing with
her boss, flirting with her neighbor/babysitter George (Aaron Eckhart)
or bombarding highfalutin lawyers with the details of her work. While
Erin's salty tongue and borderline-slutty clothing initially provoke
laughs, Roberts slowly turns this prickly woman into someone we can
admire and root for.</P>
<P>   Her run-ins with Masry are particularly amusing, as she
bulldozes her way through the legal process and fends off those who want
to take over her project. "Excuse me for not going to law school," the
tempestuous Erin snaps. "Law school?" Masry replies. "At this point, I'd
settle for charm school!"</P>
<P>   Finney, who's kept a fairly low profile recently, is also
fine and often funny as he tries without much success to rein in this
hellion in a halter top, and while Eckhart ("In the Company of Men")
seems a wee bit uncomfortable in grease-stained biker garb, he and
Roberts trade zingers quite well. The supporting cast is also ripe with
top-flight character actors, including Cherry Jones as a strong-willed
woman who's unsure of Erin's motives, Tracey Walter as a creepy stalker
and Conchata Farrell as an envious office manager who delights in giving
Erin a hard time.</P>
<P>  Admittedly, there's a certain degree of calculation in Grant's
script, especially when Erin tangles with the sharp-dressed lawyers for
hire Masry brings on board to help build the case. But the dialogue is
funny enough and the acting so on-target, it's hard to complain. "Erin
Brockovich" was designed to be a crowdpleaser, and that's exactly what
it is. No apologies are necessary. James Sanford</P>
