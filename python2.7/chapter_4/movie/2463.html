<P>"AIDS, like tuberculosis in Thomas Mann's THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN, is just a 
backdrop [in SAVAGE NIGHTS].  Jean's struggle with the illness is also a 
struggle with stupidity, with all sorts of racism, with tyranny...  Jean 
acts as though nothing were different in his daily life.  He continues to 
drink, laugh, and drive fast.  In his own way, he is shattering the 
taboos.  He doesn't let himself get locked into the status of being HIV-
positive, like some people for whom the illness becomes a sort of 
identity card." 
          - Cyril Collard, writer/director/actor, SAVAGE NIGHTS </P>
<P>     French filmmaker Cyril Collard published LES NUITS FAUVES, his
autobiographical novel, in 1989.  It relates events in the life of Jean
(Collard), a 30-year old Parisian who, in 1986, is diagnosed as being
HIV-positive.  Unwilling to acknowledge that the virus has made him
different, Jean continues his promiscuous bisexual life, pursuing a
male lover by the name of Samy (Carlos Lopez), and falling in love with
seventeen-year old Laura (Romane Bohringer).</P>
<P>     In 1992, Mr. Collard (together with longtime companion Corine
Blue) brought the book to the screen.  Released in October of that
year, SAVAGE NIGHTS caused an immediate stir across France.  It went on
to take four Cesars (Best Film, Best First Film, Best Film Editing, and
Best Female Newcomer--Romane Bohringer) in March 1993--three days
after its writer/director/star died of AIDS.</P>
<P>     As was Mr. Collard's intention, this film is about the
relationship between Jean and Laura, with AIDS serving as a vital
backdrop for their interactions.  Theirs is a twisted, dysfunctional
affair, with jealousy and co-dependence working to destroy them.  As a
love story, this is dark and tempestuous, filled with searing arguments
that become progressively more violent.</P>
<P>     The most refreshing facet of SAVAGE NIGHTS is its willingness to
flout political correctness.  After learning of his condition, Jean
does nothing to curb his sexual appetites, nor does he attempt to
practice safe sex.  And, when Jean eventually confides in Laura, her
reaction (after initially being horrified) is to toss away the condom
he proposes to use.  Unlike in PHILADELPHIA, AIDS here does not equate
with near-nobility.</P>
<P>     Giving a stunning performance in her debut is Romane Bohringer,
the talented daughter of actor Richard Bohringer.  The part of Laura,
which not only earned Ms. Bohringer a Cesar, but also the role of the
title character in THE ACCOMPANIST, demands an extreme output of energy
and emotion, and there is no instance when the actress isn't up to the
task.  Her scenes with co-star Cyril Collard crackle with intensity.</P>
<P>     Speaking of Mr. Collard, he wasn't his own first choice for Jean,
but he took the role when no other French actor was willing to risk
playing a character so closely identified with AIDS and bisexuality.
In retrospect, the ultimate casting of Jean is perfect, leaving us this
legacy of Mr. Collard's skills as an actor.</P>
<P>     SAVAGE NIGHTS is not without problems.  The erratic pacing is
amplified by a series of jarring cuts which can make the viewing
experience similar to reading a book without transitions.  Also, there
are times when it's difficult (if not impossible) to sympathize with
the film's protagonist because he's such a self-centered jerk.  This,
in part, leads to a rather unsatisfying final scene.</P>
<P>     Passionate and unrelentingly grim in its portrayal of life on the
edge of death, SAVAGE NIGHTS is a film that refuses to compromise.
This may lead to an uncomfortable movie-going experience; this motion
picture is neither traditionally entertaining nor escapist in nature.
However, for those who want a grittier portrayal of the effects of AIDS
than the one presented in Jonathan Demme's recent PHILADELPHIA, SAVAGE
NIGHTS offers the option.  Few will leave this film unaffected--one
way or another.</P>
