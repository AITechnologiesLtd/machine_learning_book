SUPER FEATURES:The acting, as is customary in Leigh's films.</PRE>
<PRE>         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>To watch this film, or any of Mike Leigh's films, one really has to
appreciate the finer points of acting, in its most developed moments, as is
done in the world's best stages. In this sense, Mr. Leigh is the best
theatre director in film at work today, if Peter Brook has retired.</P>
<P>Some say, that acting is a method, that is learned through a few clever
movements, and actions. Some say that acting is a living truth of some sort
that brings about an internal response, which the actor can not avoid in any
way, and acts with. Mr. Leigh's films, are about the best that one can get
out of the acting, in its furthest point. The result is rather unusual for
film standards, in that it is not exactly a "showy" exercise, or a "fun"
thing, specially when the moments get serious and troublesome for each
character. Taking a slight clue from film makers like Jean Luc Godard and
Francois Truffaut, this director keeps the camera on the actors longer, thus
avoiding the standard crossover conversational shots, and the results are
one of two styles... we either get bored because we have to live through
someone's catharsis, or we just get tremendously excited, because we can
really feel the whole thing, and the director did not quit on the story, or
actor, thus making the film come off much less as entertainment, and a lot
more as a serious exercise in some form of internal psychoanalysis. The
latter is not a favorite American style at all, where many audiences thought
the film "boring", and "slow'.</P>
<P>Life is not always a Hollywood movie on steroids and madness, or a Disney
fantasy, trying to help us escape our very own dreary lives, something that
Hollywood has been guilty of ever since its beginning. In Europe, film is
not always entertainment, and its directions tend to be towards the
"literary" side of things, or to the "artistic" sides of things, which is
always over looked in America due to its top ten money making film
mentality.</P>
<P>But few films can even stand up to the incredible ensemble acting work that
this film provides, that would make the best theatre people of the 20th
century so proud that their craft has developed so beautifully.... the
material may not exactly be Ibsen, or Shaw, or Albee, or Williams, but the
results are no less different and strong. If you had been through an evening
of such strong acting, you would have given the actors a standing ovation.</P>
<P>This is the story of a young woman that goes out to meet her birth mother.
She had been adopted when she was young, and her adoptive parents chose not
to hide anything and let her know that she was adopted, and where she was
acquired from. And when her parents finally die, her journey starts. She
goes after the company that took care of her adoption. The counselor ( the
weakest of all the actors in this film ), is a bit of the 60's mentality in
hipness, but not in content. Like all doctors she also lives in her own
world, and do not really believe people can handle their own affairs. But
Hortense is stronger than that, and she continues on her search.</P>
<P>It leads her to a rather dysfunctional family, who happens to have kept it
all a secret in regards to this particular adoption, that even the mother
does not remember, thus suggesting that she might have had other children
also given away. Cynthia, in her earlier days, seems to have had numerous
affairs, and enjoyed herself. But as she graces into her fifties, her
ability to deal with the past is catching up with her. When she finally
agrees to meet the young woman, she is convinced that she does not have
another child. She finally remembers, that when she was fifteen, she was
forced to put a child she had up for adoption, and that the father was a
young American black boy, she vaguely remembers. However, this is only the
beginning of the story. Here her family plays a major role. Her second
daughter is pregnant and about to get married. And she has a problem with
her mother, which seems to be stemming from some dishonest feelings. The
mother's brother has helped all his life, and has helped keep all the
indiscretions hidden from her family. But when Hortense shows up, the whole
thing gets rather complicated, specially towards the end, when the younger
sister realizes she has another sister, and that she is black, which is a
major shock.</P>
<P>If anything, one would have loved to see this film as a part of the "living
theatre" scene, since it's story and material could easily become endless.
Film tends to tie up things cleverly a la Moliere, just so we do not have
questions. And although this film answers the main questions about its
story, it raises others, and this is so true of life and its daily
moments... call this cinema verite, rather than just another entertainment
story.</P>
<P>What really sets apart this film, is without a doubt, Brenda Blethyn, as
Cynthia, the mother who has had a daughter adopted, but has never really
dealt with her feelings in he matter. She is un-employed and a "victim" of
sorts of the system, in that she is un-educated, and pretty much out of the
realm of possibilities in life to learn a whole lot more. But while she is
in denial, her maternal instincts take over, and she befriends Hortense,
which adds a nice touch to the whole thing... the problem is how to break
years and years of lies to the rest of her family. Hortense has always been
a part of the truthful side of her life and feelings... the others have not.</P>
<P>Few films stand out for their knicks and knacks. If one is mostly interested
in catching adventure stories and fantasies, please avoid this film, so you
don't have to say anything not nice. If one appreciates the further
development of the acting styles, as an art form, few films will ever stand
up to this one. And fewer directors still will ever allow such great
freedoms to let the characters be who they are.</P>
<P>Quite worth seeing. Very well designed, even from a conceptual stand point.
The camera is mostly on hand, and staying with each character... and even
though it can be "pressing" it never "abuses" the character at all. It
allows for the character to have some space, something that even the likes
of Godard and Truffaut did not do. by comparison, they were very mechanical
in form, style and substance, if not eccentric.</P>
