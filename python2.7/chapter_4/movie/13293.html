<P>Light as cotton candy, breezy and utterly charming, "Billy's Hollywood 
Screen Kiss" is reminiscent of one of those fluffy, exuberant Rock 
Hudson/Doris Day romantic comedies from the 60's, except in this case 
Rock is out of the closet and Doris is a guy.</P>
<P>Despite working on a shoestring budget, Indianapolis filmmaker and I.U. 
grad Tommy O'Haver had the audacity to film "Billy" in a cinemascope 
screen ratio, and his ballsy move works. Beautifully framed and drenched 
in vivid colors, the wide screen production is truly handsome, enhancing 
the film's innocent, good-old-days feel.</P>
<P>O'Haver has created an unusually beguiling hybrid of 90's sensibilities 
and 60's panache, as he examines the intricacies, absurdities and 
heartbreaks of the dating ritual. Although gays will especially 
appreciate his romantic observations, heterosexual audiences should also 
be receptive to the gentle truths about the human condition presented 
here.</P>
<P>Billy Collier is an up and coming photographer in the ultra-trendy L.A. 
art world. While working on a new photo project, recreating great screen 
kisses from Hollywood's Golden Age with an all-male/drag cast, and 
stumbling through the dating scene, he meets Gabriel, a great-looking 
coffee house waiter. Billy recruits him as a model, and the two build a 
friendship complicated by Billy's growing infatuation for Gabriel and 
Gabriel's confusion over his sexual orientation. Is Gabriel straight, gay 
or bi? More importantly, does he care as much for Billy as Billy cares 
for him, or is our young hero doomed to suffer the indignities of 
unrequited love?</P>
<P>Regardless of orientation, we've all been down that road. We've all tried 
to take things slow, because it's the sensible thing to do, while our 
hearts demand that we dive in the deep end of the romantic pool. We've 
all spent hours waiting for a phone call from that special someone, even 
while knowing the foolishness of such behavior. We've all tried valiantly 
to let things flow naturally, fighting that insidious impulse to 
manipulate situations to meet our romantic agenda.</P>
<P>And what gay man hasn't spent a sleepless night laying by a "platonic" 
buddy, hoping he'll roll over and plant a big Hollywood screen kiss on 
his lips? "Billy" captures all of that romantic torture, without ever 
falling into pathos or losing its sprightly spirit.</P>
<P>Thank O'Haver's ingenious script for that. Crisp and clever, his dialogue 
has the easy wit and insight of early Woody Allen relationship comedies, 
without any of the creepy undertones.</P>
<P>The actors do justice to O'Haver's words, with Sean P. Hayes a delight as 
Billy, the all-American kid just looking for love. Hayes hits all the 
right notes, balancing puppy-dog innocence with brains and style. Billy 
knows that he probably will get hurt, but he just can't resist Gabriel's 
beauty and charm. </P>
<P>Brad Rowe, a Brad Pitt look-a-like who joined the cast of "NewsRadio" 
late last season, is very effective as Gabriel, deftly creating a 
character who is a bit dim and shallow, but utterly genuine. In lesser 
hands, Gabriel could easily have been just a himbo, but Rowe invests the 
character with enough substance that we understand why Billy is drawn to 
his spirit as well as his body.</P>
<P>The supporting cast is strong as well, with Meredith Scott Lynn a stand-
out as George, Billy's confidant and ersatz big sister. Armando Valdes-
Kennedy also scores as a Latin lover who just can't stop telling Billy 
how "special" he is.</P>
<P>With a drag trio popping up from time to time as the film's Greek chorus 
and several inventive dream sequences, "Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss" 
maintains a cheery, unpretentious tone, playing like a gay "Gidget" while 
gently dealing with the temptations and trauma of romance. The film was a 
big hit at last years Sundance Festival with good reason. O'Haver has 
spun a rich, entertaining confection, a gay film that manages to be 
mainstream without compromising itself. Now that's something to be out 
and proud about.</P>
