SWINGERS
Review By David Wilcock (C)1998</PRE>
<P>Running Time: 90 minutes (1 hour 30 minutes)
Starring Jon Favreau, Vince Vaughn and Heather Graham
 Directed By Doug Liman</P>
<P>Another 'independent film', this comedy, which was brought by Miramax
for $5 million, is good fun. Favreau and Vaughn (The Lost World:
Jurassic Park, 1997) play Mike and Trent, two everyday 20somethings on
the lookout for women. The film just basically follows their plight on
the lookout for lurve, and along the way we get to meet some of their
friends, see their attempts at chatting up girls, and just basically
get a insight into their lives. And all of this is great fun.</P>
<P>Swingers doesn't rely on huge special effects, or big name stars to
provide entertainment. No, it just has a great script and superb
little known actors. The script, by Favreau, is great. Mike is always
missing is girlfriend, who hasn't called him for six months, and every
time he meets a girl, he always end up telling her about the ex. The
audience feels for this pathetic little man, thanks to the great
script. Vaughn is 'the money' (Swingers speak for 'the best') as the
womanizing Trent, always on the lookout for a new girl. Some of his
chat-up lines are awful, but he always seems to get the girl thanks to
his 'hard man' nature.  Vaughns character also gets the best laugh in
the film, towards the end in a diner. The conversations that go on
between Mike and Trent are great, but it never quite reaches Tarantino
standards (which I suspect the film was trying to reach.) There are
some excellent, laugh out loud jokes in the film, and some superbly
funny set pieces (such as Favreau cringe-worhy battle with a answer
machine that always cut him off before he finishes his
sentence. Embarrassing to him, hilarious to the audience.)</P>
<P>Mike & Trents friends are also good, although there characters seem a
bit underwritten, and we never really learn as much as we would like
about them. Although this is primarily Mike and Trents film, it would
of been nice to learn a bit more about their friends. They just seem
to wander aimlessly in the background. But again, the lines they say
are usually pretty good, and they do have some funny parts. It's just
a shame that they didn't have more meatier roles.</P>
<P>The acting is superb. As said above, Vaughn is superb as Trent, he's
definitely the best thing in the film. Favreau is also good, acting as
'the little man' very well, and the way he always feels sorry for
himself is very funny. Graham (Boogie Nights, 1997) has a small but
good role as Lorraine, a girl Mike finally falls in love with. She
hardly features in the film at all, but she still manages to make an
impact on the audience.</P>
<P>Swingers, then, is funny, but it does have some flaws. Firstly, the
running time is a bit too short. The film comes to an abrupt halt, and
I actually wanted the film to carry on longer. It never really comes
to a satisfying conclusion, which is a shame, as most films are too
long! Also, this type of film has been done too many times, such as
Sleep with Me (1994). But these small flaws don't really spoil what is
a funny, entertaining comedy.</P>
<PRE>OVERALL RATING: **** out of ***** (4 out of 5)
