<P>CRUEL INTENTIONS
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: *** (out of ****)
Columbia / 1:36 / 1999 / R (language, sexual dialogue/situations, 
fleeting violence, brief nudity, drugs)
Cast: Ryan Phillippe; Sarah Michelle Gellar; Reese Witherspoon; Selma 
Blair; Christine Baranski; Joshua Jackson; Sean Patrick Thomas; Louise 
Fletcher; Eric Mabius; Swoosie Kurtz; Tara Reid 
Director: Roger Kumble 
Screenplay: Roger Kumble<HR>Fans of "Buffy" might get huffy while watching their beloved Sarah 
Michelle Gellar maneuver her way through the wickedly entertaining 
"Cruel Intentions." Gellar's a vamp instead of a vampire slayer here, so 
anybody expecting that she'll further her role model status with this 
big-screen lead is going to keel over from the shock. In "Cruel," she 
lies, connives, manipulates, seduces people of both genders and snorts 
coke from a crucifix-shaped vial. Imagine a junior version of Sharon 
Stone's "Basic Instinct" manipulator (only without the icepick murders), 
and you'll have a good idea of how bad this girl can be. </P>
<P>A contempo update of the malicious goings-on in Choderlos De Laclos' 
1782 novel "Les Liaisons Dangereuses," also the basis of the 1987 Glenn 
Close-John Malkovich dazzler "Dangerous Liaisons," "Cruel Intentions" 
substitutes the aristocratic France setting with a posh New York 
boarding school on summer break. It retains the deliciously 
agenda-minded characters, however, because the teens of today can 
presumably be as vicious as the patricians of yesteryear. Buying this is 
a bit of a stretch, if somewhat vital to immerse yourself in the film's 
warped atmosphere - exaggeration has never been so enjoyable. </P>
<P>Gellar's Kathryn and stepbrother Sebastian (Ryan Phillippe, her co-star 
previously in "I Know What You Did Last Summer") are so bored with their 
very blue-blooded existence that they've taken it upon themselves to 
bring down everyone who crosses them - and even a few who haven't. 
Kathryn's current project concerns sexually soiling the naive new 
girlfriend (Selma Blair, from TV's "Zoe, Duncan, Jack & Jane") of her 
ex-squeeze, a task Sebastian isn't up to because it's far too easy for 
his extensive debauching talents. Oh, well. Guess she'll just have to 
initiate the corruption herself. </P>
<P>He, meanwhile, is far more taken with the headmaster's daughter 
("Pleasantville"'s Reese Witherspoon), mostly because she wrote an 
article for "Seventeen" about her bold (well, for this day and age) 
decision to stay abstinent until marriage. Sebastian and Kathryn, then, 
see this as an opportunity for a little pseudo-incestuous wager over 
whether or not he can rip her of her innocence: If Kathryn wins, she 
gets his hot 1956 Jag. If he wins, he gets her - in the Biblical sense. 
"I'll let you put it _anywhere_," Kathryn not-quite-demurely purrs, 
which pretty much cements the deal for Sebastian. </P>
<P>"Cruel Intentions" eventually covers some iffy terrain when real-life 
couple Phillippe and Witherspoon actually warm to each other after 
initially rocky introductions; his charismatic but necessarily 
stone-cold portrayal makes their rushed courtship a little hard to 
totally buy, while it's difficult to comprehend why someone so smart and 
determined as she could ever fall for a smooth operator like him. If 
this were the only storyline, "Intentions" would be in trouble. But it's 
not - the subplots have subplots, which, in turn, have subplots still 
(some of them iffy as well). It's a complex tale, but one in which even 
the corners are dressed with delicious trappings. </P>
<P>Gellar's icy hauteur is chief among them, but she's got some serious 
competition from WB network co-actress Blair. The latter steals the 
movie with her giddily self-depreciating demeanor, and gets to share a 
racy scene with Gellar destined to go down as an audience favorite - at 
least for the males. Witherspoon is fine, too, wisely making her part's 
lifestyle choice neither sanctimonious nor self-congratulatory. And 
director/writer Roger Kumble hardly misses a beat as far as the smirky 
tone is concerned, from the opening sequences of one-upmanship to the 
guaranteed closing comeuppance. </P>
<P>Kumble is also successful with style and locale. The sumptuous 
production design - posh bedrooms, blush poolsides - is as sensual as 
any of the lead performers, the cinematography crisp and darkly 
colorful, and the subdued rock soundtrack - available, ironically, on 
Virgin Records - only furthers "Cruel Intentions" satiny ambience. (The 
score, however, just isn't on par, with some annoying techno loop 
constantly in the background.) Nothing, however, overpowers the games 
these people play, nasty and naughty though they may be. For a movie 
with its intentions mostly in the right place, "Intentions" is cruel but 
cool.<HR>© 1999 Jamie Peck

"‘20 Dates' tells the story of Myles Berkowitz, a man who wants to make 
a film, and to fall in love. These areas are his ‘two greatest failures, 
professional and personal,' so he decides to make a film about going out 
on 20 dates. By the film's end, he has won the love of the lovely 
Elisabeth - maybe - but his professional life is obviously still a 
failure." -Roger Ebert on "20 Dates"</P>
