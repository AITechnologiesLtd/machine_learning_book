<PRE>                               THE ADVOCATE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Even before the opening titles and credits are completed we knew
we were in for something more ribald than even a Boccaccio would have
dared.  Based on documents and court records circa 1450, THE ADVOCATE
relates the story of a young, handsome, dashing lawyer, Richard
Courtois, (Colin Firth) who leaves Paris to travel the countryside and
help the people who lead more simple lives and whose problems are of a
different nature than those to which he has been accustomed.  How
different they are astonish not only him but will shock you as well.</P>
<P>     Superstition in the countryside is the norm.  Between the powerful
Roman Catholic Church and the feudal noblemen of the time, and the
simple-minded folklore of the citizenry, life here is far, far
different than in Paris.  When a band of Gypsies arrives from Africa
they are greeted with hostility and fear.  Among the new arrivals is
the smokily sultry Samira (Amina Annabi) with whom Courtois falls in
love.  When she runs afoul of the ludicrous laws of the town, it is he
who takes her case to fight the prosecutor, (Donald Pleasance) who, in
fact, is but a lackey of the local landowner, the Seigneur.</P>
<P>     In this strange setting is the beautiful Filette, (Lysette
Anthony) the not-right-in the head daughter of the Seigneur, the result
of years of in-breeding.  There is the priest, Albertus (Ian Holm),
who knows right from wrong, and befriends the Advocate ... but  is
careful not to overstep himself because he would lose his power over
his flock.  The Seigneur is played by Nicol Williamson with a nice
haughty manner as befits a Lord who runs the town.</P>
