<P>"O.S.S." is a competent spy drama, set during World War II.
Alan Ladd stars as an American agent operating in France,
trying to obtain information about German troop movements.
The O.S.S. is the Office of Strategic Services, a CIA
predecessor.  While workmanlike in its story developments,
and with Ladd surprisingly dislikable (although credible)
in the lead role, the film has good script and direction,
and plenty of action and suspense.</P>
<P>Ladd and other future O.S.S. agents are first seen
being trained in the U.S.  Ladd's fellow spies include
sculpter Geraldine Fitzgerald, friendly hockey player
Richard Benedict, and middle aged and uneffacing
Don Beddoe.</P>
<P>Proud nazi officer John Hoyt falls for Fitzgerald, who
uses him to plant plastic explosives in a bust, sabotaging
a train.  Hoyt survives, and spends the rest of the film
hunting her down.  Meanwhile, O.S.S. activities are
aided by a greedy German traitor (Harold Vermilyea)
and a successful plant in the German Army (Richard Webb).</P>
<P>Predictable, the relationship between Ladd and
Fitzgerald is a plot focus.  Ladd is initially
chauvinistic, but Fitzgerald's field successes
change his mind.  Benedict also gets a love interest,
with his unseen contact Gloria Saunders.</P>
<P>The American agents are heroic, ready to sacrifice
their lives if necessary for the cause of Allied victory.
Not surpringly, the Germans don't come off as well.
Both Hoyt and Vermilyea put selfish interests first.
When Ladd is getting a beating in a later scene, a group
of German soldiers is shown drunken and approving.</P>
