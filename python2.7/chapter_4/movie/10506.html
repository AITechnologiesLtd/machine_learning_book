<P>Scream  ***1/2  (out of four)
R, 1996
Directed by Wes Craven. Written by Kevin Williamson.
Starring Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette.</P>
<P>"Do you like scary movies?" asks an exaggeratedly sinister voice over the
telephone, and with that, "Scream" is off and running. The bizarre phone
conversation between this unnamed voice and Drew Barrymore continues as the
caller runs down horror movie cliches. ("I am one second away from calling the
police!" says Barrymore as the call takes a threatening turn. "But they never
get there in time," the caller responds coolly.) Finally, she is challenged to
play a  game in which she has to answer trivia questions about horror movies.
If she gets them right, she lives. If not, she dies.</P>
<P>Despite the gruesome conclusion that this scene eventually reaches, "Scream"
is really more of a camp sendup than anything else. What makes it work better
than most spoofs, and helps it to establish at least some amount of suspense,
is that the script is never quite aware of itself. It manages to pull this off
with the clever premise that the characters, mostly teenagers, are all
familiar with the traditions and cliches of horror movies. In the James Bond
parody "Austin Powers," for example, the villain purposely engages in the
action movie cliche of giving his captives an excessive amount of time to
escape. But he doesn't do this because he's been watching James Bond movies;
he does it because he's a character in a spoof. "Scream" pushes the envelope a
little farther, even going so far as to have one character insist, "But this
is real life, this isn't a movie!" while never giving the game away and
admitting that it is, in fact, a movie.</P>
<P>The main character in "Scream" is Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), a high
school student who seems to be the killer's next intended victim after she
receives a similar phone call ("The question isn't, 'Who am I?' The question
is, 'WHERE . . . AM I?'") but escapes an assault by someone dressed in a
dopey-looking "ghost-face" costume with a black robe. Among the suspects are
her boyfriend Billy, his friend Stu, local horror film geek Randy, and her
father, who has gone missing. The combination works best in the second half of
the film, when many of the teenage characters gather at Stu's house for a
party and the killer makes an appearance.</P>
<P>Aside from the mystery, "Scream" boasts some moments of deranged comic
inspiration to rival many recent comedies. Some of the best lines come from
Randy, who is always at hand to offer observations about how the situation
parallels that of a particular horror movie (perhaps one of those "Wes
Carpenter flicks," as one girl speculates), or, in one of the best scenes, a
lecture about the rules that a character must follow to survive a horror
movie. (In case you're wondering - never have sex, never drink or do drugs,
and never, EVER, under any circumstances, say, "I'll be right back.")  Kevin
Williamson's script is also smart enough to toss in plenty of humor that is
not directly related to slasher films, such as the weird dialogue between two
characters on a Romantic Evening Walk. ("Do you know what constellation that
is up there?" "No, which one?" "I don't know, that's why I was asking you.")</P>
<P>"Scream" reminded me a lot of the 1985 film "Clue" in the way it developed as
a fun, irreverent mystery-comedy. The only problem is that director Wes
Craven, a horror veteran, seems to want this to be scarier than it actually
is. A few of the killer's attacks, especially the murder of Barrymore's
character, made for genuine suspense, but most were surrounded by so much
tongue-in-cheek dialogue that I was too busy laughing to be scared by
anything. There is some general suspense of the who-will-live and who-will-die
variety, but no more so than in any action thriller, and certainly none of the
cold-blooded fear that horror movies are (I guess) supposed to inspire.</P>
<P>There has been a lot of talk about "Scream" as a landmark for the horror
genre, but other than a few scenes and Craven's name in the credits, there
really isn't that much to qualify it as a horror movie - at least not an
especially good one, in any case. Fortunately, there's enough campy humor for
it to earn a well-deserved place as a cult classic, and one that, ironically
enough, will probably be watched by teenagers at parties for years to come.</P>
