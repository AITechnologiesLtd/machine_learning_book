<P>   A few blocks from where I live is a farmers' market. 
Growers come in from upstate New York twice a week, and
on Saturday morning one such family parks a van housing a
couple of goats, a pig, and a rabbit.  This family makes
money on the deal by situating a collection box outside the
truck with a sign, "If you want us to continue coming here
with the animals, please contribute."  The little kids love to
come up to the cage and pet the goats and the pig.  One six-
year-old asked the farmer about the man's "pets," but was
told that only the rabbit was for companionship.  The others
would "go to market."  The kid seemed to accept that answer
without asking further.</P>
<P>   Now, I wish that little boy and others like him could see "All
the Little Animals," a poignant, sometimes tense and violent
fable about a 24-year-old emotionally-challenged man living
in London with his abusive stepfather. Here is a fellow who
had never left home since he was somewhat brain-damaged
in an auto accident years back but who decides in a moment
of great anxiety to flee from his London home to the wholly
unfamiliar Cornwall countryside.  He finds his identity there
while experiencing one particularly strained encounter of
life-or-death proportions.  The movie is not a great one but is
an appropriate choice for its presumed target of little ones as
it more or less follows the pattern of classic fairy tales.  </P>
<P>   In this fable, Bobby (Christian Bale), having experienced
the death of his beloved mom, is pressured by his sinister
stepfather De Winter (Daniel ali) to sign over his
mother's large London department store on pain of being
committed for life to a hospital for the disturbed.  Bobby
sneaks out of the house, hitches a ride to Cornwall, and
bonds with a people-hating hermit, Mr. Summers (John Hurt). 
Summers, who burns with fury at automobile drivers because
their speeding vehicles kill scores of road animals daily,
believes that all animals have an equal right to life as people-
-including mice, rats, roaches and moths.  Financially
independent, Summers makes a career of giving proper
burials to the hapless creatures who litter the highways but
don't go anywhere.</P>
<P>   The chemistry between Bale and Summers is credible
enough. They are two of a kind, both products of an abusive
society, with Summers a natural mentor for the unhappy
young man who had been patronized at best for most of us
24 years. John Hurt, whose piquant role as a stodgy British
writer in "Love and Death on Long Island" should have
earned him an Oscar, is made up to look ten years older and
who displays the gruff exterior so unknown to the love-sick
Giles De'Ath in the remarkable 1997 movie.  Jeremy
Thomas's direction is particularly reliable in the depiction of
De Winter, who never raises his voice, who listens attentively
and does not lecture, but who in the final analysis is bent on
murder for its own sake.</P>
<P>   I'd compare the trajectory of "All the Little Animals" to that
of "The Wizard of Oz," in which Bobby (substituting for
Dorothy) winds up in Cornwall (substituting for Oz) after
fleeing his stepdad (the Wicked Witch of the West) and is
mentored by a flawed but well-meaning recluse (the Wizard). 
Very young children might be disturbed by the scenes of
violence and tension (one person's neck is slit on screen, and
gravesites are being prepared graphically).  If you can allow
for one irrational and unbelievable scene involving Bobby and
Summers' trip to London, you're left with a decent, small-
scale movie, perhaps more suitable for video than the large
screen.</P>
