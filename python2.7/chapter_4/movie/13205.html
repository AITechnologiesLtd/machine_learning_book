<PRE>A PERFECT MURDER (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Cher Johnson

<P>With a name like A Perfect Murder, a movie has a lot to live up to. Is A
Perfect Murder perfect?</P>
<P>Stephen Taylor (Michael Douglas) is a big money mover who is married to
Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow), the daughter of a rich family. Emily is having an
affair with a grimy looking painter, David (Viggo Mortenson). </P>
<P>The questions posed by the script are: Does Emily's husband know about the
affair? What would he do if he found out? How long can the affair last? And
is it really love that David is searching for?</P>
<P>If you have seen the previews for A Perfect Murder, you'll know that
Emily's husband does find out and he wants Emily dead. He plans the
"perfect murder" in which David is the killer. The plan is foolproof -- or
is it?</P>
<P>The plot unfolds slowly and is deliciously evil. Which makes the ending
feel somewhat like a cheat.</P>
<P>Director Andrew Davis (The Fugitive) tries to redeem himself here after his
horrible Chain Reaction. And Davis does an admirable job with A Perfect
Murder -- though, it never reaches the heights that his The Fugitive did.</P>
<P>The look of the film is engrossing with its high contrast lighting. This
has been done before and better -- look at Douglas's last film, The Game,
for this.</P>
<P>Performance-wise the best comes from Viggo Mortensen. Mortensen is one of
the most underrated and underused actors in Hollywood -- this is a shame
because Mortensen is a versatile and talented actor. If you've never seen
Mortensen, check out Crimson Tide and G.I. Jane also.</P>
<P>If Gwyneth Paltrow's Sliding Doors character had a third story line, A
Perfect Murder would have been it. Paltrow does nothing new here. Following
in Paltrow's footsteps, Douglas is not doing anything either. Douglas
almost seems like he didn't leave the set of his last film, The Game.</P>
<P>Paltrow and Douglas's lack in the performance arena doesn't hurt the film
at all though. The script is well written enough to make us overlook these
flaws.</P>
<P>One performance to look for is David Suchet as the head police
investigator. His part is small, but he makes a good impression.</P>
<P>Overall, I really liked A Perfect Murder and I recommend it. The film is
not a perfect murder, but it is still quite a good killing.</P>
