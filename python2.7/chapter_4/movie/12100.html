<P>People who think Hollywood should stay away from sequels are most
definitely going to use MAJOR LEAGUE: BACK TO THE MINORS as ammunition
for their case. There are very few movies that can survive the sophomore
jinx, let alone become franchises that sprawl out to three or four or
even five movies. ROCKY, BATMAN, ALIEN, and LETHAL WEAPON are all
enjoyable movies that have now spawned at least three less-than-
enjoyable follow-ups, and in the case of ROCKY, we did have to sit
through Stallone's stinker of a fifth episode (although the point might
be made that it capped the series off). Hopefully, though, MAJOR LEAGUE
3's dismal appearance will warrant a cut-off for the series, as an
outing like this does not deserve to be repeated. </P>
<P>There is little to like about the bad humor and dismal cast that
cultivates MAJOR LEAGUE 3. Only three members of the original cast
haven't nixed the franchise by this episode, and the title character is
fresh meat. Scott Bakula (from a more enjoyable sports comedy, Necessary
Roughness) plays Gus Cantrell, a minor league baseball player who, on
the verge of retirement, takes the option from Roger Dorn (Corbin
Bernsen) to manage a triple-A team in the Minnesota Twins' organization
called the Buzz. Predictably, at the movie's outset, the group is a
bumbling gaggle of klutzes that fight amongst themselves and boggle
routine plays. And predictably, with Gus' help, they become a top-notch
farm team. The climax of the movie comes with a bet between Gus and
Leonard Huff (Ted McGinley), the manager of the Twins, that pits the
Buzz against the Twins. </P>
<P>Bob Uecker as Harry Doyle, the vulgar announcer, and Dennis Haysbert as
the intimdating Cuban batsman Pedro Cerrano, are the other two cast
members (along with Bernsen) to make it back. Also returning from the
second movie is Takaaki Ishibashi, although those three characters have
lost their novelty and don't lend much to the movie's story. Even
Uecker, usually funny, has lost a lot of his idiosyncrasies for the sake
of a PG-13 rating: his drunken abandon is replaced with dry humor that
loses appeal quickly. Bakula is decent as Buzz manager Cantrell,
although his attempt at middle-aged wisdom doesn't lend itself to the
audience the way Tom Berringer's did for the first movie. Bernsen, too,
as Dorn, has lost his appeal, and Jensen Daggett (from FRIDAY THE 13TH
PART VIII - now that's sequel overkill), who plays Gus' fiancee Maggie,
is good-looking onscreen but either underused in the script or just
pointless. </P>
<P>Sports comedies are drastically in decline, and that may correlate to
the declining stability of professional sports. Laughable gems like
MAJOR LEAGUE don't deserve to be ruined by poor sequels, and even though
Warner Brothers may not have realized it prior to their distribution of
the third episode, they may after it brings in poor box office receipts.
Although CITY OF ANGELS was a diamond in the rough for the film company,
they haven't had a box-office smash in seven months. MAJOR LEAGUE: BACK
TO THE MINORS is definitely missable, for just about every person and
for just about any other movie.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "MAJOR LEAGUE 3": 0.5 stars - a very poor movie.</P>
