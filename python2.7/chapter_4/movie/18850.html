<PRE>THE MATRIX
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR></PRE>
<P>Rating: **1/2 (out of ****)
Warner Bros. / 2:16 / 1999 / R (language, violence, icky sci-fi goo)
Cast: Keanu Reeves; Laurence Fishburne; Carrie-Anne Moss; Joe
Pantoliano; Hugo Weaving; Julian Arahanga
Director: Andy Wachowski; Larry Wachowski
Screenplay: Andy Wachowski; Larry Wachowski<HR></P>
<P>Keanu Reeves as an alleged Chosen One destined to liberate the enslaved
human race of a grungy futuristic setting instantly sounds like a bad
idea to end all bad ideas - it's Ted "Theodore" Logan as Mad Moses
Beyond Thunderdome! Any film capable of mining a casting coup out of
this ripe-for-ridicule synopsis, however, promises to take a lot of
people by surprise, and that's just what "The Matrix" will presumably do
with Reeves and still more adventurous elements. While watching "The
Matrix," the pulse is quickened, the eyes are dazzled and the brain is
twisted beyond recognition several times over.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, this is also a movie that isn't as deep as it sometimes
pretends to be, pleases viscerally more often than mentally and sports
murky concepts up the wazoo. The latter flaw definitely detracts from
the viewing experience, as important and much-needed exposition arrives
in sudden bursts of dialogue too thick to take in all at once - even
this typically story-savvy critic was left gasping for air (or at least
a rewind button) in certain places. But is it really fair to criticize a
film that boasts the imagination to create and continually play by its
own rules? Maybe not.</P>
<P>"The Matrix" provides a great deal of intrigue in early moments, where
Reeves' computer expert Neo slips into panic mode after being contacted
by a group of underground hackers lead by shady types Morpheus (Laurence
Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). They freak him out with
several disturbing bombshells - among them, 1999 is not 1999
(definitely), reality is an illusion created by malevolent robots that
have enslaved the world populace for battery power (probably), and Neo
is the dude who shall deliver us (possibly). Reeves' dazed, fazed and
generally endearing demeanor works for him in this role.</P>
<P>Before long, Morpheus begins playing Yoda to Neo' Luke Skywalker,
training him with a literal interpretation of the En Vogue dance hit
"Free Your Mind" - do so and almost any physical feat is possible in
this falsified universe (with the right computer upload, of course).
Wanna learn jujitsu? Done. Wanna be able to vault from skyscraper to
skyscraper in a lone leap? _Voila_. These sequences make for some
genuinely exhilarating moments - namely a hand-to-hand match between
Reeves and Fishburne that starts off in silly fight stances and finishes
up with spectacular gravity-defying choreography.</P>
<P>Then comes the empty midsection, which would be a downright snooze if it
weren't so hole-riddled and confusing. Not only are most of the weird
explanatory bits forcefully spewed forth here, the thrills take an
ill-fated detour with several head-scratching sidetracks involving a
half-baked act of mutiny and a supremely strange visit to an all-knowing
entity known as the Oracle. Brothers Andy and Larry Wachowski,
co-scribes and -directors here, seem guilty of both over- and
underwriting in these hazy passages, but their handling of most other
material is pitch-perfect.</P>
<P>"The Matrix" isn't so weak as to be labeled a sophomore slump for those
creative Wachowski boys, though 1996's nifty crime-drama "Bound," their
feature film debut, came together more cohesively. Even if their second
act doesn't live up to its awe-inspiring bookends, give them credit for
regaining footing for a sensational final half-hour that finds Reeves
and company infiltrating enemy headquarters and unleashing the Force -
or whatever it's called - to the fullest. This includes further unique
special effects like enabling the actors to run across walls and limbo
under slow-motion bullet trails.</P>
<P>When it sticks to incomparable tricks and treats like these, "The
Matrix" is deeply cool - perhaps enough to catch again if you're sure
the narrative will flow better. In other words, the likelihood of
running commentary by the Wachowskis addressing the huhs of the plot, as
well as other behind-the-scenes extras answering the technical-related
hows, on "The Matrix"'s sure-to-be-upcoming DVD release might be too
good to pass on, even for those who don't find the movie very
user-friendly.<HR></P>

"The best possible argument for including [a shot of Bruce] Willis'
genitals would have been that the movie, after all, contains everything
else." -Roger Ebert on "Color of Night"</P>
