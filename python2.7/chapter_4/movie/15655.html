<PRE>Review:                LOVE IS THE DEVIL</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:        Derek Jacobi, Daniel Craig, Tilda Swinton, Anne Lambton
                Adrian Scarborough, Karl Johnson, Annabel Brooks</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by:        John Maybury</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse</PRE>
<P>This is definitely an Art film, but the art is missing.  Although the
pivotal character of the movie is the renowned artist, Francis Bacon, his
estate refused to allow his work to be shown.  Instead, we are presented
with scenes showing the works during creation.</P>
<P>Derek Jacobi stars as the controversial artist, and he does an admirable
job in showing the many facets of the man's life.  Daniel Craig portrays
George Dyer, Bacon's model and lover.</P>
<P>This is a very heavy film dealing with sadism, masochism, homosexuality,
power, control, and despair.  The pain in Bacon's soul is the basis of his
art.  Although the acting and the production of the film well done, and
the subject is well represented, it is not recommended for the general
public.  Perhaps this is why the release date kept being postponed, week
after week.  Finally, it is in theaters, but only for a limited run.</P>
<PRE>I have no desire to ever see this movie again.  I give it a C-.</PRE>
<PRE>SEE YOU AT THE MOVIES.</PRE>
