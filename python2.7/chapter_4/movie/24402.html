<PRE>KIKUJIRO
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Takeshi Kitano, famous for his Dirty Harry style parts in Japanese crime
dramas such as FIREWORKS, tries a change of pace in the corny comedy
KIKUJIRO, in which he stars, directs, writes and edits.  (His
traditionally violent character, however, seems just below the surface.
Although he spends most of the story acting like a corked volcano, he
does explode once, beating an old man to a pulp in order to teach him a
lesson.)</P>
<P>Like a B-movie for kids, the comedy never got a laugh from this critic,
but it was certainly cheesy enough for my audience, filled with high
school students.  They laughed loudly, especially at its shamelessly
slapstick concluding segment.</P>
<P>Essentially a road picture, KIKUJIRO is divided into chapters introduced
by cutesy, moving postcards with titles such as "Mister Played with Me."
The story concerns a sad and lonely, latchkey 9-year-old, Masao (Yusuke
Sekiguchi), who lives with his working grandmother.  She tells him that
his father is dead and his mother lives far away.  Masao, who rarely
smiles or talks, wants to find his mother.  His older friend, Kikujiro
Takeda (Takeshi Kitano), decides to take him to locate his mother.  They
hitch a series of rides, most of which end up dumping them along the
highway in the middle of nowhere.</P>
<P>Along the way, Kikujiro mugs constantly, trying to get a laugh out of
the boy and us.  In order to stop a car to catch a ride, Kikujiro makes
like a blind man who just failed a suicide attempt by overdosing on
caffeine.  As he bounces into objects, and they into him, he finally
gets a car to stop.  When he forgets that he can't see -- one of the
film's many recycled jokes -- the truck driver leaves them stranded.</P>
<P>Continuing in the replay of old comedy routines, Kikujiro tries without
success to juggle three oranges.  Guess what?  He can keep two going.
Funny, huh?</P>
<P>The one complete satisfying part of the production is Jô Hisaishi's
music.  Playfully happy, it suggests a more light-hearted and better
movie than KIKUJIRO.</P>
<P>The movie's most troubling scene concerns an incidence of pedophilia.
An old man in a dark park lures Masao into the bushes in order to have
oral sex with him.  As the man kneels in front of Masao, pulling down
his underwear, Kikujiro saves the little boy.  The entire episode, even
if the movie tries to make it humorous, has no business being there.  I
found this scene sickening and in bad taste.  In contrast, the rest of
the film had the taste of leftover food, badly in need of some fresh
seasoning,</P>
<P>KIKUJIRO runs 1:56.  The film is in Japanese with English subtitles.  It
is rated PG-13 for a threatening incident and would be acceptable for
older teenagers.</P>
