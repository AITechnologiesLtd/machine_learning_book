The Naked Spur (Reviewed on Aug. 24th/98)</PRE>
<PRE>Starring Jimmy Stewart</PRE>
<P>Is Jimmy Stewart the greatest actor of all-time?  It's quite possible. 
His career spanned over 40 years, and he acted in more movies than most
actors ever could.  Yet, when he is talked about in the media, he is
generally thought of as an actor who played one type of role: the nice
guy.  And that's really a shame.  "The Naked Spur" features Jimmy Stewart
in a role completely different than what people would expect from him.</P>
<P>It's a western, which Stewart specialized in around this period, and it
casts him as a desperate man out to collect a bounty on a man who used to
be his friend.  Before he finds that man, though, he runs into two men who
agree to help him, thinking he is a Sheriff.  When the criminal is
eventually caught, the two men discover Stewart's secret, and decide they
want a piece of the action too.  The rest of the film is a suspenseful
journey in which each man suspects the other constantly.</P>
<P>Also featured is the woman travelling with the criminal, well played by
Janet Leigh.  We're never too sure who's side she's really on until the
end.  Leigh is an actress probably best known for her role as the "shower
lady" from "Psycho", and that's unfair.  She gives a strong performance as
a woman who is pulled between these two men.</P>
<P>Stewart gives a performance unlike anything I've ever seen from him.  He
usually keeps cool no matter what occurs, but here, he gets downright
hysterical at times.  I think perhaps he took this role to prove to the
public that he was more than just a "nice guy".  His performance borders
on psychotic at times, but I loved watching every second of it.  It's
roles like this one that make me admire him as much as I do.  He was an
actor unafraid to take chances, and even ruin his public image.</P>
<PRE>He truly was a great American actor.</PRE>
<PRE>*** out of ****</PRE>
