<PRE>A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>When I saw Croupier, there were no coming attractions. While I saw the movie in
a perfectly respectable Loews Cineplex theater with three screens, no studios
thought that their money would get put to good use by placing a trailer before
this film. This could be a sign that expectations were low in regard to how
much of an audience this movie would receive. More likely though, it's a sign
that little movies like these are often the best films out there. While some
smaller movies get the mainstream quota achieved by hits like Life Is
Beautiful, Being John Malkovich, and The Blair Witch Project there are others
that remain doomed to the film festival. Adopted by The Shooting Gallery as
their fifth film in this year's lineup of six, Croupier is an intense film noir
piece worthy of your attention. The scheduled two week run does shame to a
movie that should play for longer for all to see and experience.</P>
<P>Clive Owen plays Jack Manfred. Jack is a struggling writer who takes a job as a
croupier in a casino after his father suggests it to him. Jack is currently in
a relationship with Marion (McKee), who doesn't like his new job. Life as a
croupier is a depressing one. Jack watches people lose their money night after
night. Another croupier winds down after work with drinks at a local prostitute
heavy bar. â€œThe job will kill you if you donâ€™t.â€? he says. Even though
strict rules issued by the casino forbid it, Jack soon begins sleeping with a
co-worker named Bella (Hardie). Jack breaks another rule when he begins seeing
Jani de Villiers (Kingston), a gambler from South Africa who catches his
interest. He soon falls in love with her, but Jani has ulterior motives to
their relationship. She asks Jack to take part in a hiest to rob the casino,
offering him quite a deal of money to do so. </P>
<P>All the classic detective movie elements are here. There are many voice-overs,
there is a woman with a secret, and the characters smoke a lot and drink a lot.
Indeed everything needed is here but the detective. While Croupier is certainly
not a mystery, it does a brilliant job of almost turning itself into one in the
last few minutes. Questions we weren't really asking get answered, and it's a
nice touch to end the film with. Clive Owen is terrific as the lead character
and makes his sullen, emotionless view of the world an interesting outlook. You
have no doubt the casino he works in is real. The filmmakers did a remarkable
job of making you feel that somewhere this casino really does exist. Everything
seems so dark and gloomy in this world. At times, I felt black and white would
have been more appropriate to this movie than color. Either way, it would still
be thrilling. The lights, the noise, the people, everything that might annoy
one in a regular casino is here to set a unique atmosphere. The cheaters and
obsessive gamblers Jack encounters in the casino seemed to me a metaphor of the
characters in the movie. All of the them are trying to cheat at something or
are permanently downcast with nowhere to turn. Croupier is not rated. If
submitted, it would get rated R for sexual situations including graphic nudity,
language, and some violence. Several unneeded breasts are present. Then again,
maybe this too is a suggested way that gamblers escape from their troubles. Not
only is Croupier a high quality drama, but it made me think about what leads
people to become obsessive gamblers. The movie doesn't come up with an answer.
Then again, maybe there isn't one.</P>
