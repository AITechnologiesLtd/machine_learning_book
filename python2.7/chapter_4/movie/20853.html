<P>   How do you make the pathos of a film's characters seem
real?  Recently, Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier issued a
manifesto along with his introduction of "The Celebration,"
stating that the way to do this is to eliminate all notions of
illusion--no special effects, no filters on the cameras, no crass
editing.  Another method, more tried-and-true, is the
documentary, which selects actual scenes to portray a point
without fictionalizing. The weakness of the first is that such a
chaste approach relinquishes the incredible technology that
can add zest to the dullest tale.  The second is marred by an
over-reliance on talking-heads and by abdicating the merits of
storytelling.</P>
<P>   In "The City," four tales of Latin-American immigrants in the
U.S., director David Riker sidesteps the flaws of those
methods, keeping his story candid and forthright by using
mostly real people, not actors.  He allows them to dramatize
the hardships of the people they portray, problems centering
on their being disenfranchised people from Mexico and lands
south who are living in New York City.  Because many of
them are presumably undocumented aliens, they have
difficulties finding decent jobs, and those they do find can
barely keep the clothes on their backs, much less take care
of people who are dependent upon them both in New York
and in the home countries.</P>
<P>   "The City" is filmed by David Riker--a documentarian who
has successfully plied his trade with his first feature film--in a
black-and-white neo-realist style.  It's a stretch, but think of
the great Italian director Roberto Rosselini who in 1945
introduced neo-realism with "Open City," a devastating
depiction of the destruction wrought by World War II.  In
some scenes of Riker's work, particularly those filmed in the
Bronx, we get the impression that these working people are
in Dresden in 1945 and not in the world's greatest metropolis
between 1992 and 1997 when the work was filmed.</P>
<P>   The quartet of movies is unified by a photographer who is
taking photos of an assortment of Latinos amid a fake
background of sylvan scenes, a perfect irony for the lives that
these people are leading.  You won't find these folks jogging
or riding their bikes in the Central Park that forms the canvas
backdrop for the pictures, but you will locate them rather in
parts of the city that seem to many New Yorkers to be
invisible.</P>
<P>  The people hauling bricks in the first story, called "Bricks,"
are plying their simple trade against a backdrop of Manhattan
skyscrapers but they might as well be working on a Georgia
chain gang.  Desperate for this pack-mule work, they line up
outside hiring areas and are picked up selectively by men
with trucks, one of whom brusquely promises those who are
culled $50 a day, only to announce on arrival at a remote
location that they instead would be given only 15 cents for
each brick they stack in a pile.  When a wall collapses killing
a worker, the men do not even know where to direct the
ambulance.  They are in purgatory.  The story is acted
poignantly by one virtually voiceless professional in the role
of the contractor, Joe Rigano (you'll remember him from
"Mickey Blue-Eyes") and a crew of rugged laborers who
might do better if they could unite but who instead fight
among themselves in their frustration.</P>
<P>   The most heartwarming picture, the only one that gives
some hope of transcendence for these unfortunate people, is
"Home."  A young man from the city of Puebla, Mexico
(Cipriano Garcia) in New York for the first time fruitlessly tries
to locate his uncle's apartment.  When he cannot make sense
of the huge housing project, he hears music, slips into a
sweet 15 party, and dances with a sad young woman (Leticia
Herrera) who is at first cautious but soon warms up to the lad
when she discovers he lives in the same section of Puebla
from which she came.  Though the two seem to be falling in
love by the minute (she invites him to spend the night in her
apartment on the couch), the meeting turns out to be a
bittersweet one.</P>
<P>   In "The Puppeteer," a homeless man (Jose Rabelo) living
with his 7-year-old daughter (Stephanie Viruet) in a car is
unable to register the little girl in a public school since he
does not have a rent receipt of phone bill to prove residence
in the district. Frustrated that the lack of a piece of paper
could prevent his daughter from getting an education, he
becomes yet another of the invisible dispirited men who do
not cause trouble but who have fallen through the cracks.</P>
<P>   The story closes with the most highly-developed tale,
"Seamstress," in which a man who is himself an immigrant
(from the Far East, played by Hyoung Taek Limb) exploits the
labor of Latinos in a sweatshop.  When one of the workers
(Silvia Goiz) needs $400 for an emergency treatment of her
daughter, her fellow seamstresses and pressers--who must
work quickly and without errors lest they be instantly
dismissed--take up a meager collection.  The boss, who has
not paid the workers in a month, is pure Simon Legree,
however.</P>
<P>   David Riker, who has worked with various communities in
the New York area and comes across as a sympathetic and
even enraged ideologue with Old-Left politics, has filmed a
labor of love. While his movie will not likely have the effect on
New York's mayor and council that the Upton Sinclair had on
Congress with that writer's "The Jungle," Riker proves that
even the country's most liberal large city has a way to go to
prove its compassion.  This is an empathetic work filmed
effectively in the Italian neo-realist tradition.</P>
