<P>   When I was younger and wiser and dating girls who had
roommates, I was regularly amazed by how often these pairs
of best friends would split up prematurely.  The rate of
breakdowns of twenty-somethings during the 1960s exceeded
even the current frequency of divorce.  Does living together
ruin friendships?  In many cases this seems to be true.  To
get more insight into the enigma, take in Erick Zonca's
remarkably well-acted and poignant piece, "The Dreamlife of
Angels."  You'd not be at all surprised to know that this is the
work that closed last year's New York Film Festival, featured
not in the usual space but in the majestic and large Avery
Fisher Hall--home of the New York Philharmonic.</P>
<P>   The feature, which allowed the two principal performers to
take best-actress awards at Cannes, is not just a
heartbreaking story of two working-class women who are
barely of age.  It's a portrait of the lives of working-class
women who wile away their wage-earning hours in soul-killing
factory jobs, performing the same monotonous tasks hour
after hour.  This is the sort of film that should boost
enrollment in colleges: only through a decent education can
most young people avoid spirit-busting toil like that weathered
by Marie and her friend Isa, who share a common age and
occupation but who are psychologically very much different.  </P>
<P>   The movie opens in the Northern France town of Lille,
where Isa (Elodie Bouchez), an array of rucksacks on her
back, is peddling religious pictures on the street to make a
few francs.  She strikes up a conversation with a man in a
cafe who is the manager of a factory turning out dresses, and
is offered a job, where she becomes friendly with a fellow
seamstress, Marie (Natacha Regnier).  The two young
women flirt with a couple of bouncers at a club, Charly
(Patrick Mercado) and Fredo (Jo Prestia), and while Marie
enjoys a brief affair with Charly, she is soon both attracted
and repelled by the club's rich owner, Chriss (Gregoire Colin).
The arrogant Chriss smoothly and duplicitously convinces
Marie that he likes her, while Marie ignores her roommate's
counsel that the affair cannot last.</P>
<P>   "The Dreamlife of Angels" focuses equally on the two
young women, portraying the wandering Isa as surprisingly
stable and loving despite her homelessness, but the real
drama accelerates as Marie--already unstable--begins to go
off-the-wall.  She fights on the least provocation, becomes
seldom other than moody, and when her tenuous
relationships begin to fall apart, she becomes desperate.</P>
<P>   Hollywood films exploring the relationship between two
women tend to be overly melodramatic and violent--"Thelma
and Louise"--for example.  The beauty of Erick Zonca's
feature is the more natural performances he culls from two
gifted thesps who, according to the production notes, were
compelled to live together to get the feel of both the intimacy
and the quandary such closeness produces.  "The Dreamlife
of Angels" is a work of accomplished earthiness and sincerity.</P>
