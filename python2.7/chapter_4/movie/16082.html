<PRE>After Hours (1985)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 65</PRE>
<P>"After Hours" is a quirky black comedy.  It is an
endless series of events that don't completely make
sense, but the director (Martin Scorsese) plays it
straight, creating an ironic rather than surreal effect.</P>
<P>Griffin Dunne stars as an average guy who is trapped
late at night in the Soho section of New York.  Without
any friends or cash, he is dependent upon the generosity
of strangers.  Unfortunately for Griffin, everybody
he meets in Soho is eccentric, and his attempts to
go home place him in increasingly bizarre situations.</P>
<P>The film begins conventionally enough: Boy (Dunne)
meets Girl (Rosanna Arquette).  The first clue that
things are amiss is that Arquette's room-mate
(Linda Fiorentino) is a punk sculptress.  Arquette
apparently has burns on her body, and has curious
domestic troubles.  Dunne soon encounters burglers
Cheech and Chong, "beehive 1965" (Teri Garr), and
numerous homosexual characters.</P>
<P>The Academy Awards passed on "After Hours", but
Scorsese won Best Screenplay at the Cannes film festival.
I guess that it is a credit to the screenplay that
the film never loses its focus, considering that a half
hour story has become a 96 minute movie.  But Cannes may
have honored the film more for its feel than its quality.
Dunne's character becomes increasingly whiny, and
the actions of the characters often make little sense.
In particular, every female character that Dunne encounters
takes a strong interest in him.  If you are wondering
how Dunne came to be cast for the plum role, it probably
helped that he co-produced the film.</P>
<P>For Scorsese, best known for dramas starring Robert De Niro,
this was his second black comedy in a row, following
"The King of Comedy".</P>
