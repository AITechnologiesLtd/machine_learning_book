<P>_Love_&_Basketball_ (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>Film genres don't come more basic and predictable than the love story
and the sports movie.  Love story: soulmates run into countless,
sometimes trivial, obstacles en route to "happily ever after"; sports
movie: athletes must overcome physical and (mostly) mental hurdles to
achieve their crowning glory.  As one can glean from its no-frills title,
_Love_&_Basketball_ doesn't break much, if any, new ground within its
genres, but writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood approaches the formula
task with such intelligence and sincerity that it's petty to complain.</P>
<P>The most refreshing wrinkle to _Love_&_Basketball_ is its
straightforward treatment of women's sports, a subject that is rarely
covered without a special angle.  The female athlete here is Monica
Wright (Sanaa Lathan), a naturally gifted basketball player who continues
to grow and mature in her ability as she works her way up from the high
school ranks to the college ranks.  Following the same path, albeit in a
more flamboyant fashion, is her longtime neighbor Quincy McCall (Omar
Epps), son of NBA journeyman Zeke McCall (Dennis Haysbert) and a shooting
star in his own right.</P>
<P>_Love_&_Basketball_ is the story of two passions: Monica and Quincy's
passion for the game and also their passion for each other. 
Prince-Bythewood comes up with an ingenious way of melding these two
through the film's structure: like a basketball game, the film--and,
thus, the development of their relationship--is broken down into four
quarters  The two meet as 11-year-olds (played by Kyla Pratt and Glenndon
Chatman, respectively) in the first quarter (set in 1981), and after some
typical boy-girl hostility, they grow to become friends.  The second
quarter covers the pair's (now played by Lathan and Epps) senior year in
high school, when they become a couple.  The third quarter traces their
turbulent freshman year at USC, when their shared passions end up
conflicting with each other, setting the stage for the 1993-set fourth
quarter, which catches up with the two after college.</P>
<P>The scope of the film is ambitious--it also touches on their
less-than-smooth relationships with their parents, not to mention the
rocky relationship between Quincy's mom (Debbi Morgan) and dad--but
Prince-Bythewood keeps the focus simple.  All told, _Love_&_Basketball_
is nothing more than the story of two people who love each other--and I
mean people, not just characters.  Monica and Quincy are
multi-dimensional people, with their own individual strengths,
weaknesses, and dreams.  In an average movie, the script would have to
manufacture complications to pull them apart, but the problems the two
face are firmly rooted in who they are..  It could be said that the
biggest obstacle in their relationship is the one big obstacle faced by
couples in real life: each other's fundamental imperfection as human
beings.</P>
<P>Adding immeasurably to the authenticity of the film--both the sports
story and the romance--are Epps and especially Lathan.  Epps again proves
to be a consistently solid performer; he's charismatic, likable, and more
than up to the role's athletic requirements.  The revelation here is
Lathan, whose most high-profile role to date had been as Taye Diggs' love
interest in _The_Best_Man_.   Lathan is extremely convincing during
Monica's many hoops scenes--an accomplishment made more impressive by the
fact she could not ball worth a damn when she was initially cast.  Her
most glorious accomplishment, however, is her heartfelt dramatic
performance.  Monica carries the greatest emotional weight in the film,
and Lathan brings the role natural depth and nuance.  Even when the
formula mechanics of the film start to show, Lathan lends the proceedings
a crucial air of reality; she obviously believes in the material, and the
audience finds no difficulty in following suit.  A particularly
overwrought line has Monica telling Quincy she'll play a one-on-one game
for his heart, but Lathan makes it sound like the most natural thing
anyone can say at that moment.</P>
<P>_Love_&_Basketball_ isn't the most exciting of titles, but it's as
honest a title as one is likely to find gracing a multiplex marquee.  The
film indeed has a lot of love, a lot of basketball, and it delivers all
the expected payoffs at all the expected moments.  While that fact may
turn off people looking for something beyond the formula, I'd wager that
for most audiences, all that _Love_&_Basketball_ has to offer will more
than satisfy.</P>
