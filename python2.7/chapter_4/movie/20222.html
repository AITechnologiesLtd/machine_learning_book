ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Whether the world today is in a good or bad shape is a
matter of debate. However, many would agree that the world
looks much better than in the visions of film-makers from
late 1970s and early 1980s. The movies that marked the
Golden Age of Science Fiction cinema - MAD MAX, BLADE
RUNNER, ALIEN - painted the near future (and some of the
periods in which we live now) in very dark colours. Among
some of the directors who had joined the trend was John
Carpenter, young but already respectable director, who had
established his reputation with very cheap, but effective
genre films like DARK STAR, ASSAULT ON PRECINT 13 and
HALLOWEEN, who later became cult classics. His futuristic
action thriller ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, with some 7 millions
US$ in budget, was his first trip into the big budget
territory. Although some of the contemporary critics saw
film as a sell-out, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK became cult classic
too. Even the dreadful sequel ESCAPE FROM L.A. failed to
ruin the reputation of the original. It is somewhat ironic
that ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK marked the critical milestone of
Carpenter's career - after this film, the filmmaker went
mainstream, and his career, same as the world in this movie,
went south.</P>
<P>Among all the post-apocalyptic and dark futuristic films,
that thrived in that era of pessimism, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK
has the most outrageous plot premise. In 1988, the crime in
USA has quadrupled and the government, unable to preserve
law and order by any other means, decided to turn Manhattan
into maximum security prison. The prisoners forced to spend
the rest of their lives behind high walls, surrounded by
machineguns, minefields and thousands of policemen and
soldiers with shoot to kill orders. Into this living hell
falls plane carrying U.S. President (played by Donald
Pleasance), who is immediately taken hostage by the inmates.
Prison warden Hawk (Lee Van Cleefe) decides to rescue
President using the talents of "Snake" Plissken (Kurt
Russell), convicted bank robber and former World War 3
veteran. In exchange for his freedom, Plissken must enter
the prison and rescue the President in less than 24 hours.
His dedication to the job is enhanced with surgically
implanted mini-bombs within his arteries.</P>
<P>For the viewers who see this film for the first time, ESCAPE
FROM NEW YORK might look somewhat silly, considering the
fact that the bleak future, depicted in it, never happened.
It is inconceivable that the US government would try to
solve the crime problem by destroying the nation's top
economic and cultural centre. However, those viewers who
manage to suspend disbelief (among other things, we are to
believe that WW3 wouldn't go nuclear and that the wartime
America would still have efficient leftist underground),
should be rewarded with more than fine piece of cinema.
First of all, unlike many of the films inspired by it (Enzo
G. Castellari's rip-offs), this film has a unique
atmosphere, provided by cheap yet inventive and very
effective production design and special effects. The
Manhattan skyline, seen in total darkness, although matte,
has a very menacing look. The music, again composed by
multitalented Carpenter, is monotonous yet still effective -
sometimes being illustration of the action scenes, but most
of the time serving as some kind of ironic commentary
towards the whole movie.</P>
<P>However, the best icon of this film is the protagonist.
"Snake" Plissken, brilliantly portrayed by former Disney
child actor Kurt Russell, is one of the finest examples of
anti-heroes in modern cinema. With the anti- establishment
look of 1960s rebels, combined with the world-weary voice
that brings memories of Clint Eastwood in his spaghetti
western phase, Kurt Russell created one of the most
effective action protagonists in decades to come. His
character is superbly portrayed with only few lines. Of
course, Russell isn't alone - he shares film with a lot of
great character actors in small but memorable roles. Lee Van
Cleef, playing the warden, with his presence connects this
film with Sergio Leone's classics. Ernest Borgnine is also
very effective in a role of the last remaining New York
cabby, while always reliable Harry Dean Stanton shines in
the role of Brain. Isaac Hayes is great as the charismatic
chief villain, Duke of New York.</P>
<P>Compared with some of the more recent products of action
genre, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK looks somewhat slow. There are
relatively few action scenes, and they don't last long. Some
of the critics tend to see this as a movie's flaw, because
the long pauses aren't used by Carpenter to show more of
apocalyptic New York and its prison society. Others point
out that the most of the movie takes place at night, which
could be explained with Carpenter's budgetary restrictions.
However, despite those flaws, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK is still
a very good movie. Failed as futuristic vision, it is still
a superb action adventure, movie that makes us nostalgic
towards the times when the future looked bleak.</P>
