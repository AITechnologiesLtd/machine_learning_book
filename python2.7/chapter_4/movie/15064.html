<PRE>The Winner (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>** out of *****</PRE>
<P>Cast: Rebecca DeMornay, Vincent D'Onofrio, Delroy Lindo, Frank Whaley,
Michael Madsen, Billy Bob Thornton
Written by: Wendy Riss (based on her stage play)
Directed by: Alex Cox
Running Time: 92 minutes</P>
<P>When I see something has been based on a stage play, that's usually a
sign that the movie I'm about to watch will be horribly bad.  Stage
plays very rarely (if ever) translate well to the film screen.  Then I
thought that maybe the top-notch cast in The Winner would make the
film an exception.  I was wrong.</P>
<P>In The Winner, Vincent D'Onofrio plays a seemingly dimwitted gambler
who all of a sudden starts to win every time he plays on Sundays.
Soon, all sorts of low-lifes are trying to swindle him out of his
money.  Sound good?  Well it sure should have been.</P>
<P>The film had some potential, but it was wrecked by the staging of each
and every scene.  Each scene feels like a scene in a play and not one
in a movie.  They feel as though they are all being improvised,
something which may fit right into a play, but just is uncomfortable
to watch on film.  Especially since these are exactly stage actors out
there on the screen (don't get me wrong, it's a great cast... but some
actors just can't do both stage and screen).  And even though it seems
that I've written this many many times lately, but Frank Whaley is
again woefully miscast, this time as a cheap thug.  Is anyone advising
him on his choice of roles?</P>
<P>I guess if I was one of those silly critics like Joel Siegel I'd end
this review with something retarded like "The Winner is a loser".
Wouldn't that be cute?  Well, it might be true, but I'm just not going
to do it.  [R]</P>
