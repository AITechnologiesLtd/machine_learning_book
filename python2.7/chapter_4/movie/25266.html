                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Well, comic book freaks can take a breather, as another sci-fi
fantasy hits the big screen, this time in the long-awaited,
highly-anticipated, it-better-be-good X-Men.</P>
<P>     Without too much regret, I can say that X-Men will be palatable to
fans and newbies alike.  It's not a great film, but it will probably
follow the arc of the Superman and Batman movies -- tons of sequels of
variable quality until an abrupt and dismal end a decade later.</P>
<P>     The film is largely focused on introducing the very idea of the
has mutated to the point where various members of it find themselves
endowed with superhuman abilities: telepathy, walking on water/through
walls, regeneration, and the like are commonplace.  As with most modes
of difference, the mutants find themselves vilified by the public, and a
Senator (Bruce Davison) launches a crusade to mandate "mutant
registration."</P>
<P>     How the group of X-Men came to be is unclear, but we do know that
Dr. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is their leader and that he's wealthy
beyond belief, funding an apparently tuition-free school for mutant kids
where they can harness their powers in peace.  Dr. X (X-Men, get it?)
recruits adults, too, with monikers like the laser-eyed Cyclops (James
Marsden), the weather-controlling Storm (Halle Berry), and the
telekinetic Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) -- the only X-Person who
doesn't have a nickname.  Together, the X-Men peacefully oppose the
government's anti-mutant tide, while battling the "evil" Magneto (Ian
McKellan), a concentration camp survivor that can control metal with his
mind.</P>
<P>     Soon the film begins to turn around newcomers to the X-Men -- the
super-tough Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and the power-stealing Rogue (Anna
Paquin) -- and a Magneto plot to capture them consumes the rest of the
movie.  Ultimately it is revealed that Magneto's plan is to give all the
human leaders of the world a mutation of their own, through a
contraption he's built that will be unveiled at a conveniently-timed
"World Summit" on Ellis Island.  Whew!</P>
<P>     Strangely enough, X-Men is not as complicated as it sounds.  In
fact, its major flaw is that it spends the bulk of an hour simply
explaining what mutations are, who the good guys and bad guys are, and
what their respective powers are.  Everyone has two names -- a real one
and a nickname like "Sabretooth" -- and at least one has the power to
shift shape (an unrecognizable Rebecca Romijn-Stamos with no lines in
her own voice).  The exposition is necessary to have the movie make
sense, but it weighs the film down with a tedium that takes you
completely out of the action.</P>
<P>     That aside, X-Men's biggest flaw is that all mutants appear to be
stupid beyond belief.  Xavier and Magneto are presented to us as genius
arch-rivals, but the plots Magneto cooks up to capture the enemy are
straight out of an old "Batman" TV show episode.  Why go to all the
trouble to trick one mutant and poison another when you can just send
your shapeshifter in to do the dirty work?  Why can't Dr. X figure out
why Magneto is interested in Wolverine?  I suppose questioning the logic
of a movie called X-Men makes me sound a bit nutty, but there it is.</P>
<P>     While fans will appreciate the largely accurate portrayal of the
team (with the notable exception of Rogue being played as a barely
pubescent teenager), inside jokes like cracks about Wolverine's yellow
Spandex will be lost on most of the audience.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, X-Men is a reasonably entertaining movie, but it's one
that started to bother me the moment I left the theater.  Here's why: 
The X-Men want to stop a potential war between humans and mutants, and
Dr. X thinks Magneto is brewing this war up.  But Magneto isn't doing
anything of the sort.  He's cooked up this machine that will give
mutations to humans -- and therefore a better understanding of mutants,
and ergo, no war.  Magneto has a great idea!  If his machine worked
right, everything would have been peachy.  The fact that it doesn't
feels inserted by one of the half-dozen uncredited screenwriters just to
make the movie a little less nonsensical.</P>
<P>     Anyway, I predict the legacy of X-Men to be this:  1) There will
undoubtedly be a sequel.  2) It will be a whole lot better than the
original.  Vive la difference.</P>
