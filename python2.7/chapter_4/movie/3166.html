<PRE>                                    I.Q.
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     When I first read a small synopsis of the film, I thought it was
going to be a real dog: "Einstein acts as a cupid for a pair of young
lovers."  I was therefore prepared for the worst.  As it turned out, it
was not nearly as bad as I had anticipated.</P>
<P>     Einstein (Walter Matthau, looking exactly like old Albert
himself), has a niece, Catherine (Meg Ryan), a very bright
mathematician.  She is having her car fixed at a place where Ed (Tim
Robbins) works.  With her is her fiance, James, (Peter Fry who was
Peter in the film PETER'S FRIENDS ... and Jeeves on the PBS series).</P>
<P>     It only takes one glance at Catherine for Ed to fall madly in
love.  Ed, although a mere auto mechanic, is interested in aspects of
science and he uses "Time" to envision him being married to her and
their having 2 children.   Meg, of course, is unaware of Ed's fantasy.</P>
<P>     Einstein when he learns of Ed's infatuation with his niece thinks
it is a great idea, far superior to her marrying the dull Peter even if
he is a scholarly psychiatrist.  Albert and his science cronies set
about getting Catherine to drop Peter and to fall in love with Ed.</P>
<P>     While there are many scientific and mathematical jokes as well as
a dozen gags about "time does not exist," they are all in the first
half of the film.   The second half is devoted to how the writers would
get around to having the mathematician settle for the auto mechanic who
thinks he, too, is a scientist.  Unfortunately, the writers did not
succeed.</P>
<P>     Another segment that hurt the movie was the scene where Einstein
and his fellow geniuses are trying to help Ed in a test he is taking by
grimacing at him to give him the answers--an utterly childish bit of
buffoonery.</P>
<P>     In the cast are also Charles Durning, James Maher, Gene Saks, and
Lou Jacobi.</P>
