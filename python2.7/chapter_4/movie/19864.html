<P>         "The Thomas Crown Affair" (1968) was one of those
self-consciously "mod" caper films Hollywood cranked out by the dozens
in the late 1960s, this one starring Steve McQueen as Thomas Crown, a
millionaire who masterminded robberies simply for the thrill of it and
Faye Dunaway as a chic insurance investigator who falls under his spell
while trying to bust him. In its day, the movie's multi-screen imagery
and anti-Establishment theme ("it's me against the system," Crown says
as a rationale for his behavior) struck a chord with young moviegoers,
but it's remembered today, if at all, only for its Oscar-winning theme
song "The Windmills of Your Mind" and for a suggestive chess match
played out by McQueen and Dunaway, a scene mercilessly parodied in
"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me."</P>
<P> The chess game has been left out of the new "Thomas Crown
Affair," but that doesn't mean stars Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo don't
find plenty of opportunities to fool around. This "Crown," a smarter and
more exciting film than the original, is essentially a two-hour excuse
to get this beautiful couple into one compromising position after
another, usually with some sort of glamorous party or exotic beach
serving as a background. Those viewers who've felt a bit cheated by such
recent squeaky-clean romances as "Runaway Bride" may be intrigued to
hear "Crown" also features some of the most physically challenging
trysts in years. Its R-rating is well-deserved.</P>
<P> "Crown" also represents a big step forward for Brosnan, whose
non-James Bond screen appearances ("The Mirror Has Two Faces," "The
Lawnmower Man," etc.) have not
exactly established him as a genuine movie star. Here, he demonstrates
his light comic touch and more than holds his own against the
smouldering Russo. They're a pair to reckon with.</P>
<P> The screenplay by Leslie Dixon and Kurt Wimmer changes the bank
robbery of the first film into an art heist, a crime that better suits
the ever-suave Crown (Brosnan). Investigator Catherine Banning (Russo)
deduces the enigmatic billionaire must have something to do with the
theft -- after all, he once wrecked a $100,000 sailboat just because "he
liked the splash" -- and she follows his trail straight into his arms,
where she learns they have a good deal in common.</P>
<P> They're both from modest backgrounds, they both enjoy the good
life and both have trouble maintaining long-term relationships. Over
dinner one night she asks him, "is it more fun getting it than keeping
it?" and it's not hard to tell she's asking about more than just the
stolen painting.
 "Crown" shrewdly plays on the time-honored working woman's fantasy of
having it all, as Catherine ends up jetting off to Martinique and having
a passionate fling while still getting her job done. Of course in a
situation like this reality must sooner or later enter the picture, and
when it does our heroine must decide whether she's going to bed her man
or bust him.</P>
<P> Given that director John McTiernan's resume includes such
now-classic thrillers as "Die Hard" and "The Hunt For Red October," it's
a given the picture's action sequences are smoothly executed. But
McTiernan also knows how to downshift for the quieter scenes, and he
even gets a surprisingly sincere performance out of Denis Leary, who
plays Catherine's somewhat sympathetic partner in crime-fighting.</P>
<P> "This is an elegant crime done by an elegant person," Catherine
declares at one point. That verdict applies to the movie as well. James
