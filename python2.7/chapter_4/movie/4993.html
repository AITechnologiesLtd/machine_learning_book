<PRE>** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        I guess I should point off first of all that I didn't actually pay 
to see this movie. I had nothing to do and it was on the dorm's cable 
network so I decided to give it a whirl, with the full knowledge that 
this would be the most mediocre Disney cartoon since about 1946. In 
the tradition of all the history-bending Disney tales, POCAHONTAS 
takes pains to present the most politically-correct portrayal of Native 
Americans (can't even call 'em Indians anymore!) despite having a 
heroine that looks like Cindy Crawford and ignoring nearly all 
historical facts. For starters, the real Pocahontas was around twelve 
when she met John Smith but I don't see any "Pedophelia" song and 
dance number.</P>
<P>        As the story opens, Pocahontas is out singing to the animals 
and talking to the old woman tree spirit when the drunken, corrupt 
Englishmen arrive in the new world, led by the round Governor 
Ratcliffe (as for the way his character looks and talks, remember the 
Sheriff of Nottingham from ROBIN HOOD?) and John Smith. Here 
we get more factual White-Out applied to history. Smith didn't come 
over until the third Jamestown excursion, after all the original 
colonists were dying of dysentery (again, a song-and-dance number 
they left out), and he sure didn't look like Mel Gibson. Imagine the 
pairing of John Goodman and Christina Ricci and there's your real-life 
romance.</P>
<P>        We instantly are forced to side with the Ind... er, Native 
Americans upon seeing the rudeness of the settlers, who immediately 
dig up all the earth in search of gold. The natives don't take well to 
this intrusion, attacking once or twice. Ratcliffe asks what possible 
motive the "savages" would have for attacking God's people, to his 
effeminate servant's response, "Let's see, we stole their land, cut down 
their trees and dug up their earth."</P>
<P>        Alright, dammit! All us white guys know it was wrong to 
steal the land away from the Indians and force them into an existence 
of selling Navajo blankets on the side of the road, but I refuse to feel 
guilty about it. And if the Disney people want to make us all feel guilt 
about it, I don't think the proper medium is a cheery movie where the 
trees talk and everyone breaks into song at the drop of a tribal 
headdress. Maybe another black-and-white three hour epic detailing 
every minute of the inhumanity and suffering, but not a G-rated movie 
where a raccoon and a dog playfully fight over food in every other 
scene.</P>
<P>        So Pocahontas investigates the new visitors and meets Smith, 
who turns out to be a Not-Bad White Guy (the only one in the movie). 
After the customary song about how narrow-minded and self-centered 
the whiteys are for not realizing the trees do actually talk, the two end 
up falling in love. It's a match made in the pit of hell. The Indians are 
mad at her for befriending the enemy, not to mention the fact that 
she's already engaged to one of her own people ("But he's so... 
serious," Pocahontas claims in her 17th century valley girl voice. 
Welcome to Jamestown, 90210.), and Smith's friends are also upset 
he's wasting his superior Anglo self on the savage girl, even if she 
does look like this month's centerfold.</P>
<P>        I really don't know what to say about this one. PC-HONTAS 
annoyed me most of the time with its constant sensitivity issues and 
screwing around with history. Nowhere is that more evident than the 
happy ending, where the colonists realize the Indians are human after 
all and befriend them. Um, when did that one happen? Was it 
somewhere along that whole Trail of Tears thing when the Americans 
massacred 30,000 of them? Besides that, it's probably the least 
entertaining Disney animated feature in a long time. The songs are 
substandard and there are way too many of them. If you can overlook 
that and can control the vomit reflex every time we get a speech about 
ethnic intolerance and the stealing of land, maybe you'll be entertained 
by it. I wasn't.</P>
