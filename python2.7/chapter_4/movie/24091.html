<P>Love and Basketball is a mawkish, overly-poignant and clichéd movie that
mindlessly bounces along without ever making a clear statement. For the
majority of the two-hour running time, the latter half of the title watches
from the bench as the picture makes a faulty bounce-pass at romance and
family values in the court of life. At the end, the viewing experience is no
more pleasurable and just as frustrating as rooting for the
destined-to-be-annihilated-opponent at a Harlem Globetrotters game.</P>
<P>As the `first quarter' (the movie voluntarily divides itself into four
quarters that are as even in length as Muggsy Bogues and Gheorghe Muresan
are in height) begins, we meet Monica Wright (Sanaa Lathan), the new girl on
the block who is as much a tomboy as her older sister is a beauty queen. She
aspires to be the first woman in the NBA and will, ultimately, have a career
in basketball. But first she needs to overcome the preconceived notion,
which her mother happily lives, of a woman belonging in a kitchen – not on
the basketball court.</P>
<P>Before long, Monica is accepted in the neighborhood and befriends her next
door neighbor, Quincy McCall (Omar Epps), who also aspires to NBA greatness.
But for Quincy, the road is much more inviting with the aid of a father who
is already playing in the league that so many youth dream of joining. As the
two grow up together, their romance fades in and out with their destiny of
belonging with each other being painfully obvious to everyone but the two
aspiring athletes. Such relationships have grown tired on screen thanks to
other abysmal films like Drive Me Crazy and Whatever it Takes and this duo
do little to wake up the device.</P>
<P>As the quarters go on, the two children's personalities change possession.
Monica ceases to be the over-aggressive, tempestuous tomboy that she was and
finds a happy medium in life while Quincy turns away from the romantic,
understanding traits he had grown up with and allows his ego to take over.
There is little surprise when such turns take place as it can be expected
that any athlete who turns pro in the movies (Quincy enters the draft after
just one year of College) will develop such self-importance and any person
who struggles to find acceptance (Monica doesn't break the gender barrier in
the NBA), becomes humbled and wise overnight.</P>
<P>As the two become young adults, they round out their clichéd lives with
family conflicts. Monica struggles with her mother who prefers to see her in
a dress and pearls than a jersey and headband while Quincy is forced to deal
with his father's unbiblical behavior with a female fan. These excess
subplots do little to move the film through its two hours and could be as
easily disposed of as Michael Jordan's baseball career.</P>
<P>The one place where the film does score points, sometimes at least, is in
the game of morals. Writer/director Gina Prince does her predominately
teenage audience a favor in showing the young couple use a condom when they
first engage in intercourse. There is also a minor emphasis put on the
importance of education although it may well be too little to late to have a
real impact. Still, better some positive traits then none.</P>
<P>As you have probably gathered, the game of basketball takes a back seat to
the game of life in Love and Basketball. Although I applaud the film for not
feeling the need to use a dramatic last-minute buzzer-beater, something that
too many films these days overuse, I find it ironic that this movie might
well be one of the few that could benefit from such action.</P>
