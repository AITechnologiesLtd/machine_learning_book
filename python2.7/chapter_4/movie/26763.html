<PRE>"The Legend of Bagger Vance"</PRE>
<P>Runnulph Junuh (Matt Damon) had it all. He was a golf prodigy with a
promising future and a beautiful, wealthy young wife, Adele (Charlize
Theron), whom he loved madly. Then, the world was plunged into the Great
War and Runnulph went overseas to do his patriotic duty. The horrors of WWI
and the gruesome loss of his entire command drove Junuh to disappear from
all he knew and the life he loved in Savannah. He reappears unexpectedly
over a decade later to find that Adele is facing bankruptcy. She arranges
"the greatest golf exhibition on the best course" and Junuh is reluctantly
recruited as Savannah's favorite son in "The Legend of Bagger Vance."</P>
<P>Director Robert Redford, from the very start with his Oscar winning
"Ordinary People" through "A River Runs Through It" and "The Horse
Whisperer," has given his films a uniquely atmospheric feel that is his
signature. He continues to show his individual auteur with "The Legend of
Bagger Vance," this time taking on the fantasy story about a fairy
godfather who arrives on the scene at just the time when our hero needs
help the most. It's a trite, near overdone tale that benefits from the
strong performances of the leads, solid supporting cast and high-grade
techs. Redford isn't a shabby director, either.</P>
<P>While Bagger Vance (Will Smith) is an obvious Zen master, he, fortunately,
isn't forced to recite such homilies as "be one with the ball," but
screenwriter Jeremy Leven comes close. "It's you, that ball and that flag,"
says Bagger to the troubled Runnulph after the mysterious man appears out
of nowhere and offers to caddy for Junuh for "five dollars guaranteed." It
does get a bit cliched as Bagger gives his homey advice and observations,
like: "You lost your swing. We gotta find it," and "Let it [the shot]
choose you." Smith's wry demeanor and likable presence helps the filmmakers
get away with such obvious Yoda-isms.</P>
<P>While Smith revels in his down home rendition of Junuh's mentor and trainer
- he's a mix of the aforementioned Yoda, Mickey for "Rocky" and a little
bit of "E.T." - Matt Damon gives the most complex arc to his performance as
the insecure, troubled Runnulph. It's a subtle perf by Damon that
effectively uses facial expression to build his character, showing both
angst and determination.</P>
<P>When young Hardy Greaves (J. Michael Montcrief) spots Junuh returning to
Savannah after many years, he immediately starts campaigning to get the
former golf genius as the local contender in Adele's $10,000 purse
tournament. Against his will, Junuh agrees to play and picks up his sticks
to learn the game again (and, maybe, rekindle something with Adele). Out of
the darkness comes Bagger Vance who immediately starts to rag on Junuh
good-naturedly, helps him find his game again and gets an agreement to be
caddy for the big match.</P>
<P>Once the fairy tale is established, the film gets down to the game.
Runnulph is playing two of the best in the business - Bobby Jones (Joel
Gretsch) and Walter Hagan (Bruce McGill) - and they are more than a match
for the insecure Junuh. He immediately falls behind and it looks like the
citizens of Savannah are about to have their hopes of a victorious local
dashed. Bagger doesn't perform any magic except to open Junuh's eyes with
the help of Hardy, who absolutely idolizes Runnulph. The golf play is
nicely done as the game becomes a metaphor for life. Junuh finds his
original swing.</P>
<P>The story shows its literary roots (the novel is by Steven Pressfield) with
plot threads that are separate from the main yarn. There is a nice little
subplot involving Hardy and his dad. Because of the catastrophe of the
Depression, Hardy's father, Frank Greaves (Trip Hamilton), is forced to
take a job as streetsweeper in Savannah. This is a point of humiliation for
the boy who is ashamed of the lowly job his father takes. Junuh helps Hardy
learn the truth about his father, a truth that turns the boy's eyes from
admonishing to admiring, making the small side story a nicely sentimental
one.</P>
<P>Backing up Damon and Smith are several good performances, especially an
endearing one by young Montcrief. The debut perf is an assured and varied
one as Hardy exhibits expressions of wonder, shame, happiness and sadness.
Joel Gretsch and Bruce McGill flesh out their characters of Jones and
Hagan. Bobby Jones is elegance in motion and Gretsch captures this
gracefulness perfectly, while Walter Hagan represents raw power and
endurance, also captured well by McGill. Both men display the honor of fair
play and giving the game their best. The two actors get past the symbolism
of their characters and make them real people. Charlize Theron is only OK
as Adele, but hers is the toughest kind of role - the neglected/abandoned
wife.</P>
<P>Tech credits, as you would expect in a Robert Redford film, are of the
highest caliber. Michael Ballhaus, who collaborated with Redford on "Quiz
Show," gives the film an atmospheric look that captures the sultry warmth
of Savannah. The lush photography is coupled with an outstanding period
production design by Academy Award winner Stuart Craig and stunning
costume, especially for Theron, by Judianna Makovsky. Musical score, by
Rachel Portman, and songs of the time help to carry forth the period feel.</P>
<P>The fairy tale nature of "The Legend of Bagger Vance'" (though the "legend"
is never discussed) has been done many times before, but the good natured
outlook and mysticism of Bagger makes this an entertaining film that has no
golf prerequisite. I give it a B.</P>
