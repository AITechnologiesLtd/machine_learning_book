<PRE>20 Dates    * * * (out of * * * * )</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Myles Berkowitz.
1999 - 86 minutes.
Rated R (for profanity).
Reviewed August 23, 1999.</PRE>
<P>"20 Dates" is an often funny, always engaging romantic comedy filmed in a 
documentary format concerning the plight of first-time director Myles 
Berkowitz to find that special someone by going on twenty dates with twenty 
different women. Berkowitz proves to be a likable protagonist, and the 
unexpectedly close relationship that evolves between an aspiring interior 
designer named Elisabeth and he may be one of the most involving, 
warm-hearted romances on film in 1999. Sultry actress Tia Carrere ("Wayne's 
World") briefly appears as Berkowitz's final "date."</P>
