<P>You know the story.  Marion Crane (Anne Heche, in this case) takes
$400,000 from her boss, skips town, and heads into the desert.  There,
she comes across the old Bates Motel, owned and run by Mr. Norman Bates
(Vince Vaughn).  If this story doesn't sound familiar to you, or if you
don't know what happens to Marion Crane at the Bates Motel, I suggest
you go out and rent a film called Psycho.  It was directed by Alfred
Hitchcock, and came out in 1960.  </P>
<P>Or, if you don't like black and white, you could go to the theater and
see Gus Van Sant's Psycho.  When my screening of Van Sant's version
ended, just a few hours ago, I felt that the most appropriate review
would be to write the word "Why?" five-thousand times.  Since then, I've
managed to isolate my befuddlement into coherence.  Hitchcock's Psycho
isn't a perfect film, but it's a good one, and has some genuine scares
and a few interesting characters.  It's only been thirty-eight years
since it came out; it's really not that dated, and is still effective by
many of today's slasher standards.  So why remake it?</P>
<P>I was hoping to get my answer.  I was looking forward to Van Sant's
take on the classic horror tale, mostly to understand why he felt the
need to do it.  But I didn't get my answer.  Van Sant's film is
basically a colorized mirror image of the original.  The dialogue is the
same.  The characters are the same.  The sets and locations are all the
same.  Every single camera angle is exactly the same.  With the
exception of one scene of implied masturbation, and perhaps a little
more blood, Gus Van Sant's Psycho is an exact recreation of Hitchcock's
original film.</P>
<P>So why on God's green earth was there a reason to make this film
*again*?  Well, I read that Van Sant was "paying homage" to Hitchcock. 
I can see it from that perspective.  The new film doesn't reek of
plagiarism as much as it screams, "I'm such a devoted fan!"  Van Sant is
a wonderful director (Good Will Hunting, To Die For, and My Own Private
Idaho are all exceptional films in different ways), and so I took this
remake seriously.  Why would a great director feel the need to remake a
film of another great director?  In addition, the original Psycho had
the element of shock -- in this new version, that aspect is lost
entirely.  As I said, if you don't know what happens to Marion in the
shower, you need to see the original first.</P>
<P>Before you flip out, understand that I don't mean Van Sant should have
tried to improve on Hitchcock's direction.  No, that would have been
silly.  The fact that Van Sant didn't experiment with different
techniques is a good thing.  But this story should have been updated;
the characters don't speak like people from the 90s -- particularly
Norman Bates.  The private investigator (played by a wonderful William
H. Macy) is a fun character, but do private investigators still act like
that?  Something tells me they don't.  There aren't any blatant
anachronisms, but the script hasn't been changed at all.</P>
<P>If anything, seeing this new version reminded me of what was wrong with
the original.  After Marion Crane dies, the focus shifts to two
uninteresting characters -- Marion's boyfriend, Sam (Viggo Mortensen)
and sister, Lila (Julianne Moore).  As they're trying to figure out what
happened to Marion, we're left wondering why they don't just tackle
Norman Bates and search through that big old house on the hill.  Perhaps
when the original came out it was shocking to see the main character die
half way through.  Moore and Mortensen are both adequate for their
roles, but the script just doesn't have much for them to do.</P>
<P>The film isn't bad or unpleasant; Heche and Vaughn both hit their roles
dead-on, and any scene featuring one or both of them is inescapably
entertaining.  In addition, the scenes that everybody will be watching
for -- particularly the dreaded Shower Scene -- have been done with
class; Van Sant, in a wise move, didn't exploit the violence or go
over-the-top with gore.  It's only slightly more graphic than the
original (though the sound effects are a lot harsher in this one).</P>
<P>Just about the only improvement is on the sound quality of the music
(the music, by the way, is excellent).  But I know the point was not to
improve on the original, but "to bring it to a new generation."  I'm not
sure why the New Generation can't go out and rent the original, but it
seems they're going to be disappointed with Psycho anyway.  The New
Generation wants movies like I Still Know What You Did Last Summer;
Psycho -- new or old -- just isn't gory enough for them.  </P>
<P>As for me, I wanted a better reason to sit through a replica of the
original.  Van Sant is a great director, but the one thing about
Hitchcock's Psycho was that it was really shocking.  The only way this
new version could have been shocking would have been to change it.  And,
of course it shouldn't have been changed, and so we enter a vicious
circle that didn't need to be entered in the first place.</P>
