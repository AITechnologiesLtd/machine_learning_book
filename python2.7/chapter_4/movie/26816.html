<PRE>Best In Show </PRE>
<P>"Mockumentaries" are an under-appreciated genre of film. I'd imagine making 
one would be more difficult than making a regular comedy because you have to 
convey an atmosphere of reality while being satirical and sometimes all-out 
hysterical. That said I'd like to go on record as saying "Best In Show" will 
be the most over-looked film this year. It's one of the smartest comedies 
I've seen in years. </P>
<P>Last year a mockumentary called "Drop Dead Gorgeous" did a good job in 
zinging the beauty pageant industry. That film had some pretty big names to 
it but didn't do as well as expected at the box office.  That film took a 
biting look at how serious some people get over such a relatively superficial 
event. With "Best In Show," co-writer and director Christopher Guest realizes 
human vanity is an easy target to parody and he succeeds by taking human 
vanity a step further to the point where vanity becomes a lifestyle. No, it's 
not about rich snobs (although the film does spoof them too), it's about 
people who are active participants in the dog show circuit. To them their pet 
is not really a companion but a ticket to fame and fortune and the lengths 
they'll go through for that is unbelievably funny. </P>
<P>The film is an ensemble of about 20 main characters who are all realistic 
people but have their own quirkiness. I hesitate to list the "stars" since 
most of the characters are given equal screen time and contribute to the 
comedy in their own way. </P>
<P>We start by meeting many different people from around the country who are 
about to travel to Philadelphia for the supposedly world-renowned Mayflower 
Dog Show. They all have different breeds of dogs and treat them in a 
different way. Some practically worship their canine, others order them 
around like a parent would to a small child. Some pamper their pooches like 
babies and some treat them like equals. What they all have in common is a 
desire to win the Best In Show award because they have truly dedicated a 
piece of themselves to their dogs and would like to think it's something more 
then just an owner-master relationship. </P>
<P>Of course the humans' personalities play an integral role in making the film 
the delight it is. To really do the movie justice I should go over ALL of 
them individually, but instead I'll just give a few good examples. </P>
<P>Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara play a Florida couple who seem to be 
experienced in the dog show industry. Levy's character Gerry is a dorky wuss 
married to a buxom blonde named Cookie who, shall we say, "has a reputation." 
Levy is excellent in this role because you don't know if he's clueless or too 
shrewd to do anything every time his wife meets another man who seems to know 
her from somewhere. There's one particular scene where the two stop at a 
couple's house and the husband (played perfectly by Larry Miller) is all over 
Cookie in front of both his wife and Gerry. </P>
<P>Another strange couple is Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey and Michael 
Hitchcock) who are so obsessed with their dog and perfection from it they 
actually visit a pet psychologist and discuss how their sex life effects 
their dog and their chances of winning at the show. Posey has some 
outstanding scenes where she flies off the handle when the slightest problem 
crops up.  What she does to anyone who gets in her is what exemplifies smart 
black comedy. </P>
<P>Two other couples to mention are a stereotypical gay couple who are genuinely 
funny and not offensive, and a gold-digging bimbo and her ambiguous female 
friend who handles her award-winning poodle. There's also a southern man 
whose best friend is a purebred bloodhood. </P>
<P>In writing these character descriptions just now I noticed I either used or 
wanted to used a term to describe how excellent the performances were. I have 
never seen such commitment to character in a comedy before. Since this is a 
mockumentary I would imagine many of the lines were ad-libed because they 
never come across as forced or cliche. If you listen closely you'll hear some 
fantastic lines and quick comments that add to the detail of the characters 
and their situations. They're like inside jokes that don't need any 
explanation. </P>
<P>And that all comes back to the direction and production of the film. Guest's 
camera work keeps the atmosphere realistic with characters talking over other 
characters and constant activity in the background (again, listen for those 
subtle one-liners). There's a few scenes of people talking directly to the 
camera to voice their thoughts on things but Guest doesn't rely on this 
technique to fill in characteristics or plot points. In fact I'd criticize 
him for not using ENOUGH of these sequences. </P>
<P>Special mention MUST be made to the contribution of Fred Willard as a TV 
commentator covering the dog show as if it were a major sporting event. 
Willard is the king of Hollywood's working actors in my mind. His presence 
alone automatically makes any scene or sketch funny because he's so deadpan 
in his approach. He comes up with comments that are usually silly but catch 
you off guard and you can't help but laugh. Here he's teamed with an Engl
ishman playing the role of the expert on dog shows who has terrific comic 
timing and chemistry with Willard. </P>
<P>What makes "Best In Show" great is how smoothly it flows between the 
performances, the screenplay and the direction. Most comedies have funny 
jokes and average performances, but how many comedies can you name where the 
direction was one of the reasons it worked as well as it did? </P>
<PRE>GRADE: B+ </PRE>
