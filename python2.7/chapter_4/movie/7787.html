<P>     Really, is anyone going to be surprised to learn that I walked out
on BUDDY, director Caroline Thompson's family-friendly drama, based on
the real life of Gertrude Lintz, an eccentric socialite in the 1920's
who loved animals, liked to keep chimps around the house, and raised a
certain gorilla as if it were a human child?  Despite a game cast (Rene
Russo, Robbie Coltrane, Irma P. Hall, and, in one scene, the Artist
Formerly Known as Pee Wee Herman), a workable premise, and a director
who most certainly knows her way around odd (she wrote EDWARD SCISSOR-
HANDS, among other things), there isn't a thing here to engage the
brain.  No subtext, no wit, no tension, no terror.  Nothing.  Nada.
Zip.</P>
<P>     So, if you can find amusement in watching well-dressed chimps mon-
key around a mansion... or delight in the care and feeding of anima-
tronic animal infants... or have never seen David Letterman pose the
question Can a Guy in a Gorilla Suit Get Into a Feature Film?, then 
this might be the movie for you.  Or, more likely, your kids.  Other-
wise, you'll probably end up as I did, feeling like a caged animal after
a mere twenty minutes.  My companion, however, had another half-hour of
optimism in her and, until that blessed beeline to the lobby, I passed
the time by imagining alternate fates for the furry tyke:  drop-kicked
by Bruce Willis, cryogenically frozen with Mike Myers, pitched head-
first into a lava flow, and, of course, swallowed whole by a still-
hungry Tyrannosaurus Rex.  Chomp.</P>
