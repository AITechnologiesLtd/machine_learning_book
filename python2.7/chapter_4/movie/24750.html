<P>Woody Allen, one of the most critically admired, but publically underrated, 
filmmakers working today, makes one film a year, and almost without fail, 
they are small, but memorable and well-acted, gems. Allen has a talent for 
dialogue and getting the best out of his performers (just look at Mira 
Sorvino's brilliant, Oscar-winning turn in 1995's "Mighty Aphrodite"), and in 
his comedies, is as quick and snappy in his wordplay as they come. </P>
<P>Allen's latest picture, "Small Time Crooks," is the type of sharp-witted and 
smart caper comedy that you would expect from him, similar to 1993's 
"Manhattan Murder Mystery" and 1971's "Bananas," with a hint of 1977's "Annie 
Hall" thrown in for bittersweet measure. There is always a joy that goes 
along with watching Allen's films, and a comfort, too, due to their often 
similar format, each one an obvious tribute from someone who is in love with 
the movies as much as I am.</P>
<P>Ray (Woody Allen) and Frenchy Winkler (Tracey Ullman) have been married for 
years, living day to day and paycheck to paycheck (he as a dishwasher, she as 
a manicurist) in their Manhattan apartment. An ex-crook who once did time for 
theft, Ray is always dreaming of the most elaborate or crazy schemes on how 
they can get more money, and while a sassy straight-shooter who tells it like 
it is, Frenchy finds herself consistently going along with his plans, no 
matter how risky, because she loves him. So when Ray tells French about his 
latest, and most dangerous, plan yet, in which they are going to buy out a 
closed-down pizza shop so they can shovel through the ground and rob the back 
next door, she quickly dismisses the idea, but soon goes along with it. 
Partnered with Tommy (Tony Darrow), former cellmate Benny (Jon Lovitz), and 
dimwitted Denny (Michael Rapaport), they plan to cut the money equally 
between them once they get to it. In the meantime, to distract the public, 
Frenchy acts as a cookie maker in the front of the shop, and unforseeably, 
her baking becomes the overnight sensation of the city.</P>
<P>Switch to a year later, Ray and Frenchy's bank heist plans have fallen 
through, and
instead, they have become millionaires overnight, the owners of the most 
successful
cookie franchise in the area, Sunset Cookies. But as their wealth 
dramatically rises, Frenchy yearns to become a sophisticated socialite, while 
Ray still prefers the simpler things in life. For the Winkler's, their 
relationship, and their goals in life, have become as distant as night and 
day.</P>
<P>The pleasure that comes from watching "Small Time Crooks" lies prominently in 
its reliably fresh screenplay. Although some may falsely accuse Woody Allen 
of making the same basic movie over and over, that is far from the truth, as 
each of his films may have the markings of himself as a filmmaker, but are 
almost consistently satisfying and creative, a refreshing retreat from 
today's increasingly boring big-budget Hollywood movies. Allen not only has a 
way with writing intelligent characters, but he gives his top-notch actors a 
chance to truly shine and prove their talent. Relatively underappreciated 
actors such as the aforementioned Sorvino, Jennifer Tilly and Chazz 
Palminteri (1994's "Bullets Over Broadway"), Kirstie Alley (1997's 
"Deconstructing Harry"), and Juliette Lewis (1992's "Husbands & Wives") have 
all been given the chance to do superb work in recent Allen endeavors.</P>
<P>In "Small Time Crooks," the champion performers are Tracey Ullman, as Ray's 
wife Frenchy, and Elaine May, as Frenchy's dim-bulb, sweet-natured cousin. 
Ullman (an Emmy-award winning actress for HBO's "Tracey Takes On...") conveys 
a genuine delight for acting here, and is equipped with the second central 
role, not to mention the flashiest, in the film. Her fast-tongued line 
deliveries to Allen are often hysterically funny and honest, and while 
Frenchy and Ray are involved in a rocky marriage, both she and Allen 
believably seem like two people who are in love with each other. </P>
<P>As with many of Allen's actors, Elaine May deserves a Best Supporting Actress 
Oscar nomination next year for her delightful, and lovable, turn as May, who 
is brought into the action when Frenchy (May's cousin) hires her to help sell 
the cookies while Ray and his comrades sneakily dig and drill in the back, 
dead set on finding their way to the bank through the ground. Ray and Frenchy 
figure May is so ditzy that she won't realize what is going on, but when 
asked by customers about the racket in the back, she blindly tells them the 
matter-of-fact truth. A climactic scene, set at the home of a wealthy couple 
(Elaine Stritch, George Grizzard) whom Ray plans to swap a highly valuable 
jewel necklace from, and who uses May as a coverup downstairs at the party, 
gains much of its momentum not only from Allen's comic timing, but from May's 
charm and effortless comedic abilities. In the only other major role, Hugh 
Grant stars as David, a British aristocrat whom Frenchy hires to educate her 
on art and culture. </P>
<P>Despite its advertising, "Small Time Crooks" is not a film about a bank heist 
(that ultimately only takes up the first half-hour of the picture), but a 
truly winning comedy about a couple whose hearts lie in their small, but 
agreeable, lives, and the journey they must go through to realize that money 
is not the key to happiness. A simple moral, to be sure, but one that fits 
comfortably within the confines of "Small Time Crooks," Allen's first motion 
picture of the 21st-century, and, no doubt, one of his brightest and sunny in 
years.</P>
