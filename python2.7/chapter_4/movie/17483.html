Running time: 97 minutes. </P>
<P>This contemporary, steamy and hip version of Dangerous
Liaisons is aimed at the cinema literate, adolescent audience of the
'90's.</P>
<P>In updating Choderlos De Laclos' 1782 novel of debauchery,
deception and sexual betrayal to the 20th century, first time director
Roger Kumble reaffirms the timelessness of the story and its themes.
He maintains the essential ideas of the original novel, but brings a
hip, street wise sensibility to the plot and breathes new life into
the self absorbed, ruthless characters.  Kumble still sets this modern
version amidst a world of wealth and immense privilege, in which the
beautiful people arrogantly believe that the normal rules of society
do not apply to them.
          Sebastian Valmont (the hunky Ryan Phillippe) and his beautiful
step sister Kathryn (Sarah Michelle Gellar, from I Know What You Did
Last Summer, and tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, etc) desperately lust
after each other.  Left alone in their plush Manhattan apartment while
their parents holiday, they direct their energies into seducing many
of their contemporaries and then casually destroying their
reputations.</P>
<P>But the stakes are dramatically upped when Sebastian sets out
to seduce Annette (Reese Witherspoon, recently seen in Pleasantville,
etc), the daughter of his school's new headmaster.  In a recent
magazine interview Annette publicly avowed to maintain her virginity
until she marries the man she loves.  Meanwhile, Kathryn sets out to
tarnish the reputation of Cecile (newcomer Selma Blair), the new girl
friend of an ex-lover who dumped her in humiliating circumstances.  At
stake is Sebastian's prized 1956 vintage Jaguar.  But Sebastian has
underestimated the cunning of his manipulative sister, who is willing
to play people off against one another, especially when the stakes are
so high and personal.</P>
<P>Neither the contemporary setting, the hunky young cast, nor
the cutting edge soundtrack detract from the savage nature of the
amoral games that the pair play for their own sense of personal
gratification.  There is more than a whiff of sex here, although some
fans may be disappointed to learn they don't get to see Buffy in the
buff.</P>
<P>The charismatic and handsome Phillipe (the best thing in the
recent 54) continues to impress with another superb performance.  He
conveys Sebastian's transformation from cynical, shallow cad, and
gives the flashy character some unexpected depth.  Gellar relishes
this opportunity to play against type, and is superb as the bitchy and
manipulative Kathryn, who is prepared to use anyone to achieve her
aims.  Witherspoon is also good as the vulnerable and naive Annette,
the intended victim of these dangerous games who unexpectedly
triumphs.  Oscar winner Louise Fletcher, Swoosie Kurtz and Christine
Baranski round out the cast in smaller roles as some of the adult
characters caught up in the cruel machinations.</P>
<P>Cruel Intentions has a sophisticated style that will also
strongly appeal to an adult audience not normally drawn towards
shallow teen dramas.</P>
