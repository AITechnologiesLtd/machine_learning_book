<P>It's unusual, but every once in a while there comes a movie that is utterly
unpredictable, one that starts with an idea and takes the viewer off in
every possible direction. "Being John Malkovich" is one such film. So often
we see movies that start off with a good idea and go absolutely nowhere,
getting lost in a predictable plot and contrived sitcom-friendly situations.
Not this one. This film explores every possible angle that could be derived
from its admittedly bizarre premise. The film is a funny, entertaining,
thought-provoking original. It's truly amazing this film actually got made
with studio backing, considering it's practically unmarketable.
Nevertheless, "Being John Malkovich" is here, and we're all better off for
it. It's the most creative film of the year.</P>
<P>John Cusack stars as Craig Schwartz, an out-of-work puppeteer who longs for
the chance to become famous through his craft. Pushed by his wife Lotte
(Cameron Diaz) into getting a steady job, he becomes a filing clerk for the
company on the 7½ floor (don't ask). While working in his office, Craig
discovers a portal in the wall that leads into the head of John Malkovich,
allowing him to see through the actor's eyes for fifteen minutes. Craig lets
Maxine (Catherine Keener), a co-worker he is attracted to, in on the secret.
The opportunistic Maxine convinces Craig to turn the portal into a tourist
attraction, and it becomes a huge hit. Complications ensue when Lotte visits
Malkovich's brain while Maxine is seducing him, and the two women find they
are attracted to each other . . . but only through Malkovich. The situation
grows ever more bizarre when Malkovich himself realizes what has been going
on, and Craig learns how to control his new "puppet."</P>
<P>This film takes a lot of chances, the biggest of which may be in taking its
most marketable stars and robbing them of their glamour. Cusack and Diaz
play so far against type that I was barely able to recognize them (it took
me 20 minutes to realize Diaz was even in the movie). Both actors acquit
themselves nicely. Cusack's bemused nature is perfect for the part of Craig,
and Diaz delivers an unexpectedly touching performance as his homely wife.
Catherine Keener, so wasted in "8mm," plays the femme fatale to delicious
perfection-every one of her lines drips with contempt for the smitten Craig.
As for the title character himself, Malkovich must first be given credit for
his willingness to go along with such a self-deprecating premise, and then
given accolades for a truly brilliant performance. The actor begins by
playing what is supposed to be himself, but seems more like a composite of
how the general public pictures him. He must then pull off something even
more difficult, which is to take on the personality of whoever is inside his
head. When Craig learns to control his body, Malkovich makes a notable shift
into playing John Cusack. He does it so well that I eventually forgot he was
acting; it really seemed like John Cusack inside John Malkovich. It's most
likely the best work he has ever done.</P>
<P>The screenplay, by Charlie Kaufman, is quite simply one of the most
inventive and clever screenplays to be released in a long while. "Being John
Malkovich" has a seemingly endless supply of clever ideas and jokes. It has
hilarious sight gags, like the "half-floor" Craig works on that causes
everyone to stoop down constantly, a fact most of Craig's coworkers seem
blissfully unaware of. There are classic supporting characters, like the
lecherous old Dr. Lester (Orson Bean), who believes he has a speech
impediment because his secretary (Mary Kay Place) mishears everything said
to her. Numerous self-parodying cameos by Hollywood stars (Charlie Sheen,
Brad Pitt, Sean Penn) crop up, each more surprising than the last. The
laughs come consistently in "Being John Malkovich," and best of all, they
are of the subtle and intelligent variety. The film unapologetically resides
in the absurd for its entire running time. If you're willing to buy into its
skewed sense of reality, you'll have a great ride.</P>
<P>What's truly most admirable about this film is that it doesn't shy away from
any exploration of its central idea. There are countless issues raised by
and possible ramifications resulting from entering another man's head, and
"Being John Malkovich" eschews conventional (read: formula) movie plots to
explore all of them. A less ambitious film might have gone for sappy
sentimentalism or cheap jokes with a predictable story, but this one
actually surprised me fairly consistently. I was never certain where the
story was going, and I loved discovering it. Nearly any pressing question
about the premise one might ask is explored. For example, what happens if
someone learns to control Malkovich? What if Malkovich went inside his own
head? What if more than one person takes control? What if there are others
who have people inside their heads? Most films might only explore one or
fewer of these possibilities. "Being John Malkovich" explores all of them.</P>
<P>There are plenty of mind-bending issues raised by the film that it is sure
to become the topic of many a late-night dorm room conversation. It raises
questions about the nature of celebrity, and why we are fascinated by them.
(Perhaps the film's best joke is that no one can name one of Malkovich's
films, even though everyone recognizes him.) It raises issues of
self-identity and role-playing. (Is it a coincidence we are sent into the
brain of an actor?) It raises issues of homosexuality and sexuality in
general. In fact, there are so many pressing ideas brought up by this film,
it would be pointless to try to list them all. I'll just leave it at this:
After seeing "Being John Malkovich," it's hard to figure just who is pulling
anyone's strings, including your own. A film that can accomplish that is
definitely doing something right.</P>
<P>A film as creative as "Being John Malkovich" doesn't get made very often. It
's funny, inventive, and unpredictable. It may have some difficulty reaching
mainstream audiences because it's so far "out there." After all, this film
takes place in a distorted reality, one in which people don't find the
concept of going into someone else's head remotely unusual. All they see it
as is a business venture, or a new toy. Some may find this hard-to-swallow,
but the removal of what might have been used as an easy comic device helps
make the issues that much clearer. Whatever one may think of it, "Being John
Malkovich" is probably the most original film to be released through
Hollywood in the past few years, and it's definitely a must-see.</P>
