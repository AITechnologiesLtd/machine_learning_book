<P>        "Rounders," the new film from John Dahl, tells the complex story
of two young men enslaved by the lure of professional gambling.  Mike
McDermott (Matt Damon) is an ambitious young law student who swears off
high-stakes wagering after he loses a semester's tuition on a single hand
of poker.  But when his aptly-named friend Worm (Edward Norton), a
recently paroled convict, finds himself in serious financial trouble, the
loyal Mike agrees to come out of retirement and help him earn the $15,000
he desperately needs to pay off his bad debts.  With Mike acting as the
yin to Worm's slimy yang, the two card wizards set off to conquer the
poker tables of Atlantic City.  They know all the tricks, and though Mike
prefers to play "straight" poker (ie, no cheating), Worm is not above
stacking the deck or dealing from the bottom.  That's one of their major
differences: Mike approaches poker as an art form, while Worm's point of
view is much less noble.</P>
<P>        Matt Damon's performance radiates warmth and sunshine, loyalty
and charismatic charm.  His character is obviously intelligent and kind-
hearted: the only reason he returns to gambling is to assist a friend in
need.  He seems genuinely interested in his law studies when we meet him,
and positively worships his girlfriend Jo (Gretchen Mol).  What most
astounded me was how a sweet guy like this could surround himself with
such monsters.  It's so painfully obvious that Worm is a user, with no
interest in anything but Mike's card-playing abilities, that we wonder
why such a smart young man can't see this for himself.  The smarmy Jo,
meanwhile, is constantly whining or striding away from Mike with her nose
upturned, as though she believes she's far too good for him; never once
does she demonstrate any degree of kindness or affection.  When she
leaves midway through the movie, I rejoiced... and was quite surprised to
learn that Mike (and the film) considered her departure a bad thing.</P>
<P>        "Rounders" is a disappointing tale, more concerned with creating
individual moments rather than a consistent tone.  The story's pulse is
only discernible during the card-playing scenes, which are fascinating and
masterfully constructed; the rest of the film tries to involve us in plot
details which are not only irrevelant but actually boring.  These include
Mike and Jo's tepid romance, Mike's steadily declining interest in his
school work, Worm repeatedly getting himself in trouble and asking Mike
for help, etc.</P>
<P>        The movie also makes poor use of its first-rate cast, apart from
Damon.  What's Martin Landau, one of America's greatest living actors,
doing in this film?  The answer: not much.  Landau, who won as Oscar for
his portrayl of Bela Lugosi in Tim Burton's "Ed Wood," plays a kindly old
mentor, the type always present in movies like this.  Although his
performance is fine, he doesn't really do anything except give Damon some
money.  John Malkovich, another fine actor, portrays a Russian cardshark
named KGB in the film's opening and closing scenes; unfortunately, the
performance is so paper-thin and insubstantial that Damon could've
defeated him merely by blowing hard.  In addition, Malkovich's Russian
accent is laughable: I kept expecting him to announce, "Time to look for
Moose and Squirrel, Natasha!"</P>
<P>        The end of the film is supposed to leave us feeling cheerful and
uplifted, but a true happy ending would depict Mike and Worm checking
themselves into "Gamblers Anonymous."  The film's glorification of its
subject matter, coupled with the fact that Jo and Mike appear to reconcile
at the end of the story, caused me to bury my head in my hands and weep
silently until the end credits began to roll.</P>
