<P>DOUBLE PLATINUM (ABC - Airing at 9 p.m. May 16, 1999)</P>
<P>        There's a scene in that great trashy movie "Indecent Proposal"
in which lawyer Oliver Platt is approached by two screenwriters who need
his help in selling their big idea to a studio.</P>
<P> "It's a comeback vehicle for Diana Ross!" one beams. "With
Billy Ray Cyrus!" his partner notes.</P>
<P> That proposed picture could scarcely have turned out to any
goofier than "Double Platinum" (airing Sunday at 9 p.m. on ABC), in
which Miss Ross attempts to hitch her long-idle wagon to Brandy's star.
This is the kind of mesmerizingly bad melodrama in which someone bursts
into tears, then rushes to the nearest mirror so she can watch herself
weep.</P>
<P> A number of things make "Platinum" an inexhaustible source of
cheap laughs, but Ross' transcendentally bizarre performance is
certainly the foremost factor. The effortless elegance that was once her
trademark has since been replaced by edgy self-consciousness and a
penchant for wallowing in the hollow, ersatz sincerity Michael Jackson
usually traffics in. Clad in gowns that look like the frilly
monstrosities unlucky girls get stuck wearing to the prom and crooning
half a dozen of the tepid ballads that have kept her far outside the Top
40 for the past 15 years, Ross is often a sorry sight.</P>
<P> Though she won justifiable acclaim for her portrayal of Billie
Holiday in "Lady Sings the Blues," Ross quickly lost whatever bearings
she had as an actress; witness her stilted star turns in "Mahogany" and
"The Wiz" for evidence of that. Playing a performer shouldn't be too
much of a stretch for her, but Ross invests many of her lines in
"Platinum" with the same level of emotionalism most people use when
reading from the phone book.</P>
<P> Nina Shengold's unintentionally uproarious teleplay takes two
hours to lay out what '80s R&B group Klymaxx once said in four funky
minutes: Divas need love, too. In a prologue set in 1981 Atlanta, we're
introduced to aspiring songstress Olivia Harris (Ross, shot in such soft
focus she looks like a five-foot stack of cotton candy in a bad wig)
who's approached by a silver-tongued devil of an agent after one of her
allegedly knockout sets.</P>
<P> He wants her to run away to New York; being a mother and a
wife, Olivia hesitates. "Don't throw away a dream like this, kid --
life's too short," he tells her, sounding like someone who O.D.'d on
Busby Berkeley musicals.</P>
<P> So Olivia does what any mom would. She goes home, wrings her
lovely hands over another one of her wild-eyed husband Adam's (Brian
Stokes Mitchell) poker games ("Don't worry about that mess -- you can
clean it up in the morning," hubby cheerfully tells her) and then turns
to her infant daughter Kayla for advice. "Tell me what to do," Olivia
whispers to the baby and although it's unlikely the child replied "hit
the road," that's Olivia's next move.</P>
<P> Fast-forward 18 years, and Kayla, still clueless about her
mom's true identity, has turned into an exotic beauty who wins dinner
with the now-successful Olivia in a radio contest. Yes, the mother and
child reunion is only a filet mignon away, but when Olivia drops her
little love bomb, Kayla crabs she wants nothing to do with "America's
crown princess, who does everything for needy children, but left one of
her own behind."</P>
<P> Can the promise of superstardom override the heartache of
abandonment? Olivia thinks so, and uses her clout and connections to
turn Kayla into a sensation. This is one of those stories in which the
wide-eyed ingenue comes to New York one day, lands an agent and a record
deal before unpacking her bags and has the Number Two song in America
before week's end. But even though mom goes to extremes to please, there
are still trials aplenty before the big finale in which Kayla struts her
stuff in front of a sold-out audience of the best-behaved teens in
history. It's easily the least credible concert scene since Barbra
Streisand sang "Woman in the Moon" to silence an arena full of rowdy
rockers in "A Star Is Born."</P>
<P> At least the producers of "Platinum" allowed Brandy to throw a
couple of her hits ("Have You Ever?" and "Almost Doesn't Count") on the
soundtrack, although the woefully staged production number that
accompanies "Happy" is embarassingly silly with some of the worst
choreography since the last Lynda Carter variety special.</P>
<P> As evidenced by her work in her UPN series "Moesha" and last
year's "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer," Brandy the actress has a
certain quiet charm. When she tries to convey rage or grief however,
she's well outside her range and the results are amateurish. In her
defense, the character of Kayla as written seems almost schizoid, going
from cherub to shrew and back at the drop of a hat.</P>
<P> Like any piece of classic cheese, "Platinum" gives both its
stars several memorably overwrought  lines: "I was a real person once,"
"You don't get any prizes for abandoning your baby," and "Let me mend
your heart, even though I'm the one who broke it" are some choice
examples. Yes, this is a terrible movie, gracelessly directed by Robert
Allan Ackerman and crowned by a would-be showstopping disco romp by Ross
that shouldn't give Cher any sleepless nights. But for fans of
high-gloss nonsense, there hasn't been anything to equal this since
Whitney Houston was cast as an Oscar-nominated actress in "The
Bodyguard." Fiascos of this magnitude don't come along every day and
deserve to be savored. James Sanford</P>
