<P>    "I don't believe in fate," says Erin Castleton (Hope Davis), the
wistful heroine looking for love in NEXT STOP WONDERLAND, but _someone_
calling the shots on contemporary romantic comedy sure does.  SLEEPLESS IN
SEATTLE became a huge hit introducing two destined lovers who only meet in
the film's final scene; a few years later, 'TIL THERE WAS YOU also told a
tale of lovers-to-be leading parallel lives until the closing credits
start to roll.  Earlier this year, SLIDING DOORS offered yet another
speculative stab at how and why we meet our soulmates. Something in the
zeitgeist has film-makers falling over themselves to convince us that Mr.
or Ms. Right is out there, somewhere, just waiting for us to go to the
right party or step on the right elevator.</P>
<P>     NEXT STOP WONDERLAND falls into that category, but only in the most
nominal sense.  It does follow the never-quite-converging lives of two
discontented singles, these two in contemporary Boston.  Erin is a nurse
in the middle of the latest of a series of serial break-ups with her
activist boyfriend (Philip Seymour Hoffman); Alan Monteiro (Alan Gelfant)
is a 35-year-old former plumber trying to break with his working class
background and become a marine biologist.  The narrative follows each of
them on the trials and tribulations of their respective lives, Erin
dealing with responses to a personal ad placed for her by her mother
(Holland Taylor), Alan fending off the advances of a fellow student (Cara
Buono) while trying to avoid the wrath of his loan shark Frank (Victor
Argo).</P>
<P>     The reason NEXT STOP WONDERLAND never feels exactly like a fated
romance is that it feels so grounded in the simple reality of its
protagonist.  Hope Davis is an irresistable presence as Erin, a wannabe
cynic whose romanticism bursts through in her love of her late father's
poetry.  It's as complete a female characterization as we've seen this
year -- she's smart, clever, just vulnerable enough that you feel for her,
just tough enough that you trust her.  And it doesn't hurt that she
anchors the best set-up in the script by Brad Anderson and Lyn Vaus, with
a string of would-be suitors, each more unappealing than the last, leaving
hilarious messages on the personal ad's phone line.  Anderson directs
with a 1990s Woody Allen vibe, complete with jump edits and hand-held
camera work, yet the film never comes off as derivative of either the
Allen oeuvre or other SLEEPLESS-style comedies.  A character who grabs
your interest can do that for a story.</P>
<P>     NEXT STOP WONDERLAND is always Erin's story, which makes Alan's half
of the film a very long introduction to "the other guy."  Gelfant is
appealing in a low-key way, but he never gets the audience as emotionally
invested in Alan's hopes and dreams as Davis does in Erin's.  He also has
to contend with a silly sub-plot involving a shady real estate developer
(Robert Klein) with an axe to grind against the aquarium where Alan
volunteers.  The time wasted on Alan kidnapping a balloonfish and dealing
with the buffoonish Frank could have been used to develop a relationship
between Alan and his father, who casts a long shadow on Alan's
aspirations.  Everything involving Alan is secondary to everything
involving Erin.</P>
<P>     The odd fringe benefit of this imbalance is that it takes the focus
off the question that dogged other films employing this gimmick:  why
should we think these two people belong together?  Our concern rests
squarely with Erin; we want her to be happy, whether that's with Alan, the
Brazilian charmer (Jose Zuniga) who catches her fancy, or even alone.
The coda which has been added since the film screened at the Sundance Film
Festival makes that concern even more central.  The ending is no longer
happy just because these two people meet, but because it looks like they
could be happy together, and Davis's delightful performance invests us
in her happiness.  NEXT STOP WONDERLAND is a sweet and entertaining fairy
tale not just because she finds Prince Charming, but because the one fate
we care about -- Erin's fate -- is the only one the film is realy
concerned with.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 small wonders:  7.</PRE>
