<PRE>The Prince of Egypt</PRE>
<P>The best scene in _The Prince of Egypt_, a modern animated retelling of
_The Ten Commandments_, occurs after Moses visits God at the burning
bush.  He meets his wife, Tzipporah, and giddily tells her the news,
dances with her, and she steps back slowly in a quiet wonderment.  No
dialogue is heard.  This is all done in pantomime, as Hans Zimmer's
score annunciates what's on the screen.</P>
<P>I highlight this to distinguish what makes _PoE_ different from nearly
ANY other animated film I could remember.  It isn't a typical scene.
In any other film, the (redundant) dialogue would be heard, the
violins would screech to represent Tzipporah's response, and all of
this would occur at an extreme close-up.  Not here.  If Orson Welles
had directed this film, he would have done the same thing.</P>
<P>This film is so gloriously _cinematic_ that it's poetry.  There are
scenes in this film work so visually well that it speaks on multiple
levels.  Take the scene where Moses confronts Rameses and firstborn, in
front of the hieroglyphic indicating the drowning of Hebrew children.
Rameses' son is in the middle of the frame, perfectly situated in the
hieroglyphic jaws of death.  Not only is it a conversation of the
terrible past, but it is a foreshadowing of the worst plague to come.</P>
<P>There's a scene where the young Moses confronts "the man he calls
father", Pharoah Seti.  The backdrop is a giant statue of Seti, and
when they speak, Seti's face matches that of the great monument behind
him.  It's as if young Moses were confronting not just Pharoah, but
centuries-old traditions and authority.  Brilliant.</P>
<P>Then there are the technological achievements that weren't even
possible a few years ago.  Not just the parting of the Red Sea--we've
seen that bit in the coming attractions--but how about the water in
the opening sequence, when Baby Moses is placed in a basket in the
river.  The river itself, swishes, rolls, and plain darn LOOKS LIKE A
REAL RIVER.</P>
<P>Much of Pharoah's kingdom has a scope and greatness that has been
compared to David Lean.  Thousands of extras have been replicated, but
there are no false images.  Even those individuals at a great distance
have an authenticity to them.</P>
<P>The voices are also well done.  Val Kilmer is not my first choice for
Moses, but he brings about a fine metamorphisis: from fun-loving
prankster in the opening reel to dynamic leader.  (I have to remind
myself: didn't he get his start with the sophmoric comedies _Top
Secret!_ and _Real Genius_? ) Ralph Fiennes does an admirable job as
the Pharoah Ramses, and Patrick Stewart even brings in some dignity as
the Pharoah Seti.  Michelle Pfieffer (as Tzipporah) and Martin Short
(as the sorcerer Huy) are the least recognizable, while Jeff Goldblum
(Aaron) and Sandra Bullock (Miriam) have more familiar vocal =
mannerisms.</P>
<P>I can now attest that, after trudging several years through
_Anastasia_ and _Hercules_, the songs _are_ memorable once again.
_When You Believe_ is probably Oscar bound, and only lacks when sung
by the divas Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston.  (That's because it
works better if it were sung simply, not throwing in every nuance of
"ooh-whooah-aaah" that Mariah and Whitney are known for).  Also,
Baby's Lullaby and Heaven's Eyes are also catchy.</P>
<P>None of these tremendous advances in animation, catchy tunes and great
acting would be worth a cent if the story driving it didn't demand
such respect.  And here, in the year of the "tell me a story" film
(_Men With Guns_, _Smoke Signals_, even _Saving Private Ryan_), we
have the mother of all stories.  This is a story that, according to
Deuteronomy, was commanded to be told in every household, for all
generations.</P>
<P>Who doesn't want to relate to a reluctant hero with a nearly
impossible task, demand justice and freedom for the oppressed?  When
God calls Moses to pursue this task, you can see Moses' weakness, his
tremor, his uncertainty.  When he initially fails to have Ramses
relent his torture, the Israelites complain that Moses is making it
worse for them.  Yet somehow he's steadfast, he prevails, follows
strange orders (drop your rod--it will turn to a snake, put the blood
of a lamb over your doorposts), and acheives the impossible.  When
Moses was inbetween the Red Sea and thousands of angry Egyptian
warriors, God had made a way where there was no way.</P>
<P>For all that familiarity, the story is still most poignant and
powerful.  It still speaks many things to many different people,
liberals, conservatives, Jews, Christians, Muslims, atheists, rich,
poor, and so on.  Jeff Goldblum, in a radio interview, raved that this
is a story that, the deeper you look into it, the more you get out of
it.  I couldn't agree more.</P>
<P>Will kids dig it?  I hope so.  But this film isn't for kids, but for
everybody.  The makers at Dreamworks have a philosophy that animation
isn't necessarily a category of itself, but a vehicle to bring about a
story, _any_ story.</P>
<P>_The Prince of Egypt_ is a seminal film.  It will be remembered for
years to come, not only on anniversaries during religious feasts, but
for its' landmark understanding of film, period.  I don't think I'm
exaggerating that this may take animation where _Citizen Kane_ took
mainstream film nearly sixty years ago.</P>
