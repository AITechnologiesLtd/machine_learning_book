<P>The ability to suspend ones disbelief is a vital trait when attending a
Schwarzengger movie. However, due to the absence of a good film from the big
Austrian for quite some time, people seem to have forgotten this. The biggest
complaint I hear about "End of Days" is that it was unbelievable. I'm sorry,
but I personally believe it is incredibly naive to expect Arnold to appear in a
realistic film.</P>
<P>Twenty years ago, a newborn girl was chosen by a Satanic cult to be the one who
would bear the child of Satan. Now, young Christine (Robin Tunney) is grown up
and is being stalked by three different groups: Two church factions, one intent
on killing her; and the other, led by Father Kovak (Rod Steiger), attempting to
protect and hide her; the third party is Satan himself, possessing the body of
a Wall Street banker (Gabriel Byrne). Drawn into the conflict are Jericho Cane
(Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Chicago (Kevin Pollak), two bodyguards hired by the
man they do not know to be Satan. As Cane is drawn deeper and deeper into the
conflict, he learns that Christine must not be impregnated or the world will
come to an end. </P>
<P>If you don't like Arnold movies, chances are you already know to steer clear of
this one. If this somehow hasn't occured to you, let me reassure you that this
is a Schwarzenegger film in the truest sense, so stay far away. Being a typical
film of the Schwarzenegger genre, this movie is a whole lot of fun, but be sure
to leave your brain and sense of logic at the door. There are more plot holes
here than I can begin to count. This movie isn't about plot though. It's about
fight scenes, explosions and special effects. These are certainly present in
abundance.</P>
<P>On the down side, the acting here is certainly less than phenomenal from the
leads. As all know, Arnold isn't going to get any Oscar nominations in the near
future. However, he is charismatic enough to get away with this. Robin Tunney,
on the other hand, is likely to get nominated for at least one award, and
that's the Razzie. Not only is she laughably bad in this role, but she looks
utterly dumbfounded as to what she's supposed to be doing half the time. As for
the rest of the cast, Rod Steiger is as good as ever; Kevin Pollak is certainly
in his element as a smart alec of a side-kick; and CCH Pounder, a remarkable
actress, is woefully underused as a police detective. The real standout
performance here comes from Gabriel Byrne as The Man (this is how he's
credited) himself. Byrne simply oozes charm and authority. Watch for a scene in
which he meets a skateboarder who disrespects him.</P>
<P>"End of Days" is mindless movie fun nearly at its best. It doesn't quite make
it because the film does border on being too mindless at times. Some of the
scenes we are expected to swallow will have you gawking at the screen in
disbelief (such as how Cane discovers the existence of Christine). If you think
you can get past this, just sit back, relax, and enjoy. "End of Days" runs a
touch too long at 120 minutes. I give it three and a half stars, and a
recommendation to catch a matinee.</P>
