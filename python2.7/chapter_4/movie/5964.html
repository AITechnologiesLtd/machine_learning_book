<PRE>CERTAINLY NO ALCHEMY GOING ON HERE</PRE>
<P>Boy, what a great movie!! Keanu Reeves and Morgan
Freeman acting together, the director of THE FUGITIVE (Andrew Davis)
back again to give us another thriller, and the beautiful Rachel
STEALING BEAUTY Weisz thrown in to boot. How could this not be a
blockbuster? All die-hard Keanu Reeves fans, read on. </P>
<P>Ol "Much Ado About Nothing" plays Eddie Kasalivich, a machinist studying
at the University of Chicago. To help pay for the rent, he takes on this
job making the machinery for a hydrogen project being conducted by the
university. By happy coincidence, he also happens to stumble on the
solution to the final problem and thus is the only one who knows the key
to performing this feat of miracle physics. This project holds great
promise: taking hydrogen from water and giving out more energy than is
put in. A potential solution to the Earth's energy problems without the
pollution cost. Surely nobody could have any problems with that?</P>
<P>Morgan Freeman is Paul Shannon, the project's sponsor. He works for a
very powerful organization that disagrees with the paternal project
leader as to how quickly technology should be released to the public. He
figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the
project are released too quickly. So he murders the project leader,
blows up the project (great but short scene here, sort of like a mini
ID4 city-devastation thing) and tries to simulate the experiment at some
other hi-tech hush-hush location. Unfortunately, our intrepid machinist
and an English physicist (Weisz) manage to get away and now follows a
Fugitive-like chase using a  not too dissimilar rehash of that movie
script.</P>
<P>This movie is just dying for a comparison with "The Fugitive". Both
movies use Chicago as the main city and since the place doesn't change
much, I guess we can't really blame the setting for the paucity of
atmosphere. The trouble here is that where THE FUGITIVE had Harrison
Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, CHAIN REACTION only has Keanu Reeves and Fred
Ward. Credit to them, but we aren't really given much of a chance to
empathise with the characters. Where Ford was able to work within the
confines of the movie to evoke sympathy, Eddie Kasalivich just doesn9t
seem very believeable and Reeves' character is never given the time to
develop. It might have been a better investment in film to give the
characters more depth and spend less time on the chase sequences, which
frankly, get quite boring after a while.</P>
<P>Harrison Ford was "the man against the world." He was alone in a world
where he didn't know who to trust and it came across real well. In CHAIN
REACTION, Keanu Reeves isn't alone. Now that would be fine if the
fleeing couple had some chemistry and could really portray some
paranoia, vulnerability and confusion. We don't get this. We get him
thinking he's still in SPEED, only now our Sandra Bullock has an English
accent, probably doesn't drive a bus, and hardly contributes anything to
the movie.</P>
<P>The producers here probably thought, "Hey, what if Keanu
and Rachel don't hit it off too well? Let's rope in that Morgan to help
us out." Well, Keanu and Rachel didn't hit it off well on the screen,
and most unfortunately, Morgan Freeman doesn't help much either. The
only thing we come to really know of Paul Shannon is that he always has
a full load of cigars in his cigar holder.  It's not really his fault.
Once again, Andrew Davis just doesn't take the time to build his
characters. Someone must have convinced him that this time round, cinema
dollars are best earned by making the movie run like a headless chicken.</P>
<P>The Flying Inkpot Rating System:
* Wait for the TV2 broadcast.
** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha!
*** Pretty good, bring a friend.
**** Amazing, potent stuff.
***** Perfection. See it twice.</P>
