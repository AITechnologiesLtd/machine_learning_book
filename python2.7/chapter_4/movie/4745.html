<PRE>                       THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST
                       A film review by Ralph Benner
                        Copyright 1996 Ralph Benner</PRE>
<P>     Martin Scorsese had for years wanted to make a movie of Nikos
Kazantzakis's novel THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST. Even if he seemed an
odd choice to do it, because his movies seem so explosively modern and
contentious (MEAN STREETS, TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL), when we got to
know him, through watching his movies, most of them tinged with
Catholicism and alienation, and listening to or reading about him, we
knew he was more than up for the at best dubious challenge: He's just
the right kind of intense, anguished Catholic, completely enveloped by
the mysticism of his religion, to give us a fresh perspective on Christ
as a man. I hope I can say this with support from other recovering
Catholics: I also loved the majesty of the Church -- its physical
grandeur and harmonious theme (that we as people must forgive ourselves
before we can expect to be forgiven by a God, at least that's how I've
always viewed the main tenet of Christianity throughout my Catholic
education) -- and as a teenage moviegoer, I too was overwhelmed by
movies like THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD. The image of Christ was story
book perfect -- the epitome of ethereal iconolatry. But when reaching
adulthood, and trying to make sense of what I now see as legend, my
view of Christ got tarnished: He was no longer Max von Sydow. Scorsese
succinctly puts it this way about what he wouldn't do: "I didn't want a
Christ who glowed in the dark."</P>
<P>     Chief among the reasons religion is appealing to many is that
there is no answer to the earthly finality of death, so therefore we
hope there is something more, something beyond death, a God or supreme
power with an eternity of answers. It is a matter of faith, yet maybe
more realistically a matter of comfort. (Or, as C.S. Lewis might
suggest, a way to avoid the fear of death as nothingness.) But out of
this beautiful simplicity comes the various roads to God, each so
detoured by hidden mines of biased interpretation and dictatorship that
poor put-upon Madalyn Murray-O'Hair is right -- religion has caused
mankind more misery and death than any other single idea in history.
(It certainly would be hard to argue that the idea has brought us
everlasting peace and love -- its primary goals.) The lasting power of
the God myth to believers isn't that they've seemingly resolved death,
it's in accepting otherworld perfection -- something we can't really
relate to or achieve, something we can only be in awe of through
imagination. Realism, then, becomes the enemy. While it's hard to
comprehend all the arguments being made against Scorsese's film, the
easiest to understand is that fundamentalist Christians vehemently
reject as blasphemy the notion that a God, in this case a God's "son"
named Christ, can be viewed as a human being and therefore subject to
all human temptations. At the very core of Scorsese's belief is that
his God sent his own son as a man of human flesh and blood and possible
moral weakness precisely so that we could relate to him, and it's an
admirable, if not altogether impossible position to take, because soon
after it's unveiled, up pop so many contradictions and inconsistencies
that, while we sure as hell aren't getting "a glow in the dark" Christ,
we start hoping for one. Scorsese's naturalism exposes how rigged the
religious game is.</P>
<P>     In the 8/21/88 issue of the Los Angeles Times entertainment
tabloid Calender, Lawrence Christon (honest, that's his name) wrote,
"The protesters represent a much larger group of the alienated and
disaffected, whose spiritual hunger has never been truly satiated. In
THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST they see not only the deadly literalness
of the reified image that displaces the spiritual imagination, but they
also sense that this one last apprehension of divine purity, this
single incorruptible ideal that they've held against the manifold
pollutions of the modern world, has been taken away from them and used
up by the movie." To paraphrase Blanche in A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE,
they don't want realism, they want magic. Perhaps this explains why
George Stevens' THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD was far less successful
with critics than with the alienated and disaffected. When Stevens made
his epic, his goal was to fuse reverence with skepticism by using
nature as the bond; the huge panoramas of his colored Ansel Adams-like
locales were used to enhance the basic belief that there had to be
something that or someone who created it all. Stevens also knew that to
succeed he had to re-define the sepulchral trap that often befalls the
actor playing Christ, performing as the "receptacle of sacred relics."
Max von Sydow is the very essence of Michelangelo or Raphael, and his
screen persona seems otherworldly.  Nevertheless, he managed to get all
the epigrams and platitudes to resonate with stunning clarity of
meaning. The big Cinerama screen helped as well -- the magic had
magnified power. (Some of us still remember, in the original roadshow
version of the movie before United Artist unmercifully cut it, the
"dropping" of the thirty pieces of coin on the soundtrack during
Judas's betrayal.) More significantly, there is no "real thing" about
Von Sydow to trouble us, even if right now most of us claim to only
want reality. Von Sydow's as far from real as Charlton Heston is as
Moses -- we feel safe, secure in the knowledge that Stevens isn't going
to explode possible falsehoods.</P>
<P>     But it is the "real" in Christ that Scorsese as artist and
troubled Catholic searched for in THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST, and it
would have been hypocritical of him to make a movie that supported the
other kind of view. That in the end he concluded that there was
resistance to temptation and that he actually deviated little from
mythology says this about Scorsese: he's deeply respectful. And
certainly far more than the dummmy-headed protestors who never bothered
to see the movie they feigned distress over. (Sound familiar? Rather
like Dole screaming about violence in movies he's never seen while
avoiding condemnation of the violence in movies made by Arnold and
Bruce, who support his drearidacy.) Yet in weighing his sincere
intentions with what's on the screen, the movie, very much like the
novel, is a failure. There's naturalism to a degree: the movie has the
most realistic look yet at what Judea might have been like, and the
spikes being hammered into Christ's flesh are terrifyingly big, and we
get Christ questioning and fearful of his father's plans -- but there's
no spell. The center is severely crippled by Willem Defoe as Jesus.
Unfair as it is, too many of us spend our time looking at the spaces
between his teeth, and it is exactly that kind of visual handicap we
don't need to deal with. If an actor playing the most discussed and
mythicized figure of western civilization attempts to play him as an
emotional, mental maelstrom, it has to be a performance ripped from
within the character he's portraying, without the burden of
distractions. After all, it is this daring conception that is the very
heart of the novel and what Scorsese aimed for. How can we become
involved with the interpretation when the actor's defects overshadow
it? Defoe is also torn in another direction -- he's less the novel's
Christ than he is Scorsese as Christ. (De Niro's least satisfying work
in his movies with Scorsese comes when he too plays Scorsese instead of
his characters.) Most of the yahoo fundamentalists who see the movie
will not notice the substitution, but for the movie lovers out there,
the resemblance of Defoe's urban intensity, his wiry nervousness, his
manic jabberishness to Scorsese's is unquestionable, and so the element
of the natural Scorsese wants and we want for him gets lost. The result
is that not only does Kazantzakis's Christ get usurped, so does Christ
himself.</P>
<P>     I found myself surprised by some commendable things in the movie:
Harvey Keitel's Judas is a man already out to kill Jesus and after he
discovers the beauty behind the Christian message, he is torn between
love and betrayal; both could be divinely-inspired duty. To see this
view of him realized without apology is -- I can't resist it --
miraculous.  Watching Christ dancing, drinking, contemplating
fornication with Mary Magdalene will be labeled as blasphemy by the
blankhead religious but how could Christ resist temptation without
first recognizing what it is? If Christ has foreknowledge that he'll
succeed in resisting, what is the lesson for imperfect man? It's brave
that the cannibalistic aspect of Catholicism gets its sickie due --
that we see wine turned into blood.  (This ritual is as repulsive as it
is infantile.) The dream sequence, wherein Christ contemplates
temptation, is a mistake in conception: not only too long but
unconvincing; you can hardly wait till Christ rejects what Lucifer
offers. Sex and children barely make it as lures into the lair of the
devil. They're integral, are they not, to a God's master plan?  (It was
St. Boniface who said, "Man's road to God always begins with a sexual
act." That's why I reject the Virgin Birth and priest celibacy -- they
undermine the strength of the family. Think about how the Church
glorifies men, represses women, demands the faithful to accept the
dictums of supposed celibates -- one of whom claims inhuman
infallibility. How can so exclusive a fraternity pretend to be an
advocate of "the family" when so much of what it celebrates undermines
the family's strength?) Though Scorsese's temptations are all subduedly
played out, you find yourself wishing for a few De Mille orgies as an
entertainment reprieve. Peter Gabriel's music comes on with such
African-Brazilian roots that I wondered if it weren't lifted from some
of Sergio Mendes's less commercial recordings, like "Primal Roots."
Still, it's potent stuff, and heavily so during the slow-motion walk
Christ endures at the beginning of his crucifixion. With Jews smiling
and laughing and mocking him from behind, it's likely to be recognized
as the movie's most memorable, if not controversial moment. Adding to
the power of this scene are two women on either side of Christ, in the
foreground. Their faces are exaggeratedly compelling and repulsive --
you want to slap them out of sight.</P>
<P>     Putting aside one's admiration of Scorsese's courage to make
TEMPTATION, it's an an oddly indifferent movie made by a man so
committed to his religious spirituality: the story has neither a
mythological nor intellectual hold of us. Hard as Scorsese tries, he
can't unleash the power of the myth; the defiantly implausible material
acts as its own gainsayer. Inevitable it is: when you dance with
religious myth, you end up with blisters filled with contradiction. No
matter how you finagle the material, you get trapped by its
preposterousness, not too unlike how creation scientists get trapped by
their blatant dismissal of not the theory but fact of evolution. The
best you can do is avoid disgracing yourself, which as novelist
Kazantzakis and as movie maker Scorsese managed to do. THE LAST
TEMPTATION OF CHRIST is Scorsese being true to himself; he's been
tortured for what to viewers seems like aeons by befuddled beliefs and
remains so. And he can not be accused of being a blasphemer or a
hypocrite to his masochistic pleasures. His tango, however, is over:
Realism has no function in religion.</P>
