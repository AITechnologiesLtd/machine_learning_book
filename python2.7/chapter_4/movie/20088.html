<P>Every summer, there is at least one movie that gets caught in the landslide
of film releases, and gets lost in the shuffle. Unfortunately for DETROIT
ROCK CITY, it appears as though it has fallen victim to the BLAIR WITCH
hype, a lousy marketing campaign, and the lack of "name" stars to attract
its first weekend audience. But don't let that discourage you, folks...this
is one fun movie!!!</P>
<P>PLOT:
Set in the late 70s, four wryly teenage boys spend an entire day and night
trying to get to Detroit to attend a KISS concert. On their way, they are
led astray by various obstacles including Elvis the hall monitor, the
church-loving mom, Disco geeks and their own stupidity. Rock 'n roll music
burns throughout.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
I had a blast at this movie!!! This is a fast-paced, rock 'n roll
soundtrack-induced joyride of nostalgia, hilarity, camera tricks and fun
times! I loved this movie the whole way through, starting with its wonderful
collage of 70s memorabilia credits, the plentitude of references and
in-jokes to all things from that time period, the dead-on performances from
all of its stars, and of course, its satisfyingly predictable finale. I
laughed a lot during this movie, but I was also entranced by the plight of
these kids. I don't think I've ever seen anyone so determined to get
anything in my entire movie-going life! Anyone who's ever had to fight for
something they badly wanted, should be able to relate to these bad-lucked
geeks.</P>
<P>And yes, I also loved the filming style of director Adam Rifkin which went
way over-the-top but managed to mushroom into a perfect match to the rock
music, the "we don't give a fuck" attitude, and all of the wonderfully
cartoonish characters. I'll admit that nostalgia surely had a hand to play
in my over-exuberance for this movie, and maybe I'm just a sucker for shit,
dope and puke jokes, but there was definitely more to this picture than just
those simple factors. All of the actors played their parts flawlessly with
the mom (Lin Shaye) and pothead friend Trip (James DeBello) standing a
little above the rest. The soundtrack was superb, with a constant stream of
songs from the 70s bursting through the background. The settings were also
ideal, with the little touches certifying much authenticity, and more than
anything, the enjoyable, self-mocking style, along with the fun-loving
plight of the youngsters, made this movie an all-around good time. Much like
a moving comic book.</P>
<P>As you can see, the band KISS is not really a major player in this
movie...more like the goal. Now I may be going out on a limb here, but I
predict that this film will find its success in the realm of cult film
status. Natch.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
KISS members: Bassist Gene Simmons' real name is Chaim Witz, and he is born
in Haifa, Israel. Singer/guitarist Paul Stanley was born in Queens, New
York, and his real name is Stanley Eisen. Guitarist Ace Frehley hails from
the Bronx, New York, with his full name coming in at Paul Frehley. While
drummer Peter Criss hails from Brooklyn, New York, and used to be called
Peter Crisscoula.
Shannon Tweed, the actress who seduces Edward Furlong's character in this
movie, was once married to Gene Simmons, the bassist from KISS. She was also
Playboy Playmate of the year in 1982, and sired two kids with the
long-tongued man. She's originally from St-John's, Newfoundland, Canada.
Gene Simmons has also dated actress/singer/all-around weirdos Cher and Diana
Ross.
Edward Furlong got involved in a live-in relationship with his former tutor,
Jacqueline Domac, at the age of 15 (she was 27 at the time). She recently
went to the courts to request 15 percent of Edward's earnings for the last 3
years for abuse and breach of contract.
Natasha Lyonne's real name is Natasha Braunstein. She is currently known to
be dating co-star Edward Furlong.
Porn star Ron Jeremy, known to have a big dick, played the part of the strip
joint announcer in this film. He also had a small part in director Adam
Rifkin's 1994 film, THE CHASE. The IMDb lists him as having been in at least
500 porno movies. Wow. Now that's a lot of porn!
The budget for this film was approximately $15 million, and was filmed
entirely in Canada. Much was done in and around Toronto, including the
Cedabrae Collegiate Institute (high school) in suburban Toronto. The concert
scene was filmed at Copp's Coliseum in nearby Hamilton, Ontario.
Pain in the butt mom, Lin Shaye, has been a staple in all Farrelly Brothers
films. She played the "old lady" Magda, in THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY
(7.5/10), the infamous "landlady" in KINGPIN (8.5/10), and Mrs. Neugeboren
in DUMB AND DUMBER (7.5/10).
Marijuana-head, James DeBello, who plays "Trip" in this movie, also had the
part of "enthusiastic guy" in the summer of 1999's big teen hit AMERICAN PIE
(7/10).
Director Adam Rifkin has also been known to act in many of his own films,
and has also written several side projects. He was one of the co-writers on
SMALL SOLDIERS, and wrote 1997's kid flick THE MOUSE HUNT (6.5/10) all by
himself.
First-time screenwriter Carl V. Dupré, was once the assistant editor on such
classic films like TOP DOG, LEPRECHAUN 2, and BARB WIRE.
Giuseppe Andrews also co-starred opposite Edward Furlong, in one of 1998's
best films, AMERICAN HISTORY X (8.5/10). He portrayed the character of
Jason.
Some of you many remember the drummer in this film, Sam Huntington, from his
starring role in Disney's 1997 film, JUNGLE 2 JUNGLE.</P>
