<P>        When I first saw the preview for Cruel Intentions, I turned to my
friend and said, "Dangerous Liaisons for Kids!"  It was clear to me that
the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense, owing
everything it is to Stephen Frears' 1988 masterpiece.  Imagine my
surprise to see that writer/director Roger Kumble has given credit to
his source material:  Choderlos de Laclos is recognized for his novel
Les Liaisons Dangereuses in the opening credits.  And I was impressed.</P>
<P>        In fact, I was much more impressed with this recognition than with the
actual film, which is an appalling excuse for a movie.  It's kiddie-porn
hackwork, complete with earthy sex-talk and fully-clothed hand-jobs.  I
suppose this kind of movie was inevitable; with all the teen high-school
angst movies coming out, there was certainly room for a pretentious and
laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think they're smarter and
more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined.  Cruel
Intentions is a mess in every possible way, and it fails primarily in
the way I expected it to:  I hated all the characters, and I hate
everything they do.  </P>
<P>        I also hate Ryan Phillippe, so perhaps my opinion is not as objective
as it could be.  Phillippe plays (check out this name) Sebastian
Valmont.  Wow.  Isn't that a memorable name?  I could just say it over
and over again.  Sebastian Valmont.  It kind of rolls off the tongue, in
the spirit of phrases like Sanguine Vapors and Velvet Sandwich. 
Sebastian Valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth; there is
no woman he can't have, no material object out of his reach.  He has all
the money, all the sex -- all at his fingertips.  And, luckily, his
parents never enter into his life -- no, in the world of Cruel
Intentions, adults don't really exist.  The ones who do are irritating.</P>
<P>        Sebastian Valmont lives with his stepsister, Kathryn Merteuil (Sarah
Michelle Gellar), the bitch-queen of the universe, and also the woman
every man wants.  Since these two rich kids are so bored, they only
thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual
liaisons.  Kathryn wants Sebastian Valmont to de-virginize Cecile
Caldwell (Selma Blair), a naive dork-chick who has somehow wronged
Kathryn.  But it's too easy for Sebastian Valmont -- he wants to nail
Annette Hargrove (Reese Witherspoon), the "paradigm of chastity and
beauty."  So, Sebastian Valmont and Kathryn make a deal (which is too
explicit to state here).  But -- dear God! -- Sebastian Valmont actually
begins to fall for poor Annette Hargrove.  </P>
<P>        Dangerous Liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all
believable, and because of its masterful acting.  Cruel Intentions is
bad for many reasons, but it lacks both believable characters and
masterful acting.  Kathryn Merteuil is simply a hateful witch, a girl so
loathsome that I would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her.  She is
supposed to be mean, but Glenn Close gave the character some depth in
Dangerous Liaisons.  Gellar, while aesthetically pleasing, is
one-dimensional and utterly repulsive.  Witherspoon has a truly
beautiful face, but her character isn't the moral staple she's supposed
to be:  sure, she won't have sex until she's in love (is this really a
*moral* issue?), but she does some things in the last few scenes that
are more than a little reprehensible.</P>
<P>        But I can't forget Mr. Phillippe, who continues to exceed my
expectations with his impenetrable, invulnerable blandness.  I have to
give him credit and say that he did, in fact, manage to change his
facial expression about three times during the course of Cruel
Intentions.  And there's one point in the film in which he shouts,
thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone.  True, he
is bad, but it doesn't help that he has no character to work with. 
Kumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character,
leaving us with a sex-crazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic
because he falls in love with a moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch. </P>
<P>        The film fails in every other way, too.  First of all, nobody talks
like this.  Even the "intellectuals" I know don't bother with this kind
of pointless and pretentious yammering.  For a while, the movie looks
like it might play itself for laughs, but it ends up taking itself so
seriously that there's no way we can join it.  Cruel Intentions also
manages to come off as soft-porn in more than one scene.  Earlier I
mentioned a fully-clothed hand-job; this occurs between Kathryn and
Sebastian Valmont, both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point
in the movie.  So, if we hate them, then what's the point of an extended
sex scene?  Titillation, of course.  It can't even work under the
pretense of "meaningful love scene," because we hate the characters.</P>
<P>        It's interesting to note some of the parallels between Cruel Intentions
and Dangerous Liaisons.  Kumble is clearly familiar with the earlier
film; many of the scenes have a similar tone, and there are moments in
Frears' film that Kumble imitates almost completely (such as the last
scene, in which [spoiler warning!] the antagonist is humiliated in front
of her peers).  But kids don't act like this.  Nobody acts like this. 
In his translation, Roger Kumble forgot character development and
sympathy -- some pretty crucial elements.  The result is a picture of
confounding badness, a kiddie-porn mess that thinks it's really deep and
profound.  I'll give Cruel Intentions credit for realizing its
influences, but that doesn't change the fact that it's awful.  </P>
