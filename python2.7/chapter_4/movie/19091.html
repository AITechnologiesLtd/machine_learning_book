<PRE>Things that are purely Austin …</PRE>
<P>`Oh BEHAVE! Felicity Shagwell is one shagadellic babe. Do I make your
horny? Female Fembots with breasts that require gun controlling.
Anything that resembles bananas and two balls of icecream. The
nut-biting finale between Mini Me and Austin. All that body hair is a
real turn on, it's a pity more leading men don't wear it on screen.
Anything that vaguely resembles sausages and eggs. Fat Bastard. The love
scene between Felicity and Fat Bastard, that redefines sex. The wrongly
implied love scene in the tent that redefines anal sex. The love scene
between Austin and Ivana Humpalot, that redefines chess and oral sex.
The love scene between Dr. Evil and Frau Farbissina, that redefines
weird sex. The love affair between Austin and Felicity, that does not
happen, because his Mojo goes missing. The relationship between Dr Evil,
himself and Mini Me which redefines a solo love affair. The unique
relationship between Dr Evil and his son Scott www.com.zip, that says a
lot about our relationship with our children nowadays. Weanies, Johnny,
Richard, Dick etc.'</P>
<P>This movie is every bit as silly and crazy as the first. There are
moments that will make your sick, which are probably best forgotten, but
overall Mike Myers has redefined what it means to be an international
spy and leading man.</P>
