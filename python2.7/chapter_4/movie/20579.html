<PRE>                               THE MUSE
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A screenwriter who has lost his edge
          meets a real muse, a spirit said to inspire
          artists.  The price of the muse's services is to be
          constantly pampered in some of the most exquisite
          ways possible.  Albert Brooks once had a great ear
          for how people talk and a great eye for how they
          behave, but he himself may be losing his edge.  In
          spite of a few very clever moments this is far from
          Brooks's best or his most perceptive comedy.
          Rating: 5 (0 to 10), low +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     In his new film Albert Brooks plays a screenwriter who can still
write funny material but is losing his "edge."  He does not know what
it means to be losing his edge, but he is losing it nonetheless.
Sadly, the script of THE MUSE itself is often very funny, but Brooks
seems to be losing his own edge.  The Albert Brooks edge was to be able
to write dialog that is both funny and true.  In LOST IN AMERICA when
his wife gambles away "the nest egg," part of the punishment that
Brooks thinks of on the spur of the moment is she is no longer allowed
to use the words "nest" or "egg."  She must order fried THINGS for
breakfast.  If she sees a bird's home she must call it a round STICK.
This is very funny material because it is so ridiculous and at the same
time so possible.  But that very real sort of humor is missing from THE
MUSE.  In this film that kind of dialog is lost in all the sarcasm.</P>
<P>     Stephen Phillips (Albert Brooks) is a Hollywood screenwriter who
may be just getting to be past his prime.  When his latest script is
rejected he starts worrying about how to feed his family.  He goes to
his friend, the fabulously successful screenwriter Jack Warrick (Jeff
Bridges).  But who is this beautiful woman kissing Jack good-bye?  It
isn't his wife.  This is a side of Jack that Stephen has not seen
before.  Eventually Jack admits reluctantly that this woman is not his
mistress but really his muse.  Literally she is a muse.  She is one of
the nine daughters of Zeus.  If you treat her like a queen she will
inspire you to your most creative ideas and your best work.  Stephen
decides that he has nothing to lose and decides to make her his muse.
Her name is Sarah.</P>
<P>     Stephen starts seeing the Sarah (Sharon Stone) and taking up the
responsibility of keeping her happy.  Things that appeal to her tastes
do not come cheaply.  It costs tens of thousands of dollars a week to
keep her in the style to which she expects to live.  But she apparently
is the real thing and Stephen starts getting story ideas that may all
be worth the effort of keeping the pampered, spoiled, conscienceless
brat happy at all hours of the night with expensive snacks.  He will
indulge her even if it wrecks his marriage.  And it nearly does as his
wife Laura (Andie MacDowell) foolishly jumps to the conclusion her
husband is having an affair and then (surprise!) she very cleverly
realizes that explanation does not explain the strange behavior.  Again
the film parallel its own story when Stephen complains that his new
screenplay is lacking a third act and then he chooses one that seems
tacked on.  The ending is clearly the weakest part of the film.  Brooks
ties things up, but not in at all a satisfying way.</P>
<P>     Sharon Stone clearly is enjoying herself behaving pampered and
spoiled the way most people secretly would like to be.  Brooks is his
usual irritable character, but he has played this character too often
before.  He has also arranged an impressive lineup of familiar film
personalities to flesh out his story.</P>
<P>     What is unfortunate about THE MUSE is that Brooks walked right by
the best use of his concept and he never even noticed it.  The real
story is not the Muse's relationship with Stephen Phillips.  The story
to tell is how does a Muse establish herself in a cynical town like
Hollywood.  How does she make her first conquests?  How is her
reputation established?  This may be a story more in the realm of
Thorne Smith, but it is certainly where the interesting ideas are.  THE
MUSE is rated PG-13 for language and a moment of totally pointless
gratuitous nudity that apparently is present only to avoid a PG rating.
Speaking of rating, I give THE MUSE a 5 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low
+1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
