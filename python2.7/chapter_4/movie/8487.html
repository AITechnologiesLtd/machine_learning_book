Rating: ****</P>
<P>Yeah, I like the cast too. Coppola's 1972 epic masterpiece was back in
theaters for a short time earlier this year, and I hope all of you caught
it. On the tv screen The Godfather is simply a masterpiece. On the big
screen it is an indespensable experience. </P>
<P>The film opens at a somewhat slow pace. The paramount logo is presented
agaunst a lusterless background. Then the screen goes black. The words
appear: Mario Puzo's The Godfather. We hear Nina Rota's haunting theme and
then we are staring into the face of Bona Sera. He is on the verge of great
emotion. through oncoming sobs he says the films famous first line: "I
believe in America". 
Over the next two hours we learn to understand why. To the film's
character's America is not a place, it represents a certain ideal. The film
is about many things, but mostly it is about love and trust. It is about
how one family passes on a legacy. In The Godfather, nothing is more
important then honor. </P>
<P>Marlon Brando's performance is justly famous. His use of props like the
kitten show that he is a supremely confident actor. the character he
creates is a man who, although immoral and unjust, is understandable; that
is the film's secret; although everyone the film watches with morbid
fascination is a rat, we identify with them somehow. By the time Don
Corleone dies  in his garden he has became such a real person that we
almost feel upset; this is someone we have known. </P>
<P>Al Pacino had the performance of his career as Michael Corleone, the
reluctant heir to his father's position. Everything he does is so real; we
almost think that Pacino can't be acting. He suggests a young Brando in
many ways; I don't know if this is the effect they worked for, but they
certainly got it. </P>
<P>In the last shot of the film he has became the next don. He straight out
lies to his wife Kay ( Diane Keaton ) and arrogantly holds out his hand to
be kissed. The door swings shut on Kay and for the last time we hear Rota's
mournful score. Michael didn't have to be who he chose to be. He had
choices but, in the end, there was no other way it could have worked.
Nobody knew that better then The Godfather.</P>
<P>The Godfather runs 2:31. This length would have been far too long for a
normal film, but The Godfather is no normal film. It is truly one of the
greatest films ever made. I saw it with my good friend and movie lover
Micah on a big screen and we were both stunned. On a big screen ( where you
should make an effor to see it ) there is no intermission and, to the
film's eternal credit, you won't even want one. It's a goregous and
haunting movie. It is rated R for semi-nudity,  graphic but, for the most
part, not too disturbing violence, cursing, and adult situations. It is
appropriate for mature 11-12 year olds and up.  See it. Again.</P>
