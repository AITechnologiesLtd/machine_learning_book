<PRE>                                 DECEPTION
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>     Are you thinking about getting a camcorder ?  Do you already own a
camcorder?  If you answered yes to either of these questions, then you
MUST see DECEPTION.  You will pay for the price of the admission many
times over in just a single year by avoiding wasting tons of video
tape.</P>
<P>     The cinematography (Laszlo Kovacs) in DECEPTION contains in just
over an hour and a half ALL possible bad camera techniques.  By the
sixth time you watch the underbelly of a jet roaring overhead or a
close-up of silverware shaking in the sink as a jet flies by, you will
be busy taking mental notes of what to avoid.  You also get lots and
lots of pans - many of them blurry to keep your viewers curiosity
going.  You will find how you can make your audience laugh during
serious shots like the climbing a gigantic pyramid at dawn by using
silly camera angles.</P>
<P>     Oh yes, the movie itself?  It is a mess.  You say you want to know
the plot.  Well, this much I will tell you.  A recent widower (Andie
MacDowell) races around the globe trying to find who is taking the
money out of all of the banks where her husband stashed money that she
did not know he had in the first place.  If you like Andie MacDowell
like I do, then you do get to see her in almost every scene.  If you
like the costar, Liam Neeson, forget it, he hardly ever appears.</P>
<P>     DECEPTION's silly plot is unimportant to you, of course, since you
are seeing this film in order to save on tape purchases.  Truth be
told, the plot is so crazy and so full of holes that it keeps your
attention in a strange sort of way.  It is so bad, it is fascinating.</P>
<P>     DECEPTION (also known as RUBY CAIRO) runs a mercifully short 1:30.
It is rated PG-13 for some violence and bad language, but on the whole
it is a pretty tame show.  I give it a very generous * for somehow
keeping my attention by being so ridiculous I kept wondering what would
happen next.  Non-camcorder owners should avoid this show.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
