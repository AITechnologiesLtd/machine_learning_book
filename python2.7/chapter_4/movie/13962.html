The Proposition (Reviewed on August 4th/98)</PRE>
<P>Starring Kenneth Branagh, Madeline Stowe, William Hurt, Neil Patrick
Harris </P>
<P>1998 has not been a very good year for Kenneth Branagh.  First he starred
in Robert Altman's pretentious mess, "The Gingerbread Man".  And now he's
in "The Proposition", a well-acted but dull period piece.</P>
<P>The film tells the story of a very rich man (Hurt) who wishes to have a
baby with his wife (Stowe), but is sterile, thus creating a bit of a snag
in his plan.  He decides to hire a surrogate (Harris) of sorts to father
his child, but complications arise when the surrogate becomes emotionally
attached to the wife of said rich man.</P>
<P>Where does Branagh fit into this convoluted scheme, you ask?  Well, he
portrays a priest who is new to the local parish, and who also has a shady
past.  It really doesn't matter, anyway.  By the time all the secrets are
revealed, the viewer has lost interest long ago.</P>
<P>"The Proposition" is a film that can't seem to decide what genre it wants
to fit into.  It's starts off as a run-of-the-mill period piece, but after
about 30 minutes, it begins jumping wildly from one type of film to
another.  In certain cases, this can work (see "Pulp Fiction" for such an
example), but here it just comes of as an unpolished mess.  And, worse of
all, the movie can't even finish what it starts.  It opens with Branagh's
character telling someone the story of what really happened to these four
people, so the film is a flashback.  By the end of the film, one would
expect that the movie would come out of the flashback and into the
present.  This doesn't even happen!  "The Proposition" has gotten totally
wrapped up in it's multpile forays into different genres, that it
completely disregards what has occured at the beginning of the film.</P>
<P>The acting, on the other hand, is quite good.  William Hurt, an actor who
has become quite complacent in his own smugness as of late, breaks out of
that mold with an exciting portrayal of a man who has all the money in the
world, but, in the end, finds that it is completely useless.  And Doogie
Howser himself, Neil Patrick Harris plays a character who is a polar
opposite of that famous TV doc.  Madeline Stowe rounds out the cast as the
woman who is caught in the middle of all three of these men, and she is
very convincing in her self-doubt and constant confusion.</P>
<P>Which brings us back to Branagh, a usually brilliant actor.  Here, as in
"The Gingerbread Man", he seems to be wandering aimlessly throughout his
settings.  There's no spark or energy to his performance; he merely seems
to be cashing in a paycheque.  Let's hope he works himself out of this rut
soon.  It would be a genuine shame if he spent the rest of his career
making unfocused garbage like "The Proposition".</P>
