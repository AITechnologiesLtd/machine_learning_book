<PRE>                                TITANIC
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: "Titanic" is indeed the word for the
          huge film TITANIC. While it has been filmed several
          times, this will be the version people will
          remember first for years to come.  Still, a
          melodramatic love triangle with a villainous jilted
          fiance firing off guns on the sinking ship is just
          not what the story of the ill-fated ship needed.
          The film could have had more historic detail, less
          fiction, and could have been even more enjoyable.
          But Titanic's warning that no technology is totally
          safe from failure is more timely today than it was
          in 1912 at the time of the sinking.  Rating: 6 (0
          to 10), high +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     There are really two approaches to making a film about the sinking
of the Titanic, and both were tried in the 1950s.  The 1953 film
TITANIC had passenger Clifton Webb reacting to discovering that his son
was illegitimate.  Impending death as the ship sinks changes his
attitude for the better.  On the other hand, the 1958 film A NIGHT TO
REMEMBER is a dramatization of passengers' accounts of the sinking of
the great ship.  They had some false ideas about the sinking, but for
the most part they were trying to accurately portray events that
happened that night.  The 1953 TITANIC is a pleasant old film and fun
to watch; A NIGHT TO REMEMBER is a cinema classic.  As one might
imagine, there were a large number of very dramatic stories going on at
the same time when the Titanic sank.  It just is not necessary to
invent a fictional story to take place at the same time, and it is an
irritating distraction from what most of the audience considers the
real story they paid to see.  The 1997 TITANIC, written and directed by
James Cameron, is about a very one-sided love triangle set on the
Titanic.  At 194 minutes, the film also has time for some detail about
the sinking including some that has never been filmed before.  But
overall it has less historic detail than the much shorter and lower-
budgeted A NIGHT TO REMEMBER.  That is in part because James Cameron
takes almost two hours of screen time to get the Titanic to the iceberg
and even after it does hit, he still cannot bring himself to believe
that the audience is more interested in the sinking ship than in his
banal love story.</P>
<P>     Visually, the 1997 TITANIC is by far the best version, but for
historical detail, I think the real enthusiasts about the sinking will
probably prefer the 1958 telling.  Cameron seems to accept this by
borrowing many scenes almost intact.  Some of these may be from
historic accounts, but the similarities go beyond the content of the
borrowed scenes.  The incidents are simply re-filmed using the same
style.</P>
<P>     The film begins with some intrepid young explorers, led by Brock
Lovett (played by Bill Paxton dragging along memories of his too
similar role in TWISTER), exploring the recently found sunken hull of
the RMS Titanic and in particular looking for a (fictional) diamond
that supposedly went down with the great ship. They do not find the
diamond itself, but they do find a drawing of a nude woman wearing the
diamond. When the drawing is shown on television, a woman calls the
team to say that not only can she identify the picture, she is the
woman.  (Hey, would you believe the elderly woman is Gloria Stuart, who
played opposite Melvyn Douglas and Boris Karloff in OLD DARK HOUSE and
opposite Claude Rains in THE INVISIBLE MAN?)</P>
<P>     As the old woman tells the explorers her story, we drift back to
the sailing of the Titanic.  Rose DeWitt Buketer (Kate Winslet) is from
a family of old money and new debt.  Her mother has arranged a marriage
between her and Cal Hockley (Billy Zane, played as quite possibly the
most obnoxious American man then alive).  This part is extremely over-
written, with Hockley making judgments that Pablo Picasso will never
amount to anything in the art world and that lifeboats are a waste of
space on the unsinkable Titanic. Having to watch him on the screen for
a few hours is painful; a lifetime with him would have to be worse than
death.  At least that is what Rose decides and is ready to cast herself
into the cold ocean when Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), a young
artist from the lower classes and the lower decks, steps forward and
convinces her to live.  Of course he is everything that Cal is not,
including poor, unfortunately.  But of course the two fall madly in
love.  And of course the angry and spoiled Cal plots revenge.  Even
after the Titanic strikes an iceberg--sorry, was that supposed to have
a spoiler warning?--the film still concerns itself too much with this
love triangle and not enough with the sinking ship.  Earlier we have
seen parts of the ship behaving perfectly.  We should revisit the
engine room and its machinery with grasshopper-like legs kicking fly-
wheels and see what flooding is doing to it.  One wants to return to
the radio room and see what is happening there as the operator
desperately tries to find help.  Instead we follow a fictional Cal
hatching nefarious plots at Jack's expense.  It is class warfare at its
most obvious.  This is one time when truth would be a lot more
interesting than fiction.</P>
<P>     Frightfully underutilized is Kathy Bates as the unsinkable and
likably straightforward Molly Brown.  Also misused is David Warner as
Cal's one-dimensional thug and bodyguard.  And why bother casting Eric
Braeden/Hans Gudegast as John Jacob Astor if you do not intend to use
him?</P>
<P>     What we do see of the ship's problems, and in so long a film that
is still quite a bit, is enough to make this the most visually
impressive rendition of the sinking, at least in other ways.  We might
expect that from a film produced by both Paramount and Fox, costing
$200,000,000--making it the most expensive American film ever, perhaps
beaten only by the Russian version of WAR AND PEACE.  (The original
ship itself cost about $7,500,000, incidentally.)  Camera shots flying
us the length of the ship are jaw-droppers even if they do have the
feel of digital images.  Seeing dramatized the contortions of the ship
as it breaks up is new to cinema and pretty scary.</P>
<P>     TITANIC does make the mistake that every version of the sinking
makes, something that could be called "angular continuity."  Until it
breaks up at the very end, the Titanic was a rigid ship.  This means
that if one stateroom is tipped at a 27-degree angle, at the same
instant of time every room, every deck, every walkway is also tipped at
a 27-degree angle.  During the sinking every scene should show a room
tipped at just a bit more of an angle than the previous scene.  No film
version has ever paid close enough attention to angular continuity.  It
means, for one thing, that before shooting one has to know exactly the
order of the shots and that order cannot be rearranged in the editing
(well, perhaps only minimally).  The angle of tipping varies wildly
from scene to scene.  A room will be shown tipped at a high angle, but
in the next scene dishes will fall off shelves that should have fallen
considerably earlier.</P>
<P>     TITANIC is a lot of movie for the same priced ticket as anything
else at the multiplex.  This is a big film with a lot to like as well
as a lot to not.  For this budget and with digital technology the story
could have been told with supreme accuracy and been a much more
compelling film at the same time.  Overall I give it a 6 on the 0 to 10
scale and a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
