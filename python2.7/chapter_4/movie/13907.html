<PRE>Snake Eyes 
Grade: C+ 
1998, 99 minutes, MPAA rated R 
Director: Brian De Palma </PRE>
<P>Cinema's biggest show-off has a grand time in Snake Eyes, a fairly
straightforward (and largely uninspired) political-thriller plot
enlivened (and cheapened) by its director's need to impress film
students the world over. </P>
<P>Brian De Palma, whose work I generally abhor, takes a standard story
and pumps it up with a perspective-shifting treatment, only to hurt
the work by not knowing when to stop his gimmicks and, finally, not
having enough material to sustain the movie. </P>
<P>At a high-profile fight in Atlantic City, the Secretary of Defense is
assassinated not three feet from corrupt cop Rick Santoro (Nicolas
Cage), who dives into the case blindly, not realizing how fully it
will entrap him. </P>
<P>The single, extraordinary shot that sets up the film, running at least
ten minutes, descends into beautifully orchestrated chaos as the
camera follows Santoro through the arena, placing bets, shaking down
drug dealers, talking on his gold cell phone, and watching the main
event, ending with gunfire just after his fighter goes down. What sets</P>
<P>Santoro off is the boxer's reaction. He's just been knocked out, but
when shots ring out, his eyes snap open. Santoro thinks the hulk threw
the fight and approaches him. </P>
<P>The boxer's narrative (shown literally through his eyes, a technique
that is fun, interesting, confusing, and irritating all at the same
time) sets the cop on the trail of his best  friend, Major Kevin Dunne
(Gary Sinise), who set up security for the bout. The case actually
involves little police work, though, as the boxer and a mysterious
woman (Carla Gugino) tell Santoro all he needs to know, and security
cameras back up their stories. The simplicity of the case affords De
Palma the opportunity to show the same ten minutes that opened the
movie from several characters' perspectives. Those sequences have a
nice kick to them, and make it easy to forget how pedestrian the 
story is. </P>
<P>But De Palma achieves a strange goal of film direction here, in which
the means are not nearly as important as the end. The images of Snake
Eyes are themselves not terribly exciting or interesting. The artistry
comes from the pains the director took to capture them, and only
people who love the craft of making movies will properly 
appreciate the work involved. </P>
<P>In its last half hour, too, the movie settles into a bland drama, with
Santoro and Dunne facing off. It seems that once De Palma has
dispensed with his tricks, he simply wants to tie up the plot and
theme loose ends. Will Santoro turn in his best friend? Or will he
take the money and turn his head, the way he always has? </P>
<P>In another movie, these questions might have generated some interest.
But with all the style of Snake Eyes' first hour, the end is
disappointing and dull.</P>
