<PRE>"Road Trip" - Let's Go!
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>"Road Trip," a tale about four underachieving college
students who embark on a hastily planned journey, is a
4-lane highway of laughter and is one of the funniest
movies in recent memory.  Convince your friend to
drive you, steal a bus from a school for the blind, or
walk through the backwoods as fast as you can. 
Whatever mode of transportation you choose, make your
final destination this hilarious new comedy.  </P>
<P>The tone is effectively set up within the first five
minutes of the film as we join up with Barry (Tom
Green), a career Senior at Ithaca University, who is
in the midst of giving a tour to a group of
prospective incoming freshman.  Barry is a bag of
mixed emotions composed of 3 parts lethargy and 1 part
morbid curiosity.  During the tour, he rambles about
Ithaca's history and points out, for example, that its
library was built in the 1600s.  A flustered tour
participant points to an ornamental plaque by the
library's entrance and retorts that the building was
actually built in 1951.  "No," he says after some
self-deliberation.  "That's the address."</P>
<P>As part of the tour, he relays the story of
long-distance couple Josh (Breckin Meyer) and Tiffany
(Rachel Blanchard).   He attends Ithaca while she
attends a university in Austin ("That's in
Massachusetts," says the likable but dimwitted Barry).</P>
<P>Josh worries about the pact that they made to stay
close.  To show his commitment, he prepares a
videotaped message professing his undying love.  His
sexually adventurous friend, E.L. (Sean William Scott)
tries to explain to him that holding out for a
long-distance love could be the greatest folly of his
life.  He imparts, "the window of opportunity to
drink, do drugs and get with girls is getting smaller
with each passing day.  Before you know it, you'll be
40 and you'll have to pay for these kinds of girls."</P>
<P>Josh is unfazed, but after a wild party hosted by
E.L., he winds up with college hottie Beth (Amy Smart)
and subsequently videotapes his act of infidelity. 
Guess which videotape gets mistakenly sent to
girlfriend Beth?  Aghast, Josh has only a matter of
days to travel to Austin to intercept the tape and
then to get back in order to take a critical final
test.  In a matter of days, he could lose his
girlfriend AND get expelled from school.</P>
<P>E.L. exuberantly yells, "all right, road trip!"  Along
for the ride is levelheaded, pot smoking Rubin(Paulo
Costanzo) and the meek and thin-as-a-pin Kyle (DJ
Qualls) who is invited because he's the only one with
a car and a credit card.  Without giving notice, the
four hurriedly leave.  This infuriates Beth who,
thanks to Barry's command of American geography,
boards a bus to the University of Massachusetts to
find Josh.  Barry, meanwhile, uses their absence to
fulfill his dream of feeding Rubin's pet boa
constrictor.  And Kyle's ill-tempered father (Fred
Ward), who could easily make the National Rifle
Association jittery, thinks that his son has been
kidnapped.  Meanwhile, the four Austin-bound students
experience their own share of setbacks and bizarre
encounters.  In its funniest segment, the group tries
to pass themselves off as brothers of an all-black
fraternity.  A great road trip isn't about where you
wind up, but what happens on the way there.  These
guys will experience the trip of their lives.</P>
<P>"Road Trip" is this summer's most refreshing
alternative.  But it will appeal most to the under 35
crowd.  It's a crisp, straightforward comedy.  It's
not ribald (i.e. "There's Something About Mary") nor
is it a lampoon ("Naked Gun").  It's more like
'guerilla comedy' where the jokes just seem to come
out of nowhere and then latch onto you until you
laugh.  The humor is relentless, the pace is lively,
and you'll come out of it grinning from ear to ear.</P>
