<PRE>"Chicken Run" -- Poultry in Motion
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>"Chicken Run," a fanciful tale about chickens
desperate to escape captivity, is innovative and
clever and is one of the most unique looking films
this year.  On the Tweedy Chicken Farm, life is cruel
and laborious.  These chickens live in a setting
that's reminiscent of a World War II concentration
camp.  The ground is muddied, the area is encircled by
barbed wire, and the perimeter is constantly patrolled
by Mr. Tweedy (voiced by Tony Haygarth) and his two
snarling guard dogs.  Worse, the bitter Mrs. Tweedy
(voiced by Miranda Richardson) oversees the farm.  She
closely examines her production report every week. 
And, if a chicken doesn't lay enough eggs, she takes
the underachiever to the chopping block.  </P>
<P>Ginger (voiced by Julia Sawalha), the plucky leader,
knows that they'll all meet the same fate sooner or
later.  She moons about freedom and the feeling of
lush grass under her three-toed feet.  She presses
everyone to think about escape.  But all attempts,
which include using a spoon to dig under a fence and
using an eggbeater to drill a tunnel, meet with
failure.  Of course, she could probably escape on her
own.  But the trick is to rescue the entire lot. 
That's no small feat, but these concepts of
selflessness, charity and teamwork are the
underpinnings that make this a heartwarming film.</P>
<P>Ginger's prayers may be answered when Rocky Rooster
(voiced by Mel Gibson) lands in the chicken farm.  She
marvels at his ability to 'fly' and believes that
flight offers the best chance of escape.  She hopes
that he'll teach them but finds it difficult to
establish a working relationship with the cocky
rooster.  He seems more interested in socializing and
boasting and is reluctant to help.  However, after
considerable duress, Rocky agrees to Ginger's request.</P>
<P>The ensuing sequences are hilarious as the chickens
engage in calisthenics, practice martial arts, and
attempt to fly by leaping off rooftops.  But lack of
progress begins to arouse the suspicion of some
others.  Ginger, however, clings on to hope.  "The
chances of us escaping are a million to one," says one
of the demoralized flock.  "Then we still have a
chance," says our optimistic heroine.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, their activities have caught the attention
of Mr. Tweedy.  "The chickens are organizing," he
urges the Missus, to which she replies, "chickens
can't organize."  But, she does notice that egg
production is dropping.  Tired of minuscule profits,
she decides to enter a different business that is even
more threatening to the livelihoods of the chicken
population.  Now, it's a race for survival.  If Ginger
and her flock can not escape in time, they may all
wind up in the frozen food section of the local
supermarket.</P>
<P>"Chicken Run," with its humorous level of mayhem, is a
fun movie for children.  However, it would have been
more appealing if the colors/palettes used weren't so
bleak.  Yet this is a film about a chicken
pen-itentiary, so its hues are understandably grayish.
 Adults will also find the plot engaging and even
dramatic.  And if you're familiar with the creator's
popular "Wallace and Gromit" mini-films, you'll find
many of its charming quirks here, including the heavy
Yorkshire accents, and the lipless faces with mouths
that have more bottom teeth than top ones.</P>
<P>Of greatest note is the amount of work needed to
create this film.  It uses Stop-motion photography in
which the models are minutely reshaped and
repositioned from shot to shot to give the illusion of
3-D movement.  To create one second of film, 24 shots
are required.  Anything less would result in
Gumby-esque choppiness.  Some of the scenes are
wonderfully and incredibly complex, including the
morning roll call; a dance party; and the clever
finale.  "Chicken Run" is fun to watch and amazing to
look at.  It's not as rousing a tale or as colorful as
Toy Story 2, but it's certainly as inventive and as
sweet.</P>
