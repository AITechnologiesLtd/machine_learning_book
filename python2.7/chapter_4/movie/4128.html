<PRE>                               GET SHORTY
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     The cryptic title of GET SHORTY should forewarn you of the confusion
to come when the film actually starts.  To be honest, I *still* don't
really know what it's supposed to mean.  Initially, I was pretty excited
about the prospects for GET SHORTY:  it's John Travolta's much-anticipated
follow-up to PULP FICTION; great actors Gene Hackman and Rene Russo both
star; the well-regarded Elmore Leonard penned the novel that the movie is
based on.  What a disappointment!</P>
<P>     The story goes:  Travolta is Chili Palmer, a small time Miami hood, a
"shylock" whose job is essentially coercing money out of people.  His boss
sends Chili on a chase for some questionably-raised funds; in Vegas,
another contact sends him to L.A. to track down an entirely unrelated
debtor, Harry Zimm (Hackman).  And there are a few drug dealers who have
their payoff stuck in a locker at LAX.</P>
<P>     With all this money lying around, someone has the bright idea to
produce a movie.  Actually, *everyone* has the bright idea to produce a
movie--Chili, Zimm, Zimm's leading lady (Russo), the drug dealers, you
name it.  Somehow Danny DeVito gets wrapped up in all this, and of course,
it's nothing but wacky hijinks until we get to the tidy ending!</P>
<P>     While it's fun to watch Chili get caught up in the Hollywood scene
and continually pitch this oddly familiar movie (it's a movie about a
shylock's trip to L.A. to track down some absconded cash), it's not so
much fun to watch 80 different plotlines convolute around what should have
been, at its heart, an innovative and simple story.  The sheer volume of
information presented in GET SHORTY is just way too much to absorb in 2
hours, and it results in a talky, sanitized, often boring, tragicomedy
that begins to fade from memory as soon as you leave the theater.</P>
<P>     There are a few plusses to GET SHORTY.  The direction is good and the
acting is solid for the most part, and while I genuinely like Travolta,
he's beginning to become a caricature of himself, a la Jim Carrey.  Will
Vinnie Barbarino ever die?  By the looks of it, certainly not anytime
soon.</P>
