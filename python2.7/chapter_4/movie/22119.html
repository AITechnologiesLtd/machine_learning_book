<P>Expectations have been running so high for Frank Darabont's adaptation of the 
Stephen King serial novel, "The Green Mile," that many film industrialites 
prematurely labeled it "The Best Film of 1999," even before it was finished 
filming. 'Premature' is the correct adjective because, while "The Green Mile" 
is a very fine, intimately made drama on its own, it does not come close to 
standing up to its lofty presumptions. This is not a criticism of the film 
itself, but simply a negative observation about how hype is more often than 
not highly unnecessary, and ends up doing more damage than good.</P>
<P>Aside from the 3-hour-plus running time, "The Green Mile" occasionally bears 
a slight resemblance to 1997's "Titanic," particularly in the wraparound 
story in which we meet a very old man named Paul Edgecomb (Dabbs Greer), who 
lives at a nursing home and breaks down crying one afternoon when he happens 
to see Fred Astaire singing "Cheek to Cheek" in an old movie. When confidante 
Elaine (a fabulous Eve Brent) shows her concern and goes to see what is the 
matter, Paul decides to tell her a story that took place sixty years before, 
and that he has never discussed until now.</P>
<P>Switch back to the year of 1935 in Louisiana, a much-younger Paul (Tom Hanks) 
works as a prison guard at the Cold Mountain Penitentiary, where the 
convicted criminals on death row are sent. Currently suffering a painful 
bladder infection, but with a lovely, supportive wife (Bonnie Hunt), Paul's 
whole perspective on life gradually changes with the appearance of John 
Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a 7-foot-tall, 350-LB. black man who has been 
convicted of raping and murdering two young girls. Like a giant kid himself, 
John instantly does not seem like the type who would hurt a fly, as he even 
requests that the lights stay on at night, "'cuz I'm scared of the dark."</P>
<P>Other inmates are met and also focused on, including Arlen Bitterbuck (Graham 
Greene), a highly spiritual Native American; William "Wild Bill" Wharton (Sam 
Rockwell), a psychopath as crazy as a crap-house rat; and Eduard "Del" 
Delacroix (Michael Jeter), a kindhearted man who befriends Mr. Jingles, a 
mouse that roams The Green Mile, called that because the floors are painted 
green as they lead the inmates to their executions. Complicating matters is 
the arrival of a new, young prison guard hotshot named Percy (Doug 
Hutchison), a truly despicable human being who gets his kicks out of 
humiliating and deliberately hurting others. As time passes, we watch as some 
of the inmates are taken to their deaths, people that we have grown to care 
about, and all the while Paul grows a close friendship with John Coffey, who, 
through supernatural plot developments that will not be divulged here, he 
becomes convinced is innocent of the crimes which will inevitably send him to 
his wrongful execution.</P>
<P>Frank Darabont, whose previous film was the similar Stephen King-adapted "The 
Shawshank Redemption," has returned back to the setting of a prison for the 
second time in a row, and it cannot be denied that he has a definite flare 
for this sort of storyline. While "The Shawshank Redemption" was that rare 
case in which it bombed in movie theaters, but gained an overwhelmingly 
positive following on video, I was not one of its strongest supporters. At 
close to 2 1/2 hours, the picture was an effective, but severely flawed drama 
that had (to me) several long, dry stretches in the middle that could have 
easily been cut out. In comparison, "The Green Mile" is over 3 hours in 
length, but never once overstays its welcome, nor does it even feel like a 
movie of such great length. This is because, while deliberately paced, it 
also has been tightly edited by Richard Francis-Bruce, with not one scene 
that should have been thrown on the cutting room floor; every second of 
screen time has a clear purpose, even when the developments themselves begin 
to grow strained by the finale.</P>
<P>One of the most powerful attributes of the film is its depiction of time 
passing within the penitentiary, as certain intimately drawn characters come 
and go through death row, just to end up as nothing more than memories within 
the walls of the building. This subject matter is superbly handled under the 
helming of writer-director Darabont, as are the occasional sequences of 
execution by electric chair. Credit must go to Darabont again for not turning 
his back on these harsh moments, as he graphically depicts the death scenes, 
which are tough to take not only for what they shows, but also because the 
victims are people we have grown to like and respect, whether they are guilty 
or not of their convicted crimes. One particular execution sequence is just 
about as stirring and devastatingly inhumane as anything I have ever seen on 
film before.</P>
<P>The ensemble cast of "The Green Mile" is first-rate across the board, 
headlined by star Tom Hanks, whose exact, naturalistic turn as Paul Edgecomb 
could very well be his most impressive since 1993's "Philadelphia" or 1994's 
"Forrest Gump." A perfect balance of personalities and casting, newcomer 
Michael Clarke Duncan is genuinely effective as the magical, honest John 
Coffey, all the more striking because it is his feature film debut. </P>
<P>Supporting players all make an impression, no one more so than Michael Jeter, 
who is outstanding as inmate Del, a terminally lonely but giving person who 
finds joy in his life through the sort of loyal partnership he forms with Mr. 
Jingles. Heartbreaking and not easy to forget, Jeter gives one of the 
strongest supporting performances of the year. As cruel and heartless as a 
movie character can be without heading in cartoonish territory is Doug 
Hutchison, as Percy, a man without one redeeming quality who strives on the 
pain he causes others. While never rising above two dimensions, Hutchison 
still makes quite an impact. Sam Rockwell, a chameleon who has proven in 
recent years to be able to play a wide spectrum of characters (1997's "Box of 
Moonlight," 1998's "Lawn Dogs"), is downright creepy as William Wharton, a 
maniac that John Coffey senses is downright evil. The underrated Bonnie Hunt 
also turns in fine work as Paul's wife, despite not having much to do. </P>
<P>While thoroughly effective and well-made, one major misstep the film takes is 
in its final fifteen minutes which, at first, abruptly switches gears into 
more mainstream territory, complete with a climactic scene that feels overly 
calculated and tough to swallow. This moment is so disappointing because it 
is purposefully treated to be a scene that gets audiences to cry, rather than 
one that is more truthful to the situation. Accordingly, when the wraparound 
story comes back into play in the end, the film takes another turn for the 
worst. Instead of being merely downbeat, the conclusion is inappropriately 
depressing and uncalled-for, and left me feeling more revolted than 
emotionally satisfied. [Side note: Riding home with my brother afterwards, we 
got into a brief argument spurred from me making a sarcastic comment at him, 
because the movie had put me in a very bad mood]. </P>
<P>The ending may have come as a major letdown, but that, ultimately, cannot 
take away from the first 165 minutes of "The Green Mile," which are 
consistently engrossing and perceptive. Darabont is a master of writing and 
populating his films with memorable, solid supporting characters, and he has 
struck gold with his cast this time around. It's just too bad, then, that the 
finale could not have been stronger. It downgrades a potentially great film 
to being, at most, a very good one.</P>
