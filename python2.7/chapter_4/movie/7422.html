<PRE>                           FROM DUSK TILL DAWN
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>>From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) ****1/2 out of ***** - Cast: Harvey Keitel,
George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, Juliette Lewis, Fred Williamson, Cheech
Marin, Salma Hayek, Michael Parks, John Saxon, Kelly Preston, Tom Savini.
Written by Quentin Tarantino. Directed by: Robert Rodriguez. Running Time:
110 minutes.</P>
<P>Screenwriter/co-star Tarantino and director Robert Rodriguez instantly
rebound from the overall pathetic "Four Rooms" to bring us an extremely
entertaining horror film. This is exactly what movies should be, fun from
start to finish.</P>
<P>Clooney and Tarantino are the Gecko brothers, who happen to be bank robbers
and murderers. They head down to Mexico after a heist and along the way
kidnap Keitel and his kids. They end up in a bar in Mexico which just so
happens to be populated by vampires and from there, Evil Dead/Dawn of the
Dead-ish mayhem begins. The film opens with one of the coolest scenes in
recent years and stays constant throughout. The character Michael Parks
plays in that opening scene is so interesting, you'll wish he was in the
film more. Great dialog, fun action sequences, and excellent acting from a
great cast, including Tarantino, who is often taking hits on his acting
ability (sometimes justifiable hits). This is his best performance on film.
Williamson spoofs his characters from just about every movie he's ever been
in as the tough ex-Vietnam vet, and make-up artist Savini seems to be
playing the exact same character he portrayed in "Dawn of the Dead". [R]</P>
