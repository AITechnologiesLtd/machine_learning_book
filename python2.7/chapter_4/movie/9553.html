<P>Disco balls, big hair and bellbottoms -- it's the fashionably gory glory
days of the 1970s in Paul Thomas Anderson's sophomore feature "Boogie
Nights." The movie is already garnering raves and even early fall Oscar
buzz, but this critic was left with a slightly sour taste in his mouth.
By no means a poor film, or even an unsatisfactory one, "Boogie Nights"
manages to keep momentum spinning for over an hour before giving into
shaky ground in its final last half. Don't get me wrong -- there's much
rich material within its long running time of 150 minutes-plus, but it's
being dazzlingly overrated.</P>
<P>Mark Wahlberg (formerly of Marky Mark fame and a lead turn in the stinky
"Fear") plays the main character here, a 17-year-old San Fernando Valley
busboy named Eddie Adams. Following an escape from his relentlessly
tough home life, Eddie falls into the vortex of seemingly painless
pleasure that is the adult film industry in '77. His recruiter, porn
director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), is amazed by the kid's prowess
on-screen, his benevolence off-screen and his general contributions to
the business. Of course, his 13-inch endowment doesn't hurt, either.</P>
<P>The other characters that make up the extended family of entertainers
are as follows: Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), Jack's wife and the den
mother of their small clan; Rollergirl (Heather Graham), a hot starlet
who's willing to take off everything but her skates; Buck Swope (Don
Cheadle), a veteran performer who dreams of marriage, children and his
own electronics store; Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly), an actor who
quickly forms a bond with Eddie; and Little Bill (William H. Macy), a
technical worker who can never quite come to terms with the people and
situations around which he works.</P>
<P>Jack plans to redefine the genre by putting plot into porn -- giving
viewers reason to stay in their theater seats after they, uh, don't have
the motivation to. Eddie plays an integral part in this quest to make a
film that is "true and right and dramatic" -- he changes his name to the
highly suggestive Dirk Diggler and takes the starring role of a James
Bond-type hero with more of a focus on the women and sex than the
gadgets and foreign intrigue (sample title: "Brock Landers 7: Oral
Majesty"). But as Dirk, Jack, Amber and company make the transition into
the early 1980s, the pornography progresses from film to video and
their happy lives and sense of togetherness are threatened by ego,
violence, drugs and other extremes.</P>
<P>"Boogie Nights" tells a story that depends on its characters and for the
most part, it succeeds. Wahlberg, Reynolds, Moore and Reilly are all
fantastic creations: funny, flawed and full of life. Some members of the
supporting cast come across with colorful personalities even though they
aren't fully developed -- they're allowed to stay too much in the
background. You come away wishing you got to know Macy, Graham and
Cheadle better, because what you're given are interesting details that
don't amount to anything especially complete. All of the actors are
strong, including a performance by Reynolds that ranks among his best
work.</P>
<P>What restrains the movie from achieving a higher ground is a quite
jarring shift in tone, which takes place around the time that Little
Bill makes a disturbing resolution to the ongoing dilemma of constantly
finding his wife (actual porn star Nina Hartley) in compromising
positions with other men. From then on, "Boogie Nights" is less a satire
of the industry than a commentary on its evils, as these characters are
sucked down into a vortex of drugs, death and lascivious sex crimes. The
movie's final sequence is hopeful, but its sure-to-be-controversial last
frame is rather unnecessary.</P>
<P>Flaws aside, "Boogie Nights" is still a subversive, gutsy release from
New Line Cinema, a production company that usually specializes in ho-hum
genre pictures. It's a visual dynamo, a credit guaranteed from
Anderson's brilliant opening, a single-shot journey inside a disco club
that introduces us to most of the movie's main players. That the story
eventually spins out of control is forgivable, because the film is such
a technical marvel, accurate in its depiction of the 1970s from clothes
to hair to music (I still haven't stopped humming Three Dog Night's
"Mama Told Me Not to Come"). And even the movie's fumble of overlength
doesn't hinder it from being fully alive, because "Boogie Nights" is an
admirably enthusiastic jolt of cinematic caffeine -- you're never bored
with it.</P>
<P>When all said and done, "Boogie Nights" is an admirable picture, even if
its shortcomings (no pun intended) amount to more than expected. The
acting is distinguished, and the storytelling, for a long while, is
extremely well-crafted; there's just no reason to stretch everything out
to less than 30 minutes shy of three hours. In the end, "Boogie Nights"
is pretty similar to Dirk Diggler -- quite a sight but little more than
the sum of its parts, however nifty they might be.</P>
