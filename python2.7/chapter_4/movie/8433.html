<P>     187 (ONE EIGHT SEVEN), the new film from WATERWORLD director Kevin 
Reynolds, lies somewhere in the murky gray that separates the 
exploitation revenge flick from the serious urban drama.  Simply put, 
this film is too good to be lumped together with DEATH WISH, EYE FOR AN 
EYE, and THE SUBSTITUTE in the latter genre, but not good enough to 
share the shelf with BOYZ 'N THE HOOD and MENACE II SOCIETY.  187 offers 
some thought-provoking ideas and several effective performances, but the 
script ultimately lets down both the actors and the audience members who 
are watching them.</P>
<P>     Public education today isn't what it used to be.  Many urban 
schools have metal detectors, and the threat of violence, either by 
student on student or by student on teacher, hangs in the air.  
Newspaper headlines shout out stories of children gunned down in 
bathrooms or stabbed in halls or classrooms.  Discipline has become a 
joke; students and teachers alike are more concerned with surviving the 
school day than following a cirriculum.  So it's not much of a stretch 
to accept that the environment presented in 187 is closer to reality 
than to some nightmarish fantasy. </P>
<P>     "187" is the police code for a homicide.  It's also the terse 
message science that teacher Trevor Garfield (Samuel L. Jackson) finds 
scrawled in a textbook meant for his eyes only.  When Garfield goes to 
the principal of New York's Roosevelt Whitney High School to report what 
he believes to be a threat on his life, he is calmly informed that he's 
overreacting.  Moments later, Garfield has been stabbed ten times in the 
back by an irate pupil.</P>
<P>     Fifteen months later, Garfield is returning to teaching, but this 
time as a substitute, and no longer in New York City, but in Los 
Angeles.  John Quincy Adams High, however, bears a striking resemblance 
to Whitney.  Gangs and violence are pervasive, and a greater percentage 
of the students are at school to kill time rather than to learn.  
Garfield is tentative about returning to work, but he's an idealist who 
loves his vocation, so he accepts a four-day assignment for an absent 
science teacher.  Almost immediately, his disciplinarian stance makes 
him a target for the verbal abuse of some of the class' most tough 
trash-talkers.  He also learns that one of his fellow teachers, Dave 
Childress (John Heard), keeps a gun in his desk, and another, Ellen 
Henry (Kelly Rowan), has received death threats.</P>
<P>     For better than an hour, 187 treads the delicate line between the 
gratuitous violence of THE SUBSTITUTE and the schmaltz of DANGEROUS 
MINDS.  In fact, for more than the first half, this movie takes a frank, 
hard look at the difficulties facing teachers in urban environments 
today -- how helping a student can be misconstrued, how law suit-fearing 
administrators are rendered impotent, and how peer pressure can drive 
otherwise-studious teenagers out of the classroom and into gangs.  
Garfield is an idealist, and he's fighting a losing battle, but, because 
he believes in the cause of education, it's a war that he's willing to 
participate in.  And, for different reasons, he's an inspiration to both 
Dave and Ellen.</P>
<P>     Then, as seemingly must happen in films of this sort, Garfield goes 
too far, and someone wants to kill him.  The last forty-five minutes of 
187 play like a condensed, low-key version of FALLING DOWN.  And the 
conclusion, aside from being unremittingly bleak, is horribly written.  
The characters' motivations in the climactic scene make no sense 
whatsoever, and the viewer feels profoundly cheated by events.  </P>
<P>     A saving grace of 187 is the performance of Samuel L. Jackson, one 
of today's few "can't miss" actors.  No matter how uneven the script, 
Jackson always manages to shine, and, since he's on screen for almost 
every frame of this film, his forceful screen presence compensates for 
numerous weaknesses.  He's supported by a fine cast, including Heard and 
Rowan as fellow teachers, Clifton Gonzalez Gonzalez as his chief student 
nemesis, and Karina Arroyave as a young woman whom Garfield takes under 
his wing.</P>
<P>     Nevertheless, while Jackson's performance is enough to keep us 
engrossed for most of the running time, even he can't do much with the 
unfortunate resolution.  It's here that 187 comes apart at the seams -- 
the conclusion will disappoint those who love revenge fantasies and 
those in search for something more thoughtful.  Indeed, with a different 
ending, 187 might have been a truly powerful motion picture.  As it is, 
it has its compelling moments, but, overall, it's flawed and 
dissatisfying.</P>
