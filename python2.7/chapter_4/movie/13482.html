<PRE>Back Street (1941)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 71</PRE>
<P>"Back Street" is a high-quality tear jerker and
soap opera.  While the intended audience is women,
men should also be able to appreciate the sets,
cinematography, and performances.</P>
<P>Margaret Sullavan stars as a vivacious young
woman at the turn of the century, who has several
suitors, most notably automobile tinkerer Richard
Carlson.  She is not interested in losing her
freedom, however, until she meets ambitious banker
Charles Boyer.  Boyer and Sullavan have a brief,
potent romance, but wedding plans are dashed due
to a misunderstanding.</P>
<P>Years later, Boyer and Sullavan are re-united.
Boyer is now married and has a strong career.  They
have an affair over many years, but he is unwilling
to make sacrifices for Sullavan.  Sullivan bypasses
opportunies for her own happily married life.</P>
<P>The first half of "Back Street" is the best.  Sullavan
is brims with energy, and is optimistic and carefree.
As she becomes Boyer's kept woman, these qualities
disappear, and Boyer's character becomes less likeable.
Sullavan, Boyer and Carlson give excellent performances.
The sets are also very good.  As for film weaknesses,
some of the minor supporting characters aren't
credible, in particular an ever-complaining co-worker
of Sullavan's at the dress shop.</P>
<P>"Back Street" was originally a novel by Fanny Hurst.
This was the second of three Hollywood productions of
the novel, and is easily the best version.</P>
<P>Department of unhappy coincidences: both Boyer and
Sullavan would later die from barbiturate overdoses.</P>
