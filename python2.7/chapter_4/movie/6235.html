                            Thinner (1996)
                   A film review by Michael Redman
                    Copyright 1996 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>As I write this, it's a rainy night with severe wind gusts and only two
evenings away from Halloween: Stephen King atmosphere. It'd be
appropriate to talk about King's new film and how frightening it is.</P>
<P>Yeah, it'd be appropriate, but it ain't gonna happen.</P>
<P>Films from King supernatural horror tales haven't done so well in recent
years. There hasn't been a well-crafted one since....well, since before
some of you were born. King movies, a genre unto themselves, started out
with great promise, but over the years "Carrie" turned into "Children Of
The Corn". He's had more luck with "Stand By Me" and the psychological
thrillers "Misery" and "Shawshank Redemption".</P>
<P>"Thinner", based on the novel originally released as written by "Richard
Bachman", attempts to combine the two Kings for an occult thriller. It
almost succeeds for a short while, but rapidly deteriorates into another
schlockfest. The film's beginning draws you in and then takes a wrong
turn to go where almost every Stephen King movie has gone before.</P>
<P>Attorney Billy Halleck (Robert John Burke) lives the good life as a
distinguished member of the good ole boy network, complete with wife,
daughter and supposedly happy home life. He's fighting a losing battle
with his 300 pound weight while continually stuffing one thing after
another into his mouth. This all changes when Halleck runs into and
kills an old gypsy woman as he and his wife engage in an activity that
got Hugh Grant arrested.</P>
<P>His legal buddies rule the death accidental, but the ancient Gypsy king
isn't going to let him get away with killing his daughter and puts a
grisly curse on the lawyer. At first he is thrilled as the pounds melt
away, but then panics as he continues to lose weight no matter how much
he eats. He is literally wasting away. Desperate, he turns to a local
mobster for help and they both hunt down the band of Gypsies.</P>
<P>The major problem with the film is that there is not one sympathetic
person in the entire story. The main character, Halleck is initially the
one we identify with as the accident leads to his tremendous misfortune,
but as the film wears on (and it does) he turns into a vengeful dolt.
Even his loving wife is unmasked as a scheming liar.</P>
<P>The movie isn't helped by its perpetuation of the racist depiction of
Gypsies. They're easily the most interesting characters in the film, but
It makes you wonder how a people could survive when all of its members
are whores, killers and thieves. If this were any other minority group,
they'd be up in arms, but Gypsies probably don't go to the movies,
right?</P>
