<PRE>INSPECTOR GADGET</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  ** out of ****</PRE>
<P>About fifteen years ago, a cartoon called "Inspector Gadget" premiered
on American television featuring the voice of "Get Smart" star Don
Adams as a bumbling police detective with the unique characteristic of
being robotic.  Inspector Gadget did not have the self confidence of
the Six Million Dollar Man, nor the icy-cool visage of Robocop, but
instead was just an inept human being who happened to be partly
mechanical and loaded with a whole bunch of neat little devices.  Most
of his detective work was actually conducted by his niece, Penny, and
her dog, Brain, both of whom constantly accompanied or followed Gadget
to make sure that he stayed out of too much trouble.  </P>
<P>Today we're given David Kellogg's INSPECTOR GADGET, starring the
ever-youthful Matthew Broderick as the title character.  Gadget starts
out as John Brown, a security guard for a robotics research firm run
by Brenda (Joely Fisher) and her father (Rene Auberjonois).  The firm
is on the verge of completing work on a robotic prosthetic foot which
could be remotely controlled by the brainwaves of a human operator,
when the greedy tycoon Sanford Scolex (Rupert Everett) breaks into the
firm's lab, stealing the foot and killing Brenda's father in the
process.  Brown jumps into his Chevette and pursues Scolex, only to be
blown up by one of Scolex's innovative and fearsome weapons, an
explosive cigar.  As a result of the explosion, however, Brown's
bowling ball, which happened to be in the Chevette, flies into the air
and lands on Scolex's hand.  Scolex gets his hand replaced by a
mechanical claw, and renames himself, well, Claw.  Meanwhile, Brenda
uses all of her robotic wizardry to remake Brown, and Inspector Gadget
is born.  When Claw finds out about this mechanical wonder, however,
he becomes bent upon stealing the new technology to build an army of
Gadgets he can sell off to countries around the world.</P>
<P>INSPECTOR GADGET is a movie intended for kids, and on that level it
works pretty well.  It's got an uncomplicated plot, a lot of slapstick
comedy, and simple jokes.  Children will love it, but their parent
guardians may have a slightly less enjoyable experience.  First of
all, edits made after the trailers went to theaters serve to confuse
the attentive viewer by leaving out explanatory scenes.  For example,
Gadget goes to some kind of mayoral ball, but we have no idea why.  It
also seems that attendees are not surprised in the least that this
mechanical man is dancing in their midst.  Why?  Because the scene
showing that the ball was meant to debut Inspector Gadget was cut
completely.  I assume this missing scene was also where we get to see
why Police Chief Quimby (Dabney Coleman) harbors so much animosity for
his newest member of the force, since it's never explained
satisfactorily anywhere else in the film.  I really have to wonder why
these edits were made in the first place, as the film runs short at
about eighty minutes anyway.</P>
<P>Unlike the animated series, Penny (Michelle Trachtenberg) and Brain
are relegated to what amounts to barely supporting roles.  In fact,
they seem more of an afterthought homage to the original cartoon,
since their inclusion in the film is so superfluous that they could
have been left out altogether.  Too bad, as it would've been hilarious
to see a live action Brain following Gadget around and keeping him
safe.  Of course, they'd have to put that "No animals were harmed...."
disclaimer in big, bold letters at the end of the movie, as Brain was
frequently on the receiving end of exploding parcels and the like
which he intercepted before they reached Gadget.  It would seem that
in not exploring this possibility, the filmmakers passed up a great
opportunity for comedy and development of other characters (even if
one is a dog).</P>
<P>Speaking of the original show, you should know that it had no
connection to Disney whatsoever.  You wouldn't think so, the way the
live-action film version of the lovable cartoon is marketed in all
venues as "Disney's" INSPECTOR GADGET.  But there it is.  To be fair,
the possessive is more than mere credit grabbing.  Actually, the film
has that touch that plagues most of Disney's recent non-cartoon
features - just look at films like THE BIG GREEN, 101 DALMATIANS, or
THAT DARN CAT (with Christina Ricci, not Dean Jones), and you'll see a
certain quality of, oh, we'll call it goofy filmmaking (no reference
to the man-dog-thing intended).  INSPECTOR GADGET is laden with weird
sound effects that come out of nowhere for the sole reason of pushing
a scene over the edge and making it, well, goofy.  For example, a
billboard advertising the internet search engine Yahoo! falls on
someone, and as we see the logo come tumbling over, we hear the sound
effect of someone yelling, "Yahoo!"  Stuff like that occurs throughout
the film, and my reaction was that watching it was like watching an
episode of "Bill Nye, The Science Guy," which relentlessly uses the
same effects technique.  My girlfriend, by the way, very astutely
pointed out that "Bill Nye" is also produced by Disney.  Will someone
please give us a break?  Well, at least the billboard wasn't plugging
the internet's Go Network, which everything associated with Disney is
doing these days.</P>
<P>Shameless product placements also abound throughout the film, most
noticeably in Gadget's gadgetmobile.  Built right into the car's
console are buttons which, while never used, seem to dispense
Coca-Cola, Sprite, Skittles, M&M's, and a couple of other things which
we're supposed to go out any buy once the movie's over.  By the way,
the car also talks.  It's one of those ploys for the kids which adults
will find interminable, since the car doesn't say anything funny at
all, not even when it says, "You have to use your seat belt.  This is
a Disney movie."  It only reminded me of the painfully obvious.</P>
<P>Broderick actually does a pretty decent job filling the shoes of the
cartoon hero, although the screenplay doesn't require a whole lot of
the otherwise talented actor.  Unfortunately, the simplistic script
seems to almost visibly constrain the rest of the movie's players.  I
so much wanted Rupert Everett to have some juicy lines with which he
could take his character over the top.  He chews scenery, but it's
more like a nibble here and there, rather than the voracious feeding
frenzy I was hoping for.  Meanwhile, Joely Fischer's Brenda is
entirely forgettable.  As I write this review, I can't even recall a
line she had in the whole film.  The thing is, I can't fault her
because she displays a great acting range in a sequence where she
plays a dual role, and evidently could have really done a lot more
with Brenda if the script had only allowed it.  In the supporting
cast, Dabney Coleman has literally nothing to do, but is still cast
well as Quimby because he actually looks like the cartoon character.
Andy Dick as one of Claw's scientists and Cheri Oteri as the mayor
basically play the roles they play on television.  As Sykes, Claw's
minion, actor Michael G. Hagerty, supporting player in so many films
and various television episodes, stretches his acting range by
allowing us to see him for once without his mustache.  Wow.</P>
<P>But again, this film is for the kids anyway, and it's a lot of good,
clean fun for them, if not so much for you.  Just remember that:  It's
not for you.   In other words, don't go into the theater expecting a
reward for your years of watching the cartoon.  That will only
engender the kind of animosity you now have for George Lucas in making
STAR WARS EPISODE ONE:  THE PHANTOM MENACE.  And that's not very
productive, now is it?</P>
