<P>"Not every gift is a blessing" So say the ads heeding the release of
Hollywood Pictures surprise sleeper.  Director M. Night Shyamalan has
crafted a marvelously creepy and soulful tale of terror and
redemption.</P>
<P>The film opens with the celebration of psychologist, Dr. Malcolm Crowe
(Bruce Willis) and his wife Anna (Olivia Williams), after having
received a commendation from the Mayor of Philadelphia. Intoxicated
and relaxing, the loving couple is unaware of an intruder in their
house, Vincent Gray, (an unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg) distraught
over his treatment by Dr. Crowe. Unable to cope with his mania and
claiming to know why 'people are afraid when they're alone', Vincent
shoots Dr.  Crowe and then turns the gun on himself.</P>
<P>Several months later Dr. Crowe is a changed man. Disenchanted over the
failure of his treatment with Vincent Gray and the slow estrangement
of his marriage, Dr. Crowe anxiously needs the redemption that
successfully treating a patient would bring. His chance comes when he
meets 9 year old Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osmant), a boy traumatized by
his ability to see the dead. Slowly, Cole and Dr. Crowe build a
relationship. Slowly Dr. Crowe starts to believe the young boys
stories of otherworldly intervention. His investigation and research
lead him to evidence that these spirits visiting the boy may actually
looking for help. In a remarkably deft and heartfelt (not to mention
surprising) conclusion, Dr. Crowe manages to help the boy realize and
accept his gift while also coming to his own redemptive conclusion.</P>
<P>The script by Mr. Shyamalan is so deep with nuance and
characterization that one grows to appreciate and care about these
people. And when the ghosts start to make the manifestations physical,
the effect is startlingly chilling. The best filmic comparison would
possibly be the interesting "Jacob's Ladder'. What Mr. Shyamalan has
crafted is possibly one of the best, character rich horror films since
Robert Wise's "The Body Snatchers".</P>
<P>The performances are uniformly excellent, with Haley Joel Osmant
performance the standout. What showed as a promising debut as a young
Forrest in the classic "Forrest Gump", Haley Joel Osmant has grown
with each performance (most notably the underrated "Bogus", opposite
Gerald Depardieu). What young Mr. Osmant does in this film is nothing
less than extraordinary. With the subtlety of an Olivier, Mr.  Osmant
brings a truth and earnestness to his performance that is infective.
Within five minutes of screen time, one believes that this boy does in
fact see ghosts. I hereby cast my vote, and urge the Academy of Motion
Pictures and Sciences to set aside a Best Supporting Actor's nod to
this young talent. Mr. Osmant is more than worthy of it.</P>
<P>Bruce Willis, always maligned as an actor (everyone seems to forget
his marvelous performances in 1989's "In Country" and 1994's "Pulp
Fiction'), gives a retrained and poignant performance. His slow
realization of his situation and that of his young patient may be more
than he expects is so on key, that the revelatory denouncement of the
film is both surprisingly shocking and expected. An underrated
performer doing what he does best. Bringing nuance and depth to his
character, in such a way that it takes the audience off guard.</P>
<P>The best surprise in the film is Toni Collette as Lynn Sear, Cole's
single Mother. Unlike other film representations of parents in film,
Ms. Collette brings a degree of warmth to her role that is so
refreshing that it could be held as an example of single
parenting. The depth of her convictions and emotions are so well
realized that we respond to her passionately.  Also, while not being
the traditional Hollywood glamour type of parent, Ms. Collette's
physicality brings with it a comfortable familiarity. From her early
recognition in "Muriel's Wedding", Ms. Collette has proven herself to
be an actress of both depth and conviction. And those two qualities
shine in this film brightly.</P>
<P>To comment on M. Night Shyamalan's direction is to witness a
filmmaker, who is above all else a classic storyteller. Never does the
camera call attention to itself. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is
so unobtrusive that the shocks in the film do not seem to be set up,
coming as almost complete surprises.</P>
<P>Mr. Shyamalan's handling of even the quiet scenes is stunning. Most
notably is a sequence wherein Dr.  Crowe listens to the audio
recordings of his sessions with Vincent Gray. The slow, almost
cautious increase of volume, which finally reveals the ghostly voices
of those haunting Vincent, is marvelously cinematic. In his earlier
film 'Wide Awake" also dealt with the idea of death and the afterlife,
but with a lighthearted and sentimental approach. Here, with this film
the essence is on redemption.</P>
<P>Without revealing the ending of the film, one must conclude that not
all of the characters will be able to deal with the changes in their
lives. But the ultimate realization that the acceptance of death can
be more healing than any treatment can.</P>
<P>On a scale of one to five, "The Sixth Sense" rates a supernatural 4. A
marvelously creepy and thought provoking scare fest. One that will
have you talking for days.</P>
