<PRE>EXIT WOUNDS
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com

<P>To watch a Steven Seagal film, one must fully suspend all disbelief. 
And to fully enjoy the audacity of Seagal, one must ignore all of the
consequences associated with the following: Starting fistfights with
large men in flashy nightclubs, destroying everything in sight along the
way.  Surviving every semi-automatic gun battle and car crash without a
scratch.  Purchasing Italian racing cars with bundles of $100 bills
stuffed in a gym bag.  Actually being able to cash out stock options
from a dot-com and then creating a private surveillance unit devoted to
uncovering a ring of corrupt Detroit cops involved in smuggling heroin
inside of sweatshop-produced t-shirts.  OK... maybe that corrupt cops
thing is a bit hard to swallow.</P>
<P>I remember a time when I used to enjoy Seagal.  Such films as Above the
Law, Hard to Kill, Marked for Death, Under Siege, and Out for Justice
are all solid action films from the '90s.  Under Siege is even kind of
good.  But lately, films like Under Siege 2, Fire Down Below, and The
Patriot have shown the age of the Italian stallion of Aikido.</P>
<P>Now, Exit Wounds stands as Seagal's biggest failure, a pitiful reminder
of the death of the American action film.  By overextending the
violence, the ludicrousness, and the sheer improbability of everything,
Exit Wounds plays out like a circus of the damned with Tom Arnold
working the Tilt-A-Whirl.  (Speaking of Tom Arnold, it's always a bad
sign when his thespian attempts at comedy are the most memorable parts
of a film.)</P>
<P>Exit Wounds is bad -- really, really bad.  Should you care about the
plot, the mighty Steven plays Orin Boyd, a burned out cop without his
trademark pony-nub who gets reassigned to a tough Detroit precinct after
saving the Vice-President's life during a Michigan militia terrorist
act.  Apparently, this particular precinct is filled with police
officers who use the gym way too much, use stun guns in strange naked
homoerotic bonding moments, and routinely steal heroin from police labs
to fund those out-of-state fishing trips so popular among Detroit city
cops.  Then there's DMX, the hardcore rapper-turned-actor who does a
better job in his music videos than in this role as a stereotypical drug
dealer/club owner/martial arts master/dot-com entrepreneur.  Seagal and
DMX team up to stop the corrupt cop ring, run by Michael Jai White
(Spawn).</P>
<P>The gratuitous violence of Exit Wounds would have made Peckinpah cringe
and reach for the stop button on the remote.  In earlier Seagal films,
you got brief moments of violence that made the films memorable and not
so gory.  Exit Wounds overflows with carnage -- people being bloodied by
fists wrapped in chains, body parts being impaled on exposed bolts and
pipes, people being crushed by oncoming cars and buses.  And every
single car involved in a chase sequence erupts in flames, of course.</P>
<P>The biggest shame of the film is the misuse of Seagal.  Instead of
having Seagal demonstrate the prowess and speed of a 7th Dan of Aikido,
shown off so well in his earlier films, he ends up being nothing more
than a patsy, used to connect the dots of all the inane plot points in
what stands as a truly rotten film.</P>
