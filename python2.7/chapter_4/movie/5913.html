<PRE>                         THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU
                       A film review by Steve Rybin
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rybin</PRE>
<P>Directed by John Frankenheimer.  Starring Marlon Brando, Val Kilmer, 
David Thewlis.  Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Stan Winston's special effects and William Fraker's wonderful cinema-
tography are the main highlights in this retelling of H.G. Wells' novel.  
The movie has a terrific visceral impact, but it's hard to take it 
seriously at times: Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer both give over-the-top 
performances, and too often the film seem to be going for cheap laughs 
instead of moving the plot forward.</P>
<P>Brando plays Dr. Moreau, a brilliant scientist whose genetic experiments 
have gotten out of control.  Val Kilmer is his right-hand-man, but Kilmer 
doesn't get much screen time here.  David Thewlis' character, the lone 
survivor of a plane crash, becomes trapped on Moreau's island, and it 
doesn't take him long to figure out what is going on.</P>
<P>Frankenheimer's telling of this story is visually exciting and well-made, 
but the film is not quite sure what it wants to be.  For the first hour, 
it's straight-up science fiction with a bit of humor thrown in; the last 
forty minutes or so, it's basically an action-thriller.  It does, however,
 succeed at being consistently bizarre.</P>
