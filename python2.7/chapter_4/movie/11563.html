<P>   There comes a time in the life a many a successful comedy
writer that he pursues greater depth than a feathery play or
film can expose, however competent the wit.  With Neil
Simon, who began his career with the lighter-than-air and
very funny "Come Blow Your Horn" the moment came with
the less fortunate "God's Favorite."  Woody Allen, whose
talent with words allowed him to pen even a comedy which is
completely sung hit his serious stride with "Interiors," equally
foiled at the box office.  Edward Burns got the itch to write,
direct, and act in a more somber work at an earlier age,
perhaps stung that his abundantly funny "The Brothers
McMullen" and "She's the One"--the former premiering at the
1995 Sundance Festival while the latter was released a year
later by Fox Searchlight Pictures--was dismissed by some
critics as mere sitcom.  What emerges, "No Looking Back," is
indeed a more poignant, less slap-happy look at life among
the working classes in one of Queens, New York's more
remote locations.  Filmed in Rockaway Beach with a blue
patina, "No Looking Back" is not without humor, but its sober
tone matches the rainy weather which more often than not
afflicts the vicinity. Starring Lauren Holly as Claudia, Jon Bon
Jovi as her live-in boyfriend Michael, and the writer-director in
the role of former beau Charlie, the movie traces a few days
in the lives of three young people at about the age of thirty
who are already in the throes of a mid-life crisis.</P>
<P>   Michael and Claudia seem content enough sharing a
ramshackle but decently furnished house overlooking the
beach, but something is missing.  Michael is ready and eager
to get married, but Claudia, despite the pressure of friends
and family, is holding back.  It's not that Michael is a bad guy:
just the opposite, in fact.  He has the typical outlook of people
of his social class.  He is ambitious enough, willing to work
hard to support a wife and kids, but he has no vision. 
Claudia, who works as a waitress in a prosaic diner, harbors
inchoate desires that stretch beyond the borders of Queens. 
We do not wonder that since the roguish Charlie deserted her
when she needed him most and fled to California months
after making Claudia pregnant, his return to Rockaway Beach
at first seems to dismay Claudia as much as it does her
current live-in.  But Claudia, who had given up her adolescent
dreams at the age of thirty now sees new hope for reviving
her fantasies.  Looking back, she warms to the attentions of
the cur.</P>
<P>   Well acted by all parties, who adopt working class
mannerisms as though these were second nature, Burns's
picture has a way of infusing into the drama the entire culture
of the community.  Little things like a young diner's leaving a
dollar tip inside the leftover food in his dish and calling the
waitress "sweetheart," a gas pump jockey's brown-bagging his
lunch at the station as though to announce that he had long
ago given up aspiration, Charlie's own mother's outward
hostility to the boy whom she considers a layabout whose
presence could stir up the neighborhood once again.  Men
and women in equal numbers lay back scotches at the
crowded bar; card games become the scene of macho
posturing; unrepressed women freely announce their sexual
wishes to friends and potential partners.  Burns slips in some
telling dialogue, single utterances being enough to stir up
memories and ignite old passions.  "I told you you'd be
cleaning his dirty underwear, didn't I?" cajoles Charlie as he
watches his former flame fulfilling his predictions.</P>
<P>   This is the sort of movie that makes good, upright, family
values people wonder whether they perhaps should become
more assertive, and most of all, more carefree and even
indolent.  Many a well-groomed, neatly dressed and awfully
proper young man has been dismayed to find the object of his
affections turn away and dart into the arms of a rascal,
shedding light on the real consequences of family values. 
"No Looking Back"--which features small but effective roles
from Blythe Danner as Claudia's forlorn but understanding
mom and Connie Britton as her cynical sister Kelly--is
obligatory viewing for fans of the talented Edward Burns, who
began his film career with a movie that paid back investors
400-fold and who has now moved into the generally
uncharted waters of Rockaway Beach with a trenchant piece
about hidden yearnings. Rated R.  Running time: 96 minutes.
