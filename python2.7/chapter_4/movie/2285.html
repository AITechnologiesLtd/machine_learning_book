<PRE>                                   THE PIANO
                         A film review by Gareth Rees
                          Copyright 1993 Gareth Rees</PRE>
<P>     Time: sometime in the nineteenth century.  Holly Hunter plays Ada,
a beautiful and talented pianist.  She has a mighty will and, it seems,
has refused to speak since childhood.  Probably on account of her
having an illegitimate daughter (Flora, played by Anna Paquin) she is
still unmarried, until her father finds Stewart (Sam Neill), a
landowner in New Zealand, who is willing to marry her (English women
being scarce in that colony).</P>
<P>     The film opens with Ada's "inner voice" (we don't hear her speak
out loud during the film) narrating the above and then we cut to a
lonely New Zealand shore with men struggling through the surf to unload
Ada, her possessions, and her beloved piano (Ada's only means of
expressing herself).  Stewart comes to collect her, but does not
realise how important the piano is to Ada, and she is unable to tell
him.  It is left, half-uncrated, on the beach.</P>
<P>     Ada has trouble coping with the damp and the mud of the
settlement where Stewart lives.  She demands her piano and sulks when
she is told that she is not in Scotland anymore and that there are more
important things than music.</P>
<P>     Another landowner, Baines (Harvey Keitel) sees Ada and is smitten
by her.  Knowning how important the piano is to her, he fetches it from
the beach and offers it to her in return (at first) for letting him
watch her play, and (later) for sexual favours.  Improbably, she falls
in love with him, and inevitable tragedy follows.</P>
<P>     Director Jane Campion has said of the film (I'm quoting from
memory): "These people don't have twentieth century sensibilities about
sex; they aren't prepared for its raw power".  Certainly the behaviour
of the characters is strange from a modern perspective--Baines' lust
for Ada is easy to understand, but why Ada's for him?  I think the film
may be rooted in Nineteenth Century Romantic sensibilities more than
Campion would care to admit--Ada and Baines are supposed, I think, to
be fey and wayward people (Ada talks about being ruled by a powerful
Will and her music is completely alien to the characters in the film
other than Baines; Baines seems to have attempted to go native;
certainly he wears Maori tattooing) thrown together by an exotic and
dreamlike setting.</P>
<P>     In the light of this, the ending in which they find comfortable
domesticity is completely unconvincing--the briefly considered tragic
alternative ending in which she kills herself is the much more
emotionally convincing of the two.  I guess it isn't what audiences
want to see these days.</P>
<P>     The best part of the film, for me, was the music--Michael Nyman's
hypnotic, romantic, slightly naive piano melodies have to carry much of
the responsibility for conveying Ada's character, but I think he
succeeds magnificently.</P>
