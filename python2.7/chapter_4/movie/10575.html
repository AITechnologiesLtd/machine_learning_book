<PRE>THEY'RE GONNA KILL ME IN THE MOVIES
by Kristian Lin</PRE>
<P>Director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson are B.S. artists.  But
they're great B.S. artists, and they're getting better at it.  I'm one
of the minority who found much of the cleverness in the original SCREAM
to be pseudoclever and self-congratulatory (although, I admit, I enjoyed
it all the same).  I enjoyed SCREAM 2 even more, although I have some of
the same mixed feelings.</P>
<P>The sequel follows Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) to college, where she
has moved from Woodsboro (where the original movie's murders took place)
and now majors in theater.  Movie geek Randy (Jamie Kennedy) is there,
too, studying film.  So is a copycat killer, who strikes at the premiere
of a movie called "Stab," which is based on the account of the Woodsboro
murders by Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox).  Sure enough, Gale shows up
looking for her next story, as does Dewey (David Arquette), who wants to 
protect Sidney.</P>
<P>The killer's first three victims are college students played by Omar
Epps, Jada Pinkett, and Sarah Michelle Gellar.  This totally wiped me
out.  At least the black couple gets an entertaining conversation about
the absence of African-Americans in slasher movies (Pinkett watches
Heather Graham playing Drew Barrymore's part in "Stab" and says, "Bitch,
hang up the phone and star 69 his ass.")  But the incisive, dewy-eyed
Gellar doesn't even get a chance to register.  Fortunately, some
compensation comes from the other actors.  The brawny Jerry O'Connell
proves unexpectedly light on his feet as Sidney's boyfriend, and he gets
to serenade her in a cafeteria with "I Think I Love You" (à la Rupert
Everett in MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING).  Liev Schreiber only had a cameo
in SCREAM as Cotton Weary, the man wrongly accused of Sidney's mother's
murder.  The role is considerably expanded here, and he disturbingly
suggests that Cotton might be guilty of something after all.</P>
<P>But all these new faces only drew my attention to the old ones, and I
made some observations that escaped me when I saw the original.  Then
again, maybe it was just Neve Campbell's hair that made me think about
her acting.  Her hair, long in the original, is bobbed here.  The new
'do leaves her face more exposed, and it makes her look leaner, as if
the various tragedies in her life have scraped her down to the bone. 
But it also drew my attention to her facial expressions, and she only
uses a few in the SCREAM movies.  She has the one scared look, and then
she adjusts it slightly for her tough look, when she faces down the
killer.   Then she has that toothy grin that she occasionally flashes. 
I'm not a "Party of Five" watcher, so I might be missing something.  But
the SCREAM plots seem to be limiting her range - as she's written,
Sidney Prescott is a normal young woman who just happens to have had
four people in her life murder 11 other people.  Sidney's seen so much
death, you wouldn't blame her if she snapped and started slashing up
victims herself in SCREAM'S inevitable third installment.  And beyond
that, I don't know who she is.  This isn't all or even half Campbell's
fault.  But she doesn't suggest any more about the character.</P>
<P>Character problems hamper Courteney Cox, too.  Not that she has the
wrong attitude - on the contrary, she seems relieved to indulge the
nasty side that her Monica Geller frequently represses on "Friends." 
But Gale Weathers really needed an actress who could be mean in broader
strokes, say, Kelly Preston.  Cox's subtler skills fit the TV screen and
would probably do really well in smaller movie roles, but in a part like 
this, she doesn't fill the bill.  Further, Williamson tries to
complicate Gale by showing her concern for Dewey - her one redeeming
feature.  It's an admirable impulse, but the writer doesn't make it jibe
with the rest of the character.  Cox, a smart actress, seems unsure of
the precise boundaries of Gale's bitchiness.  I'm not sure myself.  The
part was smaller in the original, but it's only going to expand, and it
needs to be fixed.</P>
<P>I came out of SCREAM 2 feeling energized by its cleverness but also with
the same oddly depressed feeling I got from the original.  It isn't that
I have Gene Siskel's prejudice against serial killer movies - they're as
formulaic as any other film genre, and I think THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS
may still be the decade's greatest film.  That movie boasted a literate,
rational, superintelligent killer fully capable of assessing situations
and analyzing other people.  Killers in these movies tend to be mute
death machines who kill people without distinction.  Well, but what
about the monster in the ALIEN movies?  OK, that killer isn't
interesting, but its potential victims are fully developed people
(especially Ripley, of course, and her shipmates in the first movie). 
The victims in most slasher movies are just as much cardboard figures as
the murderer.  That's less the case in the SCREAM movies - the
characterizations are still thin, but at least they're somewhat
defined.  The problem is that they're all helpless in the face of this
killer, which annihilates dramatic possibilities.  The great cast in
SCREAM 2 only highlights this; you can't help watching the demises of
Epps, Pinkett and Gellar without lamenting the waste of perfectly good 
actors.  These movies are fun, but wasn't the final confrontation in THE
SILENCE OF THE LAMBS all the more nerve-wracking because you knew who
Clarice Starling and Jame Gumb were?</P>
<P>My favorite moment in SCREAM 2 is when Randy strikes back at the killer
during their phone conversation.  He starts off sarcastically, saying
that his favorite scary movie is SHOWGIRLS.  Eventually, though, he
turns insulting.  "Why are you imitating a couple of high school
losers?" he yells into the phone, and he starts casting aspersions at
the original killers, particularly Billy Loomis, whom Randy
characterizes as a repressed homosexual mama's boy.  Randy is killed a
moment later, and his verbal outburst is his final blaze of glory.  His
smart-ass attitude makes him a marginally more deserving candidate for
death than the others, but he also hits the killer's psychological weak
spot.  It's like Dennis Hopper goading Christopher Walken into killing
him in TRUE ROMANCE.  Randy's victory is only a moral one (and, like
most moral victories, an empty one), but he does what no one else in the
two movies manages to do.  Sidney and Gale stop the killers, but only
Randy makes him lose control.  It's one moment where the SCREAM
franchise touches greatness.</P>
