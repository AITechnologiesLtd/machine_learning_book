                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1997 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>First off I should confess that I am not a Howard Stern fan. I primarily
attribute this to the fact that I have not lived in a market where I
could hear him on the radio. I'll also have to admit that I never
thought that my life was incomplete due to this lack of experience.</P>
<P>Until this film, "Howard Stern" was more of a concept than a person. Now
we see the man behind the shock jock  =97 at least we see the image  that=</P>
<P>the man behind the shock jock wants us to see. Although it's impossible
to determine the truth of the person, there is one fact that is
indisputable: Stern is certainly the virtuoso of self-promotion.</P>
<P>>From a very early age, the outrageous radio personality wanted to be
famous and discovered that scandal was a sure way to achieve that goal.
After overcoming his initial on-air shyness, "Howierd" hit the country
by storm although like most overnight sensations, it took him years to
get there.</P>
<P>The rally where he accepts the honor of being New York's most popular DJ
in front of thousands of screaming (and semi-nude) fans occupies a major
point in the film and was obviously a major highlight in his life.</P>
<P>Stern's public persona is the man who pushes the envelope of decency as
far as, if not further than, it can go. He sneaks the words you can't
say on radio into a quiz show skit ("Complete the phrase: 'Blank
Willow'."). He has radio sex with one of his listeners on air by having
her sit on her speaker with the bass turned up as he hums into the
microphone. He conducts the world's first radio interview with a naked
woman while she massages him on the studio floor.</P>
<P>His epic battles with the powers that be at NBC, especially his nemesis
"Pig Vomit", are at the heart of the Howard Stern The Hero portion of
the film. You can't help but root for the everyman jerk as he takes on
the corporate jerks.</P>
<P>Now we have his new public image. He's also the man who fell in love and
has stayed faithful to the same woman for over 20 years. He's the
devoted father of a brood of lovely children. He's probably even kind to
dogs. Methinks reality lies somewhere inbetween.</P>
<P>Stern plays himself as does his on-air team. They are all naturals at
being themselves: a task undoubtedly more difficult than it seems. He
and his partners-in-crime Robin Quivers and Fred Norris are often
hilarious even as they go for the lowest level of humor possible.</P>
<P>With this film, Stern has made his splash in yet another medium. It
remains to be seen if he can portray anyone other than himself, but he
is magnificent in this role. Its the one he was born to play.</P>
<P>There are many similarities between "Private Parts" and "The People
Versus Larry Flynt". Both feature men who are public sleazeballs shoving
the limits of free speech, but privately have a heart of gold. Both are
about figures that publicly treat women in a less than PC fashion, but
behind closed doors conduct long term loving relationships.</P>
<P>Perhaps we are seeing the beginning of a new trend in films. I can't
help but wonder if the next thing to look forward to is "Rush Limbaugh:
The Movie".</P>
