<P>Sleepy Hollow by John Sylva    Rating: C+</P>
<P>Tim Burton is one of the few directors in Hollywood that can realistically
label himself as a true "artist," rather than simply a "moneymaker" or just a
plain, old "director."  Burton brings a high level of originality to each of
his films, whether it be through breathtaking scenery, fast pacing, or oddball
themes.  Also the director of 1989's masterful Batman and its 1992 sequel
Batman Returns, Burton can take the most unoriginal or mediocre of scripts, and
transform them into spellbinding pieces of art.  Unfortunately, for the first
time I can remember, Burton doesn't deliver his usual promise as an artist,
creating one of his few films that aren't absorbing from start to finish.  The
screenplay for Sleepy Hollow, written by (Andrew Kevin Walker), the classic
tale of the headless horseman, told by any older brother or sister to their
younger siblings to give them a fright, ruins what could have been a
mesmerizing masterpiece, riding on the same mediocre level of many modern
Hollywood films.</P>
<P>Exactly like the tale of "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow," originally written by
Washington Irving, Sleepy Hollow takes place in a small, eerie town of the same
name where constable Ichabod Crane (a lighter Johnny Depp) ventures to
investigate the murders of several persons, in which the head of each victim
hasn't been found.  Townspeople gossip about the cause for the common
atrocities is the Headless Horseman, a fierce, menacing and well,  headless
character who rides through the woods on his dashing horse, beheading those who
he pleases.  The story behind the villain frightens the clumsy Crane, as he
will be the one venturing into the wilderness to find and explore the legend
that haunts the minds of the townspeople.</P>
<P>On his first night of visiting Sleepy Hollow he meets Katrina Van Tassel (the
fabulous Christina Ricci), daughter of Baltus (Michael Gamdon) and Lady Van
Tassel (Miranda Richardson).  From that night on, Katrina will serve as a
sidekick of sorts to Ichabod, standing by his side for much of the remainder of
the film.  These two along with a large ensemble cast, including Casper Van
Dien and Jeffrey Jones, fight to survive, as the Headless Horseman strikes
numerous times over the course of the film.  Once the exposition of Sleepy
Hollow is pieced together, the film becomes a beautifully told, yet lifeless
thriller that certainly has its moments of brilliance, but all in all fails to
deliver.</P>
<P>The cinematography in Sleepy Hollow is indescribable.  From the first frame of
film to the last, the settings are magnificently beautiful, every little thing,
from a tree to simple grave, Sleepy Hollow brings forth spellbinding images,
fog floating abound in almost every scene, the sky always at a twilight gray. 
For this reason, Sleepy Hollow will be looked at by me as a clever work of art,
not for it's script or acting, but for the scenery.  Sleepy Hollow sets a new
standard for how shockingly wonderful a movie's backdrop can be, not for a
second looking the least bit ordinary.</P>
<P>Johnny Depp, who was starting to become one of the downright creepiest actors
in the business, lightens up a few notches from his role in last summer's
surprisingly good film, The Astronaut's Wife.  Depp is flawless as his
character, even if the lackluster screenplay does feed him a few laughably
ridiculous lines here and there, giving him more than enough lame humor to act
out.</P>
<P>Christina Ricci matures more and seems more sophisticated in every role she
appears in, as she went from playing the little girl in Casper to Ichabod's
sidekick in a film based on perhaps one of the greatest, most frightening
legends ever to be told, in just 5 years.  Ricci shows increasing promise with
each performance she delivers, a promise showing that in coming year,s she will
be looked upon as this generation's Susan Sarandon, or even Jodie Foster. 
Ricci conducts herself with such wisdom and perfection here, it's disappointing
the film isn't as compelling and as satisfactory as her performance is.   </P>
<P>Never did I think I'd be comparing Tim Burton films to low grade, campy slasher
fare, but Sleepy Hollow is nothing but a mediocre slasher flick with beefed up
visuals.  What makes Sleepy Hollow lesser of a film compared to other
kill-â€˜em-by-the-numbers flicks is that in the 1996 masterpiece Scream, and
many films with similar themes to it, the predictability level is low because
the battles are between two humans, and anything could be the result.  In
Sleepy Hollow, the battle is between a super human and regular man, resulting
in no suspenseful sequences, as we can always tell who is going to win in a
showdown.  Without a few rare, choice sequences, and the astounding
cinematography, Sleepy Hollow would be as bad as they get, resulting in one of
the worst films of the year, but thank goodness Tim Burton is here to save the
film from such an awful fate.    </P>
<P>Tim Burton has everything established for a bang up, shocking culmination, but
Sleepy Hollow's resolution is lifeless and mediocre, not suiting the capability
of the film.  A visual heaven it may be, but Sleepy Hollow cannot stand on
images alone.  Although Burton isn't at fault, his latest venture into his own
genre is better saved for a weekend movie rental, said even though Sleepy
Hollow is without a doubt the most beautiful movie of the decade.   </P>
<P>The Bottom Line: A visual masterpiece.  A technical flop.</P>
