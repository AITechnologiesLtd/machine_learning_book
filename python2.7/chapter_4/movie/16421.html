<PRE>Seven Years in Tibet</PRE>
<PRE>As reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>Finally, a well done piece of cinema! To see it this year is like finding an
oasis in the desert and drinking your full, a refreshing experience. As of
this point, I could and still can count the serious Oscar contenders on my
hands and feet, and "Seven Years in Tibet" ranks among them.</P>
<P>Brad Pitt actually surprised me (although the accent was a little poor),
with his wonderful portrayal of mountain climber Heinrich Harrer, a man who
left his home to climb the ninth highest mountain in the world, and ended up
having everything he ever knew changed. He turns on the charm for the camera
and for the film, actually making you perfectly connect with this different
character in them midst of World War II.</P>
<P>As is all-too-much used but timeless, a major theme of the movie is changing
of ideals from imperialistic to anti-imperialistic, placing the viewpoint of
Harrar among that of Oscar Schindler (although "Schindler's List" was by far
a greater movie). Also thrown in to put him next to the greats is his hate
of nationalistic pride, a trait exhibited by Count Almasy in "The English
Patient".</P>
<P>For those of you who think I am beginning to downplay the movie, make no
mistake : this is the best film of the year so far (With possible future
exceptions being "Boogie Nights", "Les Miserables" and "Titanic"., which,
with "Contact", would make up this years nominees.). Its characters deeply
move you, you fall in love with the Tibetan landscape, and it enters into
your mind and heart like few movies can.</P>
<P>Not made for the mass market, if you are someone looking for a load of fun
at the movies, then go see "I know what you did last summer". If you're
looking for a masterwork of modern cinema, see "Seven Years in Tibet".</P>
