<P>   While I was watching David Cronenberg's latest sci-fi-
horror tale I got to thinking about a character in Georg
Buchner's expressionistic drama "Woyzeck."  The title person
in that play is a stupid soldier trying to make sense out of life,
a man who is exploited by his girl friend and his superior
officers.  One day, while he is cutting the hair of his
commanding officer, the captain surprises Woyzeck by
expressing envy of him.  "You don't know what it's like to be
in the shoes of an intelligent person," he complains.  I have
to think about ways to spend the long waking hours of my
days.  I'm frightfully bored."  The captain's assumption,
however questionable, is that folks of lesser intelligence are
like, say, cats.  They can spend time alone without reading,
without watching TV, and they seem not to get weary of life. 
Most of us human beings, though--particularly those with jobs
that do not greatly challenge us--have to dream up ways to
occupy ourselves constructively in order to make time pass
quickly.  The great paradox of life is that the faster time goes
by, the better use you are making of your existence.  And the
key to this nirvana is to become wholly involved in what
you're doing.</P>
<P>   What do you do to become wholly involved?  If you're
lucky, you have exciting work that allows you to begin at 9,
spend what seems like an hour on the job, and, poof: it's 5
o'clock.  There are other means of becoming absorbed,
immersed, engrossed.  Reading.  Theater.  Inspiring
relationships with other people, both physical and intellectual.
Movies.  Interactive computing.  And now, with the approach
of the millennium, newer and better amusements involving
virtual reality.  You hook up to a gadget and are plunged into
a world of illusion not unlike your dreams.  In the near future,
you may plug the cord not into the wall but into yourself in
order to become totally a part of this dreamworld.  Like Alice
in Wonderland you submerge deeper and deeper into a hole
into a strange land.  Do this enough and you will have
increasing difficulty separating your real life from your
illusions.  This brings us to "eXistenZ," an illusory adventure
that takes twelve of Cronenberg's characters away from their
everyday routines and plunges them together into a kind of
acid trip.  </P>
<P>   In the plot, volunteers have agreed to become guinea pigs
for a beta testing of a game called eXistenZ, created by
Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh)--who is considered the
world's foremost designer of games of virtual reality.  We
learn early on that Allegra, like so many compulsive computer
nerds, is a shy person who likes to surrender her real self to
her "game character," in which she can say and do whatever
comes to mind.  Two players are in every scene, Allegra and
Ted Pikul (Jude Law), the latter a reluctant and equally shy
fellow who acts as Allegra's security guard and is not at all
eager to participate in eXistenZ.  He fears the pain of having
a hole drilled into his spine for the insertion of an umbilical
cord to which a "pod" is attached and has doubts about
abdicating control to his game character.  During their
adventures together in what becomes a Cronenbergian
nightmare, Ted and Allegra are pursued by a group of
terrorists whose goal is to destroy the makers of "satanic"
games, and because of the presence of moles, they are
unsure who their friends are and whom they should avoid.  Is
Gas (Willem Dafoe), a friend or foe?  He seems the former,
as he is able to repair a defective pod and hook up the two
principals.  What about Kiri Vinokur (Ian Holm), a scientist
who is experimenting with eerie-looking creatures, one of
which resembles a beating heart on which he is operating?  </P>
<P>   The most frightening scene occurs in a Chinese restaurant
to which Allegra and Ted have repaired following a half day
of work in a trout-processing plant.  Allegra suspects that the
waiter, a particularly friendly guy who recommends bass but
who brings them the day's special, is a terrorist bent on
destorying her games.  When she orders Ted to shoot the
server with a gun he puts together comically from the
creatures that make up the dish, Ted hesitates before
blowing the man away.</P>
<P>   The principal gimmick of the movie is that neither we nor
the players know when they are in the game or when they
have returned to reality.  At one point Ted calls a time out,
plunging Allegra and him from the restaurant to a bed in a ski
lodge.  Is the lodge part of the game or are they back in their
real lives?</P>
<P>   The object of this allegorical fable is obviously enough to
warn us partly about the dangers of technology in general but
specifically about the hazards of spending too much time
playing computer games.  To get a life, Cronenberg only
indirectly suggests, we should spend more time nurturing
human relationships--not by e-mailing or instant-
messengering cyberfriends but by getting in touch with them,
flesh to flesh, and solving the Big Problem "what shall we do
with all the time the time on our hands" by fostering
friendships.  Any attempt to give in to shyness and give
ourselves over to the glitter of mechanical substitutes will
further our neuroses and lead to the mayhem to which Ted
and Allegra become privy.</P>
<P>   This is a worthy theme to tackle, and Cronenberg seizes
the day with the style which has become his trademark from
movies like "The Fly," "The Dead Zone," and especially
"Videodrome"--sleazy sets, slimy creatures, Frankenstein-
style machinery, Kafkaesque ambiance, and in this case a
dazzlingly eerie soundtrack that does much to further
suspense and anticipation.  Though the movie is involving
enough, what is unusual is that the opening one-third--the
part that takes place apparently before the virtual reality
game has begun--is more absorbing that the balance.  If the
great Canadian director has made the realistic segment the
most arresting portion of the film, has he succeeded as in the
past in portraying the intensity of mutated existence? 
Unfortunately, while "eXistenZ" is far superior to some of his
relative failures like "Naked Lunch," we cannot put this movie
in the same class as his model study of human frailty and
decay, "The Fly," nor is Jude Law in any way as compelling a
performer as the great Jeff Goldblum.  But Jennifer Jason
Leigh, who in the past loved to play the absolute cynic with
curled lip and gutteral voice, has never looked and sounded
sexier.  Though early reviews warned us about shocking
bodily flowerings, there is nothing in this film that is scarier
than a plate of mildly mutated lobster and crabs nor is a hole
drilled in the spine to which a cord is inserted a particularly
hair-raising image.</P>
<P>   Let's hope in any case that Cronenberg does not succeed 
in having his warning taken too seriously by the audience. If
he does, look for a precipitous fall-off of the weekly movie
audience as people stop passing time gazing at the big
screen and instead visit one another to cultivate their human
relationships.</P>
