<PRE>GET CARTER</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>*</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Stephen T. Kay
Written by: Ted Lewis (novel), David McKenna</P>
<P>Jack Carter (Sylvester Stallone) beats people up for a living. Or, as he 
says, people make promises and break them; he refreshes their memories (I 
still don't get that. They broke the promise, they didn't forget it. Oh 
well). When his brother dies in a car accident, Jack goes back to his 
hometown to find out what happened to him. He meets his brother's daughter, 
Doreen (Rachael Leigh Cook), who obviously doesn't like Jack, but confides 
in him that she doesn't think her father's death was an accident. He 
proceeds to question his sister in-law, Gloria (Miranda Richardson); his 
brother's boss, Cliff (Michael Caine); Cyrus, an old acquaintance who now 
runs a porn shop (Mickey Rourke); and a rich computer geek named Jeremy 
Kinnear (Alan Cumming). None of them will give him straight answers, so Jack 
decides to beat the information he needs out of anyone he can find. He says 
he's going to fix things, but as Gloria points out, Jack doesn't fix things, 
he breaks things.</P>
<P>Ahh where to begin. Let me start by saying that there is really nothing good 
about "Get Carter". I mean nothing at all. I hunted and searched endlessly 
for a good thing here, pinching myself occasionally to stay awake. Alas, it 
was all for naught. It's never a good sign when the car chases bore you, the 
story loses you, the jokes hurt you, and the nicest thing you can say about 
the movie is, "boy, that's a nice looking golf course." That was a very nice 
looking golf course by the way. Wish I could play there. It was nestled away 
on a mountain, perfectly kept, surrounded by a deep forest of evergreen 
trees. Beautiful scenery. Sorry, I just don't want to talk about the stupid 
movie. Still, I can't procrastinate any longer, so here goes.</P>
<P>Try to imagine getting deposited right in the middle of a film that makes no 
sense at all. When I first walked in, I thought I'd somehow missed half the 
movie since the characters were all talking to each other like we were 
supposed to know what was going on. Here's an example of the dialogue 
between Sly and one of the Bobs from "Office Space". Bob: "I've covered your 
a** for long enough Jack." Sly: "What are you talking about?" (my sentiments 
exactly) Bob: "Well, you know, people are talking about you and Gertrude (or 
something like that, I just remember her name started with a "G")." Sly: "If 
people are talking it's because you gave them something to talk about." Now, 
bear in mind, this is at the very start of the film. We don't know who 
Gertrude is, who Bob (that's not the character's name, but that's what I 
kept mentally calling him) is, what Jack's job is, what in the world is 
going on. Already I was starting to not really care all that much. None of 
these questions are ever fully answered (especially not the last one), and I 
never did start caring what was going on. I tried my best though dang it, I 
tried to get into this story, but I couldn't. It was too... too... what's 
the word I'm looking for? Stupid! That's it.</P>
<P>As for the actors, first up we have the great Sly Stallone. Sly's career has 
been on the rocks lately, and he... uhh.. line? Sorry, Sly's career has been 
on the rocks, and he needed a boost to rev-reval-revitilz... line? Sly 
needed this movie to revitalize his diminishing career, after box-office 
failures such as... uhh.. line? Forget it, take five. Sorry about that 
folks, but Sly's acting in "Get Carter" really is that bad. The man looks 
completely lost during half his scenes, and I'm willing to wager they took 
several hundred takes before he got it right. During a few of the so-called 
"dramatic" moments, he has long pauses during his varied speeches, during 
which he gazes into the distance for dramatic effect. I'm sorry, but it 
looks like he forgot his lines and is looking desperately for cue cards 
somewhere. Miranda Richardson ("Sleepy Hollow"), is wasted in nearly every 
movie she appears in these days, that trend doesn't change with "Get 
Carter". The great Michael Caine ("The Cider House Rules") is completely 
wasted as the brother's friend and boss. I didn't think it was possible for 
Mickey Rourke ("The Rainmaker") to be considered wasted (I'm usually fairly 
happy when he has limited screen time), but it was pulled off here. Robin 
Leigh Cook ("She's All That") plays Robin Leigh Cook to the hilt, looking 
vaguely like a deer caught in the headlights of a semi; and the less said 
about Alan Cumming ("Titus") the better off we'll all be. Don't ask me to 
explain Bob's (John C. McGinley) presence, or the character's significance 
in the story, because I can't.</P>
<P>I don't get it. How does a movie this bad get made in this day and age? 
Don't the studios read the scripts before green-lighting a film? Guess not. 
I'd like to say that in the hands of a more capable director this could have 
been something, but that's not the case. Still, the direction (if you can 
call it that) from relative newcomer Stephan T. Kay doesn't help matters. To 
start with, I like a movie that throws me right into the middle of the plot; 
a movie that skips all that often pointless exposition of plot that will be 
revealed again later on. What I don't like is a movie that throws us into 
the middle of things and never explains itself, and "Get Carter" is just 
that kind of movie. Kay seems to consider himself something of an Oliver 
Stone fan, since he's fond of quick cuts all over the place, sudden shifts 
to slow motion, and anything else he can think of to "dazzle" the eye. Yet 
while Stone's technique is irritating, Kay's is excruciating. I didn't think 
it was possible to mangle a car chase to the point where you could no longer 
tell who was driving what, or who just smashed into whom, but Kay manages to 
do it. Or how about this? Sly walks up the stairs, putting on leather gloves 
and getting ready to crack some skulls. Rather than just filming Sly walking 
up the stairs, Kay films Sly walking up the stairs in quick little bursts. 
First he's at the bottom, then half-way up, then at the top. Why was it 
filmed like this? Possibly to make the film look more artistic (heh), but 
your guess is as good as mine.</P>
<P>Next up we have the dialogue, which is amusingly bad at its best, painful at 
its worst. Here are a few examples: "You've got as much chance as a one 
legged man in an a** kicking contest." Gee, clever Sly, never heard that one 
before. Sly approaches Alan Cumming on that neat looking golf course. Alan: 
"Who are you?" Sly: "Tiger Woods." Wow, that was clever too. Mickey Rourke, 
referring to his eyes: "Are they still pretty?" Sly: "Yeah, pretty like cat 
urine in the snow." Now that was REALLY clever. One of my "favorite" lines 
from Sly was "We're going to take this to the next level." He only says it 
twice, but it was old the first time. Hey Sly, how about taking your acting 
to the next level? Didn't think so. The film's score, from composer Tyler 
Bates is grating, obnoxious, and fairly useless. "Get Carter" runs an unholy 
115 minutes, which should have been cut down to.. uh.. well it just should 
have been cut. I'd recommend the movie to those who think Stallone was 
jilted when he didn't get an Oscar nomination for "Judge Dredd", and give 
the film a much deserved one out of five stars. One last note, I know I had 
a full plot summary up there, but here's the real plot: Jack asks question, 
person won't answer, Jack threatens then with cheesy catch phrase or twists 
a limb till they cry uncle, person answers. What's the final threat of the 
movie? Possible sequel is hinted at. Uncle! Uncle!</P>
