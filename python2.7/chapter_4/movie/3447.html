<PRE>                                  ROB ROY
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Robert Roy MacGregor (1671-1734) is the most famous of the
Scottish MacGregor clan.   It was he who fought to keep the clan
together despite the poverty they faced and the greed of the lords.
The photography of the film is something to behold; its lakes and
mountains and the barrenness of so much of the country.  This is all
captured by Director of Photography, Karl Walter Lindenlaub.</P>
<P>     Rob Roy (Liam Neeson) is a cattle drover.  When he seeks to better
his condition for his wife (Jessica Lange) and his family, he borrows
1,000 pounds from his lord, the Marquis of Montrose  (John Hurt) in
order to buy cattle and make a profit. The money is stolen from him
and he must now repay his lord.  How the stealing came about and how
he is harassed is the story of the film.</P>
<P>     What lifts the movie way up is the acting of Tom Roth who plays
the role of Cunningham, a fop, a dandy, and a most malicious villain
whose face never loses its constant sneer.  Roth just about steals the
film from the much better known Neeson and Lange.</P>
<P>     The only thing that made me laugh was in a final duel when he
takes off his wig (which all the nobility wore) and tosses it aside
while I thought ""No more Mr Nice Guy."</P>
<PRE>     Also in the cast is Eric Stoltz who seems to be in everything
these days.</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Michael Caton-Jones.</PRE>
