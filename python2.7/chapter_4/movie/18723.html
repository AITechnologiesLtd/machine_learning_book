<P>So the theatrical trailer set the film up to be an exciting thriller, 
when in actuality it is a deliberately-paced prison drama. I can live 
with this deceivement, of course, because motion picture trailers 
falsely advertise all the time (remember how 1998's marvelous "Rushmore" 
was billed as a crazy, lowbrow, madcap comedy?). What is an outrage, 
however, is how director Jon Turteltaub's "Instinct" is a direct rip-off 
of hundreds of other movies, and not even a passable one at that, as it 
piles on such thick, nauseating layers of weepy, unbelievable melodrama 
when, judging from the overall premise, we should be on the edge of our 
seats. Do not put the blame on the actors for this film's failings, 
although they all should have known better. No, the culprits of 
"Instinct" are Turteltaub, whose direction is flat and emotionless (even 
though, strangely enough, the characters all wear their caricaturized 
emotions on their sleeves), and screenwriter Gerald DiPego, adapting 
from the 1992 novel, "Ishmael," by Daniel Quinn, who apparently has no 
idea how to construct interesting or stimulating dialogue. If anything, 
DiPego does have the non-virtue of corniness down pat.</P>
<P>"Instinct" begins as dedicated primatologist Ethan Powell (Anthony 
Hopkins) is being transported to the run-down Harmony Bay Correctional 
Facility, following a 2-year disappearance within the jungles of Rwanda, 
where he lived with the apes, and the animalistic murders of two park 
rangers. Enter novice psychiatrist Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding Jr.), who 
is assigned to take on the case by his mentor, Dr. Ben Hillard (Donald 
Sutherland), and travel down to Harmony Bay to speak with Powell, who 
has since stopped talking and obtained a nasty temper, to put it mildly. 
After arriving, Caulder is almost instantly repulsed by the way the 
inmates are treated by the prison warden (John Aylward) and guards, 
being shocked or severely beaten simply for looking at their superiors 
crossway. After their first few meetings, Powell surprisingly begins to 
talk again, discussing his tranquil experiences among the apes of the 
Rwanda jungles, as well as his apprehension to reunite with his loving 
daughter (Maura Tierney), whom he feels he has drifted too far from for 
their relationship to be salvaged. There's really not much more to 
discuss story-wise, since the majority of the running time is dedicated 
to endless babbling between Caulder and Powell, neither of whom have 
anything worthwhile to say to each other.</P>
<P>"Instinct" is a strange film, indeed. On one end is the relationship 
that forms between Powell and Caulder. Many viewers have compared this 
film to "The Silence of Lambs," but they have very few similarities, 
even though Powell is supposed to be a killer, and the performance by 
Hopkins is very different than that of Hannibal Lecter. As Caulder 
learns more and more about why Powell was lead to murder after his 
beloved apes began to be hunted, we are supposed to believe that Caulder 
has a life-changing transformation. This aspect of the film is about as 
easy to swallow as a chicken bone, and when Caulder tells Powell in the 
groan-inducing climax that he has been "saved," I didn't believe it for 
a second. For one, how can audiences understand how Caulder has been 
saved when throughout the film, the only thing we learn about him is 
that he is a young psychiatrist. Do we learn about his past? His family? 
No. Apparently he has no actual life outside of his profession, and it 
is this problem that thoroughly peeves me. Why exactly is it that in the 
majority of films about lawyers or psychiatrists, we are never allowed 
to learn anything about them? Are screenwriters so lazy, or clueless, in 
today's times to write at least a few scenes in which we actually get to 
know the characters? I guess so. And the sight of Caulder late in the 
film, with his arms outstretched in the middle of a rainstorm, is 
blatant plagarism of 1994's somewhat similar prison drama, "The 
Shawshank Redemption."</P>
<P>Unexpectedly, about half of the running time is actually dedicated to 
the way the one-dimensional guards and warden abuse the inmates which, I 
guess, is a direct ode to "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." This 
subplot is written in such a heavy-handed, manipulative manner that we 
are even pushed to suffer through an "uplifting" riot scene, headed by 
Caulder, who wants to overthrow the unjust way in which the inmates are 
chosen to go outside each day (it is done by giving out playing cards, 
and the winner is the holder of the ace of diamonds). As everyone begins 
to chant the same triumphant thing in unison, one at a time they tear up 
their cards and through them to the floor. This is peeve #2 in the 
annals of syrupy moviemaking.</P>
<P>Finally, the third section of the film, which is given the least amount 
of time but is the only bearable one, deals with Powell's neglected 
daughter. A possible romance is brought up briefly between Caulder and 
she, but it is quickly dropped, leaving me to wonder why the whole scene 
wasn't simply cut out. This subplot does mildly work, nonetheless, 
mainly because of Maura Tierney's touching performance and it holds the 
best scene in the film, the inevitable reunion between father and 
daughter.</P>
<P>Aside from the disasterous writing and directing, "Instinct" has its 
fair share of other problems, as well, beginning with the painfully 
overlong 2-hour-plus running time, about fifteen minutes of which is 
unnecessarily dedicated to Powell sitting around in the jungle with the 
apes. Speaking of the scenes set in the Rwandan jungles, it is so poorly 
shot, and the cinematography, by Philippe Rousselot, so insipid, that it 
more or less could have been filmed in the woods right next to my house. 
The usually reliable composer Danny Elfman (long-time collaborator with 
Tim Burton) also has struck out this time with a generic, forgettable 
music score.</P>
<P>With a film headed by talented performers Anthony Hopkins and Cuba 
Gooding Jr., you are ultimately led to believe that there will be at 
least some source of worthwhile material. Not this time. "Instinct" is a 
consistently dull, meandering motion picture that is never anything more 
than difficult to sit through and cannot be salvaged by the relatively 
unextraordinary performances of Gooding Jr. and Hopkins. About 25% of 
the audience I was with got up and left even before the end credits 
appeared. They had the right idea.</P>
