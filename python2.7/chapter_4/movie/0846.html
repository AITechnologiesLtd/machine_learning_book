<PRE>                             THE ICICLE THIEF
                       A film review by Jim Pellmann
                        Copyright 1990 Jim Pellmann</PRE>
<P>     One of the most entertaining and imaginative movies I've seen in a
quite a while.  This is an Italian comedy which slickly combines a spoof
of television with an homage to the 1949 classic Italian movie THE
BICYCLE THIEF.</P>
<P>There are several stories intertwined:</P>
<P>1) The story of a film director (played by Maurizio Nichetti, who also
wrote
   and directed) whose dramatic film called "The Icicle Thief" is being
shown
   on television.  The film starts out as he arrives at the TV studio to
be
   interviewed by a pompous film critic before the film is to be shown.
The
   behind-the-scenes antics at the studio are almost slapstick.  </P>
<P>2) As the movie starts to be shown on the TV station, we switch to it
and
   watch the beginning of what seems to be a typical Italian post-World
War II
   tear-jerker about a man (also played by Nichetti) who can't find a
job, his
   starstruck wife, their small son who has to work in a gas station to
   help support the family, and a baby who's constantly ignored while he
   narrowly avoids one disaster after another (a running gag throughout
the
   movie).</P>
<PRE>3) We also see a bickering family at home watching TV as the movie comes
on.
   The very pregnant mother watches the movie and gives running
commentary
   on it to her husband (also played by Nichetti) who tries to ignore
her,
   and to her son who is slowly building a megalopolis out of Lego
blocks 
   (another running gag).</PRE>
<P>     At the most melodramatic points in the story, the movie is
interrupted for some inane (but hilarious) commercials.  As the director
gets more and more outraged at the way the TV station is destroying his
masterwork, the commercials seem to come even faster.  </P>
<P>     We switch back and forth between the movie, the commercials, the
studio, and the living room, and before we know it, the characters from
the commercials start interacting with the characters from the movie.
It doesn't take long until the characters in the movie are dealing with
all new problems introduced by the commercial, and vice versa.  The
director, watches in horror as a whole new plot unfolds before his eyes,
and before long, he too enters the action of the movie to try to get it
back on course.</P>
<P>     This is a movie made with intelligence, care, and wit.  There are
many clever touches and special effects as the characters interact.  Pay
attention to all the details or you'll miss some of the gags.  If you're
sick of gangster movies, check this out.  Highest recommendation.</P>
<P>Postscript:  After this movie played in Italy, the government passed a
law limiting the number of commercial interruptions in movies broadcast
on TV!</P>
