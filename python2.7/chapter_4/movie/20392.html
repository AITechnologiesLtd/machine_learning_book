<P>Susan Granger's review of "THE CHILL FACTOR" (Warner Brothers)</P>
<P>          In this wannabe action-thriller, the mid-August tranquillity
of a tiny tropical atoll in the South Pacific is shattered when a
covert scientific military research operation, code name "Elvis," goes
terribly wrong. As a result, only the scientist who invented the
formula and a disgraced Army officer remain alive. Skip ahead ten
years to a hot summer day in the tiny town of Jerome, Montana, where
two young men - Cuba Gooding Jr. (Oscar winner for "Jerry Maguire")
and Skeet Ulrich - are in the wrong place at the wrong time. When the
guilt-stricken scientist (David Paymer) is murdered by the villainous
Major (Peter Firth), these two hapless guys must transport the toxic
and potentially combustible chemical weapon and safely deliver it to
Fort Magruder, 90 miles away. Only, they have to keep it frozen, and
the only refrigerated vehicle available is Gooding's ice-cream
truck. Of course, the Major's tactical team is in hot pursuit of
"Elvis on ice." Kind of reminds you of the concept "Speed," doesn't
it? Plus a French thriller called "Wages of Fear" with much the same
plotline. The profanity-laden screenplay by Drew Gitlin and Mike Cheda
is dumb and derivative, and novice Hugh Johnson's directing is
by-the-numbers, relying on violent hand-to-hand combat, macho gunplay,
and loud explosions. And how is it that everyone seems to know
everyone else's cell-phone number when I can't even remember my own?
On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Chill Factor" is a
numbingly stupid 3. It's toxic, all right.</P>
