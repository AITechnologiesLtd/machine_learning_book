<PRE>"The Beach" -- Paradise Lost
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>"The Beach" is a structurally confusing film that I
can only describe has having multiple personality
disorder.  Every forty minutes of this two-hour film
begins with a new theme, virtually discarding what has
been set up in the preceding act.  It starts off
purposefully as a film about an innocent man seeking
new thrills in a dangerous environment.  But then in
the second act, the mood of the film abruptly changes
and it becomes a story about a love triangle on an
idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of "Blue
Lagoon".  Forty minutes later, the mood changes once
more, and it becomes a dumbed down version of "Lord of
the Flies" where an isolated community is discovered,
where their moral code touts maintaining a sense of
bliss at all costs.  By the time it's over, you can
only scratch your head and wonder what this film was
really meant to be about.  </P>
<P>The main character of "The Beach" is angst-ridden
Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio).  He travels to the
Netherworld of Bangkok where back alley merchants push
their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily
clad women brazenly ask if you're looking for a good
time.  Richard's voice-over tells the audience that he
has come to this place because he is bored with his
life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is
to let go of the familiar and to enter into a world of
the unknown.</P>
<P>This seedy environment is just what Richard is looking
for.  He checks into a fleabag hotel where he meets
the crazed Daffy (Robert Carlisle).  He seems like a
raving lunatic, obviously high from heavy drug use and
looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of
psychosis.  Though his jagged behavior would distress
most of us, Richard listens to him as he speaks of a
mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach
that anyone has ever seen.  Moreover, the island
itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can
make a small city high for life.  Captivated by the
idea, he asks two other hotel guests to join him on
his journey. They are worldly Etienne and the alluring
Francoise, who have also come to Thailand for reasons
similar to Richard's.  </P>
<P>Once they finally arrive at this paradise, however,
the mood of the story shifts to Richard's growing
desire for Francoise.  This particular plot point is
weak at best because there is absolutely no question
in my mind that Francoise will wind up with Richard. 
Etienne is about as exciting as fluffy, white sand. 
It's odd that Etienne never sees this coming, but
paradise has a way of hiding potential threats just
out of view.  And once the three stumble across the
hidden community (mood shift imminent), more events
transpire that depict its hidden dangers.  For
example, there are marijuana fields close by patrolled
by armed guards.  And the lagoon in which they swim
invites the occasional shark.</P>
<P>There are several ideas that are introduced in "The
Beach" and each one could merit its own feature-length
film.  There's the man vs. nature angle, the love
triangle angle, and the Utopia-gone-awry angle.  But
the film meanders so tremendously that its entire
purpose becomes blurred.  DiCaprio, as a result, has
an almost impossible time of trying to embody the
different states of mind that he and the film goes
through.  Consequently, the audience has an equally
difficult time trying to keep up.</P>
