<PRE>STARSHIP TROOPERS (1997)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Paul Verhoeven
Writer: Edward Neumeier (based on the novel by Robert A. Heinlein)
Starring: Casper Van Dien, Dina Meyer, Denise Richards, Neil Patrick
Harris, Patrick Muldoon, Jake Busey, Michael Ironside, Clancy Brown,
Seth Gilliam, Marshall Bell, Rue McClanahan</P>
<P>Sure, "Starship Troopers" is no "Star Wars," but it has enough fun-ass
gore, cool futuristic satire, and hysterically bad 90210-esque melodrama
to keep me interested and satisfied for the full time.  I mean, sure
it's jam-packed with stupidity, gratuitous nudity, and zero
characterization, but it's a sci-fi gorefest, and a fun one at that.</P>
<P>As the trailers have been saying for almost a year, "Starship Troopers"
deals with a bunch of futuristic marines who go across the universe to
battle a bunch of evil, deadly, giant bugs on their rocky home planet,
armed with little but a couple detonators, and machine guns, as well as
a couple nukes, just in case.  And yes, there's some attempts at
creating memorable characters, most who are slaughtered mercilessly by
the razor-sharp legged bugs, and yeah, that fails pitifully, but the
whole bit with the bugs, which takes up most of the last half of the
film, is what we came to see, and the film knows it.</P>
<P>The film brings us a bunch of pretty Spelling-ites...and Neil Patrick
Harris (who's the biggest name in the no-name cast), who interact with
one another during the film.  The protagonist is Johnny Rico (Casper Van
Dien), who is dating the hot Carmen (Denise Richards), who is crazy over
him, but soon falls for the hunky Zander (Patrick Muldoon, from "Melrose
Place"), who are both going to be pilots in the army.  Of course, she
still loves Johnny, but she can never see him, even if he joins the army
to be sorta near her.  Soon Johnny finds that the chick from high school
who had a crush on him, Diz (Dina Meyer), looks more attractive than she
used to.</P>
<P>This all takes place in the far future, a fascist world of pure high
tech-ness, where we hear about televised executions, public beatings,
and about obtaining citizenship.  The film presents some of it in the
fashion of a Riefenstahl-esque bit of propoganda that goes on throughout
the film, showing people working hard, and glorifying the deadly
marines, even when they're being torn limb by limb by the bugs.  This
satire is one of the saving graces of the film.</P>
<P>For the first hour, we get the aforementioned melodrama, as well as the
whole spiel of boot camp, where the drill sergeant (Clancy Brown, who
obviosuly took notes from R. Lee Ermey about how to act like one) trains
them in horribly nasty training, sometimes even wounding them (he breaks
a guy's arm, and throws a dagger into another's hand).  These aren't
great, but they're cool to watch.</P>
<P>The big part which we were all waiting for comes at about the halfway
part, and is hardly disappointing.  The first time we see the bugs is
cool, and we are predictably slaughtered mercilessly by them, as it
takes about 5 guys shooting them for about a minute to take just one
down.  And yes, we use machine guns on them instead of just nuking the
shit out of them, although we do that once, only killing the ones on the
surface, since they live underground.</P>
<P>Oh, and I suppose you're all wondering where Mr. Doogie Howser M.D.
himself is included here?  Well, Neil plays none other than a psychic
scientist/classmate of Johnny, Carmen, and Diz, who basically becomes a
big power in the army.  Yeah, I know, it's stupid, but it's so weird
that it's campy.  Oh, and look for ex-"Golden Girl" Rue McClanahan as a
biology teacher.</P>
<P>There's not a lot of humanity in the characters, and even scenes where a
well-known character is killed isn't as moving as it should be.  Sure
when one of the four leads was killed, I was moved, but most people are
just sent to war just to get killed, which kind of works as satire in a
way, I suppose.</P>
<P>The real star of the film is the special effects, which are brilliant,
man.  Of course, this is from Paul Verhoeven, who is a genius with
special effects that look realistic ("Total Recall" won an Oscar for
them), and the ones in this look absolutely realistic.  The bugs
interact perfectly with the actors on the screen, creating a sense of
realism.  They become scarier just because they look so realistic, and
when they attack a human, it looks just as realistic.  My personal
favorite use of this is when the giant base is surrounded by a literal
sea of bugs.</P>
<P>The charm of "Starship Troopers" is that it's just plain fun and it
knows it.  Director Paul Verhoeven is just trying to bring an
entertaining piece of brain candy to the big screen, complete with
hundreds of little guilty pleasures.  I mean, the shower sequence where
we men and women bathing together is one of the funniest things I've
ever seen.  And the huge amount of gore (people being chomped in half,
appendages laying around everywhere, etc, etc, etc) is just awesome. 
And how he pays homages to everything from Riefenstahl's "Triumph of the
Will" to his earlier "Total Recall" is awesome (Verhoeven staple Michael
Ironside plays a one-armed general or sergeant or something, and he lost
both his arms in "Total Recall").</P>
<P>There's a kind of campy fun to watching all these Spelling-ites sent to
a far and away place to be slaughtered that satisfies something in
ourselves.  And even while "Starship Troopers" might be about as dumb as
Forrest Gump himself, or not even follow the novel very well (I never
read it anyway), it's still a bitching time at the movies.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***</PRE>
