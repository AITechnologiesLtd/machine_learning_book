<PRE>THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA (1954)</PRE>
<P>"You are not a woman.  You will not allow yourself to be loved, and 
you cannot love."</P>
<PRE>4 out of ****</PRE>
<P>Starring Ava Gardner, Humphrey Bogart, Edmond O'Brien
Written & Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz
Cinematography by Jack Cardiff</P>
<P>The trajectory of THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA is so relentless that it 
doesn't even bother with the pretense of suspense.  It is a story of 
rags-to-riches, riches-to-tragedy, and the tragedy is such a foregone 
conclusion that the movie begins with the end--the funeral of Maria, 
the Barefoot Contessa, a young woman who became a world-famous movie 
star overnight, but remained unhappy, unfulfilled, and died several 
years and three movies later.  The movie is not very interested in how 
Maria becomes a star--that story has been told before.  It is 
interested in the consequences, and while that story has also been 
told before, it has rarely been told with such style and with such 
tragic grandeur.</P>
<P>Humphrey Bogart, playing the aging director who gives Maria her big 
break, is billed as the star, but the movie is Ava Gardner's.  She 
plays Maria--she is Maria--and her classical, sculptured beauty is 
just right for this role, where she plays a woman whose talent and 
looks are more curse than blessing, because they put her on a pedestal 
where no one else can reach her.</P>
<P>Maria is a dancer in a bar in Madrid when we first meet her.  A rich 
Hollywood producer and his PR man, Oscar (Edmond O'Brien, who won an 
Oscar for the role), try to lure her to America with the usual 
blandishments.  She dismisses them, but Bogart's Harry Dawes--a 
"washed-up ex-drunk"--is able to reach her, and so she comes to 
America, and she becomes a star.</P>
<P>We never see a single scene from Maria's films, nor do we see her on 
the set.  What we see is her off-screen life.  She is not a typical 
star.  She doesn't have a lover; she doesn't even attend the opening 
of her first movie with an escort.  Hell, she doesn't even smoke--now 
what kind of behaviour is that for a famous actress?  And she is not 
happy.  She still feels like the vulnerable little girl she used to 
be, Cinderella waiting for her Prince Charming to come along, to love 
her and make her feel safe.  She does not allow herself to be loved by 
anyone, waiting for this fairytale lover.</P>
<P>While another movie might treat Maria as a cold bitch who doesn't 
know what's good for her, THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA is much wiser.  It is 
fundamentally sympathetic to Maria's point of view: Mankiewicz, as he 
did in ALL ABOUT EVE, subtly and poignantly probes the dilemma of 
women in the entertainment business, when men have all the money, when 
beauty is the sole measure of stardom and, of course, it doesn't last 
forever.</P>
<P>But, as with ALL ABOUT EVE, the best thing about THE BAREFOOT 
CONTESSA is Mankiewicz's dialogue.  He has an amazing talent for 
wicked, pointed exchanges; he writes dialogue that is stilted, 
melodramatic, unrealistic--and a sheer joy to listen to.  There is one 
monologue by Oscar, describing the guests at a French Riviera party, 
which in its sophistication, its wordplay, its incisive sarcasm, is as 
verbally rich as poetry.</P>
<P>The film is beautifully structured, too.  Mankiewicz uses the funeral 
as his frame device, and the camera shifts back and forth between 
several mourners, revealing Maria through their memories--through the 
eyes of Harry Dawes, and then Oscar, and then Maria's Prince Charming, 
an Italian Count who is the last of his line.  Maria goes to live with 
him in Italy, with his barren sister, in their dark mansion with vague 
House of Usher undertones.  They marry, with tragic consequences, 
witnessed through Bogart's eyes, and the film comes full circle.  It 
is as balanced and precise and perfect as haiku.</P>
<P>The movie is just as sophisticated on an emotional level, especially 
in the way it handles the relationship between Bogart and Gardner.  He 
is many things to her: friend, confessor, part-time amateur therapist, 
father figure, but never her lover.  There is a suggestion that Harry 
is really the Prince Charming that Maria is looking for, but his 
heart belongs to another woman, and so they remain friends.  The 
emotions involved in their relationship are complex and adult, not the 
clichés of formula fiction.  There is a scene in which Maria and Harry 
talk at a party, and she tells him why she is so unhappy, and her 
words may be melodramatic, but as Harry himself observes, "there's 
more to talking than just words," and there is more to her speech than 
superficial emotions--there is clarity and comprehension.  It's easy 
enough to show a beautiful actress whose life is ruined by show 
business; it's a lot harder to understand that actress, to get under 
her skin, to know her, but this movie does just that.  The Contessa is 
placed on a pedestal where no one can reach her--no one except the 
viewer.</P>
