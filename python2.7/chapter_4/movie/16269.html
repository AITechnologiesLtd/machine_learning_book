<P>    If you were seriously ill, there are two physicians you'd do
well to avoid: Patch Adams and Agaki Fuu.  Yet the two
doctors introduced to the movie public in 1998--the first by
director Tom Shadyac, the latter by the great Shohei
Imamura--are both treated as heroes.  And they are indeed, if
you discount their ability to heal.  In "Patch Adams,"
considered by one critic to be the most vulgarly sentimental
film by a major Hollywood studio since "Love Story" was
offered in 1970, not one foot of film displayed the title
character's actually treating an illness.  "Dr. Akagi," by
contrast, is brimming with shots of injections, incisions, and
research with a microscope, but because its title figure
administers to his patients as though they all had hepatitis,
he is not likely to cure his sufferers--except perhaps
metaphorically.  The American doctor who to this day heads
an institute in Virginia that treats patients at no charge and
the Japanese practitioner whose career spanned the years of
World War II have two things in common: One, they made
people laugh, although Akagi's public rather snickered as he
ran by and called him a quack.  Two, they were more
compassionate, more accepting of human frailty, than the
general population.  Though the characters in the Robin
Williams movie are not explored in any particular depth, those
in the Japanese account are surveyed perceptively.  By doing
this, director Imamura is able to show his audience what it
means to accept humanity in all its measure.</P>
<P>   Dr. Akagi (Akira Emoto) is a physician in a Japanese
seaside community concerned with what he sees as an
epidemic of hepatitis during the final months of World War II. 
He is nicknamed Dr. Liver by those who consider him a
quack.  By many definitions of that term he fits the bill by
misdiagnosing most of his patients' illnesses.  The 72-year
old director, Shohei Imamura (whose father was a doctor), is
far more attentive to Akagi's goodness, his benevolence and
acceptance of the human condition.  Accommodating Ango
Sakaguchi's novel to the screen, Imamura presents Akagi as
a man who literally runs from one emergency appointment to
another, in one case leaping from his office to an island he
had never heard of at the plea of a dying man's frantic
daughter.  His assistants are a motley crew, particularly a
surgeon who is addicted to morphine, Toriumi (Masanori
Sera); a priest with a taste for the bottle, Unemoto (Juro
Kara); an escaped prisoner of war from the Netherlands, Piet
(Jacques Gamblin); and most startling, a hooker whose
mother had groomed her for the profession, Sonoko (Kumiko
Aso).  The dissolute members of his team agree to give up
their vices, but people being what they are, they cannot. 
When Sonoko is asked to stop selling herself altogether, she
replies that she sees men "hardly ever."  For his part Toriumi
swears that his relationship with morphine is that "I hardly
use it anymore."</P>
<P>   Imamura, whose recent works include a story about a
paroled wife-killer whose obsessive relationship to his pet eel
is not wholly explained, is not too concerned with analyzing
the psychological bases of his people's demands.  We do
know that Akagi has intermittent nightmares that his son, a
doctor at the front, is performing dire medical experiments on
live subjects who have been captured by the Japanese army. 
This small clue is, however, the key to an understanding of
the film's metaphor.  Akagi appears distressed by what he
considers his son's immorality and, by extension, the
indecency of the Japanese fighting machine and of war itself. 
Humankind's addiction to conflict is like liver disease: an
epidemic that spreads indiscriminately, a moral sickness
which never goes away.  If Akagi has no cure for hepatitis,
the world has no corrective for war.  While the good doctor
believes in what he considers the Japanese cause--to free
Asia from Western colonialism--he nonetheless fumes at the
runaway nationalism that has led to armed combat.  Toriumi,
the drug addicted surgeon, is more cynical when he states, 
"To hell with Japan's future."</P>
<P>   The prostitute Sonoko is the comic center of the movie. 
Played with great charm and humanity by Kumiko Aso, this
doctor's assistant is not at all skeptical or negative about her
trade.  In her own innocent and untutored way, she loves
men, and deals with her profession as quite the honorable
way to support her sister and brother.  When she has sex
with the son of a woman who begs her to do so because that
young man is going to the front and "virgins attract bullets,"
she can sleep soundly, knowing that she has done yet
another good deed for her nation.  </P>
<P>   Exquisitely acted and photographed with a true feeling for
life in a village largely untouched by Allied bombing, "Dr.
Akagi" happily does not pass moral judgment on the small
people with whom the movie deals but rather condemns the
authoritarian government that has made wholesale slaughter
inevitable.</P>
