<PRE>                                 LAND AND FREEDOM
                       A film review by T. Robin Sutherland
                        Copyright 1995 T. Robin Sutherland</PRE>
<P>     LAND AND FREEDOM is a difficult film to watch, for many reasons.
First and foremost, it is a war film and since Vietnam, war films
have typically been about skewed politics, lost idealism, the vanity of
the glory of war, and pain and death without reward.  This film is not
an exception.</P>
<P>     It is also initially difficult in that it is a film whose
protagonists are from many different countries: they are volunteers and
mercenaries rallied from across the world to fight Franco in the
Spanish Civil War.  This creates a very rich atmosphere for the drama
of the film as one gets used to the sporadic subtitling, outrageous
accents, and lost dialogue which is either too rapid or stilted to be
translated.</P>
<P>     And it is finally a difficult film to appreciate without a fairly
detailed understanding of the elements of the Spanish Civil War.  To
have known that the Poum (the faction to which the main character has
become attached) was actually a Trotskyist splinter group would have
made a significant difference to my viewing.  Many local political
problems constitute the focus of conflict on both regional and personal
levels.</P>
<P>     But war films are supposed to be hard to watch: war is not a
simple thing--it is the essence of politics, and in this spirit, the
film illustrates many themes.  Textbook idealism, for one, does not
translate well in the battlefield.  What you believe you are fighting
for may be utterly at odds with the politics of your group (despite
their propaganda).  Relationships which are sound and strong may be
lost in a moment over a political detail.  Loyalty wears many
uniforms.  Most of the fighting is not in the trenches.  And, of
course, people die for no comprehensible reason.  All of these points
are made strongly and specifically enough to make you regard them as
more than the cliches of war--they are experiences of each fighter, and
you must see each in its own context.</P>
<P>     This film is beautifully shot.  Most of it is (necessarily)
presented in picturesque outdoor locations which contrast with the
brutality of its action.  Two sequences attract particular attention.
One somewhat overlong sequence outlines the local political infighting
which takes place when the Poum tries to decide to collectivize a
captured estate.  Here it would have been interesting to contrast the
local politics of the Poum against their "official" political line, but
the confusion is indicative of the splintering which causes the
freedom-fighting factions to actually fire on each other later on.  A
second sequence involves the capture of an enemy position--the action
sequence is frantically paced and artfully executed, and creates a
novel build to the film's actual climax.</P>
<P>     Ian Hart has no difficulty in his role as the misplaced man from
Liverpool whose ideals exceed his understanding.  His frustration is as
thick as his loyalty to the principles for which he left his home.  His
character is incredibly honest, and places the common man's plight to
preserve freedom and decency in the world squarely in the swamp of
world politics.  He is easy to identify with, despite his obvious
distance from the audience's context, and it is impossible not to
sympathize with him without being deeply cynical.</P>
<P>     This was not a profound movie for me, but it was an engaging,
educating, and at times, genuinely entertaining film.  I would
recommend it, not as an art film, nor as popular fare, but perhaps as a
film which may provide an honest look at a sparsely filmed bit of
history, presented plausibly from an outsider's point of view.</P>
