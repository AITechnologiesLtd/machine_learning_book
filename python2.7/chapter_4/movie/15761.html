<P>   Perhaps the most dramatic story in all of the Bible is found
in Exodos, what with plagues and bugs, pestilence and
floods, a burning bush, and a snake emerging from a rod. 
There's the parting of the Red Sea, the blood clot of the Nile,
the voice of the Creator (not to be confused with "The
Truman Show") and, golly, after all this, who could doubt that
a man could walk on water?  Only a major film studio could
one-up all this, and which company (save Disney) could do
the job better than DreamWorks, whose contribution so far
this year must give many a kid second thoughts before
stepping on a hill of ants?  DreamWorks goes the Creator a
few steps further.  Not only do the hundreds of people who
had been involved with the construction of "The Lion King"
duplicate the vast miracles of the Old Testament's second
book: they have the Egyptian hieroglyphics, already one of
the world's marvels, come to life and bounce around while
the animators pay homage to the ancient protocol of keeping
the figures sideways.</P>
<P>   With a bevy of original songs penned by Stephen
Schwartz--who avoids the Andrew Lloyd Webber conventions
to inject faintly Hebraic melodies--the cast of thousands act
out the themes of the lyrics: everything from the suffering of
the slaves to the prejudices of one people toward another,
without ignoring the heroics of the title character who trusts in
God though faced with possible death.  These themes give
the film its contemporary relevance, but of course a
correspondence between art and life is only the beginning of
what makes a grand movie.  "The Prince of Egypt" is
imposing because it pushes the animation into a whole new
look, one which deals credibly and even thrillingly
with human beings engaged in an epic struggle without the
crutch of cute animals by their side and nary a trace of
extraneous and contrived comic relief. </P>
<P>   The voices of major performers in the U.S. and Britain are
so robust and convincing that we wish only that they could
make a regular movie with the force of this eloquent
animation.  The story of Exodus is embellished by dramatic
effect but, as the filmmakers state, the emotional truths are
retained.  </P>
<P>   In a widescreen shot that borrows from the Great Man
Cecil B. DeMille himself, downtrodden slaves are constructing
the pyramids under the whips of the Pharoah's overseers. 
How that ancient civilization was able to build such structures
is not as mystifying as we thought, given the thousands
toiling away, dragging stones and hauling them to huge
heights, the skyscrapers of their day.  Because Egyptians
were killing Hebrew infants, Moses (Val Kilmer) is floated
down the Nile in a covered basket, rescued by the Egyptian
queen (Helen Mirren) and promised safe haven, where he is
raised as though he were the brother of the crown prince,
Rameses (Ralph Fiennes).  The adolescent friendship
between Rameses and Moses--who had every reason to
believe he was a member of the royal Egyptian family--should
please many a teen today.  Then as now the young men got
their kicks from risky adventures: in Moses' day the two
"brothers" raced around town in chariots, not shying away
from bumping each other like the drivers of the scooter cars
in Coney Island.  </P>
<P>   Moses ultimately learns from his real brother Aaron (Jeff
Goldblum) and sister Miriam (Sandra Bullock) that he is one
of the Hebrew people and not, as he had thought, an
Egyptian prince.  Doubting and resisting, Moses is convinced
upon hearing the voice from the Burning Bush, "I am that I
am, the God of your fathers."</P>
<P>   When Moses agrees to chuck his regal prerogatives and
fight for his people, all hell breaks loose on the Egyptians. 
Rameses, who has now become Pharaoh, soon tires of his
"brother"'s pleas to free the Hebrew slaves, but when he
refuses to let the oppressed people go, his kingdom turns
into a modern Baghdad of woes, only far worse.  And here is
where the animators are turned loose.  In a series of
vehement and bloody scenes, some worthy of a Stephen
King drama worked over by John Carpenter, a foggy
presence seeps through the homes of all Egyptians, killing
the first-born in each case while passing over the homes of
the Hebrews (which have been marked by the blood of a
lamb).  Bugs crawl out of bread, ants cover the bodies of the
overlords, fire drizzles from the heavens, and large insects
descend like locusts from "The Good Earth."  As Pharoah--
whose promises are as reliable as Saddam's--permits the
Hebrews to leave, his soldiers attack.  Moses and his
followers sweep across the Red Sea, which has parted
miraculously and which closes upon the armies of the
Egyptian soldiers.  Safely on shore, Moses ultimately
receives the 10 Commandments and is shown holding the
tablet aloft as thousands of his grateful adherents gaze in
wonder.</P>
<P>   If the makers of this extraordinary film have you seeing the
Bible's most dramatic story through fresh eyes, credit the
vision of the DreamWorks team.  Eschewing the literal and
using the story as a jumping off point, they have turned an
already moving and universal written tale into cinematic
poetry.</P>
<P>   Just before the film began, the theater showed what is the
most creative little histories of film, using muppets to explain
the century's old story of celluloid from the beginning.  First
there was neither sound nor visuals--not very exciting.  Then
came visuals but no sound. Soon microphones were added
and we entered the world of talkies, followed by color, wide-
screen and special effects.  What they might have added was
that "The Prince of Egypt" is another historic breakdown, not
as momentous a jump as the others, but nonetheless the first
time an exciting, full-length animation utilizing both computer
techniques and traditional procedures gloriously transcends
the boundary between youthful fare and adult entertainment.</P>
