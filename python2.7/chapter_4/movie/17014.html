<P>Let's get the basics out of the way. "Analyze This" is a very funny film. 
The raucous tale of a New York mob boss seeking therapy from a reluctant 
psychiatrist contains a number of mistakes (I'll carp about those in a 
minute), but still delivers big laughs on a consistent basis. Robert De 
Niro is wonderful, taking his classic gangster persona and giving it just 
enough of a twist to make the humor work. As for Billy Crystal, this film 
marks the first time in several years where I didn't have an overwhelming 
desire to climb into the screen and strangle him. For me, that's saying a 
lot.  </P>
<P>You see, Billy Crystal owes me, for stealing precious hours from my life 
with crap like "Forget Paris," "City Slickers 2," "Fathers' Day" and last 
year's wretched "My Giant," not to mention the numerous times he tortured 
me while hosting the Academy Awards, parroting a seemingly endless stream 
of tired Borscht-belt gags while smirking as if he'd just invented the 
fucking wheel (pardon the crudeness - - I'm simply trying to get you in 
right mood for the obscenity-laced movie). Thankfully, Crystal tones it 
down here. By the time, late in the story, where he finally does break 
into shtick, it's relatively easy to tolerate.</P>
<P>"Analyze This" brings together two wildly separate subcultures when 
mobster Paul Vitti (De Niro) enters the life of psychiatrist Ben Sobol 
(Crystal). Suffering from frequent panic attacks and crying jags, a real 
hindrance to an underworld kingpin, Vitti demands the full attention of 
Sobol, and if that means interrupting the therapist's wedding or sending 
a thug into the shrink's bedroom, so be it.</P>
<P>The production was directed and co-written by Harold Ramis (best known as 
the freakiest member of the "Ghostbusters"), a man with a real gift for 
crowd-pleasing comedies, including "Meatballs," "Caddyshack" and the 
bittersweet "Stuart Saves His Family." At his best, as in "Groundhog Day,
" Ramis can inject a nice message into a high-concept premise without 
diluting the comedy. At his worst ("Multiplicity"), he takes one joke and 
beats it to death.</P>
<P>"Analyze This" is one of his better efforts. Eschewing any messages or 
morals, Ramis simply goes for the laughs this time around and, for the 
most part, gets them. De Niro, parodying his many mob roles, plays a 
great steamroller of a man, trying to maintain his gangland machismo even 
while his emotions run rampant. De Niro takes risks with his performance. 
He doesn't just bawl, he blubbers, and his early crying jags come 
perilously close to overacting. But later, even while making the same 
ludicrous wailing noises, the great actor uses subtle changes in 
expression to effectively convey the genuine pain his character is 
feeling. A great deal of the humor comes from his awkward efforts to 
cooperate with the therapeutic process. In one scene, he acknowledges 
that he had considered rubbing out a key character, then helpfully adds 
"but I was feeling very conflicted about it." </P>
<P>Had Ramis dug a little deeper, the comedy would have been more resonant. 
Even with suitable henchman (including a great turn from Joe Viterelli as 
Vitti's thick, lumbering sidekick), Ramis' portrayal of the mobsters is 
too superficial. Chazz Palminteri, playing Vitti's arch rival, is little 
more than a cardboard cut-out. </P>
<P>The characters on Crystal's side don't fare much better. Lisa Kudrow, who 
gets better with each film, is given scant screen time (she makes every 
line count though, including one where she deliciously sneers "Oh great, 
my wedding is ruined because you have problems!"). Subplots involving her 
menacing father, as well as Crystal's dad, a neglectful pop psychology 
writer, are introduced but never revisited. And the genuinely sweet 
relationship between Crystal and his son deserves far more attention than 
it is given.</P>
<P>The film's biggest liability, though, is its timing. Just weeks ago, HBO 
introduced "The Sopranos," a brilliant new series about modern-day 
mobsters prominently featuring scenes between a crime-lord and his 
therapist. The show covers the same turf as "Analyze This," including the 
gallows humor, but with far greater depth, richness and elan. So my 
recommendation is as follows: enjoy "Analyze This" for what it is, then 
turn on "The Sopranos" and savor a great show exploring similar themes 
with far more success and, thank God, without Billy Crystal.</P>
