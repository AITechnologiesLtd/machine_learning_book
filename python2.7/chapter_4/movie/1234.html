<PRE>                                 GRAND CANYON
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1992 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  GRAND CANYON is an iridescent film.  It
     looks entirely different from different angles.  As with a
     Picasso, each person must find his/her own interpretation.
     Don't believe anyone else as to what the film is about.
     Rating: high +1 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     You made a mistake.  Because of your mistake you are about to die.
Your loved ones will have to get along without you because they have seen
you alive for the last time.  You have just lost what would have been the
rest of your life.  Then a perfect stranger reaches out a hand and saves
your life.  It is just a tiny action, but it means you are back again in the
world of the living.  You are going to have that rest-of-your-life after
all.  Do you see the world any differently now?  Darn right you do!  Every
good thing that happens to you--and every bad thing--is a gift of the
stranger.  Now the whole world looks surreal.  You are much more aware of
the happy and unhappy events that make up the life you almost lost.  You
suddenly have a sense of wonder about incidents you might never have thought
about the day before.  That is at least one way to look at Lawrence Kasdan's
enigmatic GRAND CANYON.  My wife sat on my right and claimed to have seen a
film making a philosophical point about what comes of good intentions.  A
friend who sat on my left (even slopping over into my seat) saw a film
intended to make a strong but not overly familiar political point that our
cities are deteriorating beyond the point of repair.  These are remarkably
different interpretations of a single film.  Perhaps the greatest virtue of
GRAND CANYON is its strange ambiguity.</P>
<P>     Mack (played by Kevin Kline) is on his way home from a basketball game
in urban Los Angeles when his car breaks down in just the wrong
neighborhood.  He calls for a tow truck but has the feeling he may not see
it come.  Sure enough, five youths with obviously bad intentions are about
to attack him when the tow truck driver, Simon (played by Danny Glover),
arrives and diplomatically defuses the situation.  Mack is so grateful to
Simon he feels he wants to help improve Simon's life.  Then an unrelated
"miraculous" event happens to Mack's wife Claire (played by Mary McDonnell
of DANCES WITH WOLVES and MATEWAN).  Soon events are intertwining the lives
of these three people, Mack's secretary Dee (played by Mary-Louise Parker of
LONGTIME COMPANION and FRIED GREEN TOMATOES), Dee's friend Jane (played by
Alfre Woodard, who played Winnie Mandela to Glover's Nelson Mandela in--what
else?--MANDELA), and Mack's best friend Davis (played by Steve Martin).</P>
<P>     Lawrence Kasdan co-produced, directed, and co-authored the screenplay
with his wife.  Together, the Kasdans create a story of rapture and
disaster.  It is a story of mysticism and self-reliance.  It is about good
luck and bad luck, yet it never becomes soap opera.  It is always
captivating, yet it is never clear where it is coming from.  When the film
ends, you sit watching the credits asking, "Well, what was that about?"  I
give it a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.  (P.S.  Checking the VARIETY
review, I find out that *they* think it is a film about survival strategies
in L.A.)</P>
