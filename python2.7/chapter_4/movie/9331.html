"There's something rotten in the state of Denmark": Hamlet, Kenneth
Branagh, and Kenneth Branagh's Ego</PRE>
<P>Hamlet (USA, 1996, 237min59s), based on William Shakespeare's play,
adapted for the screen and directed by Kenneth Branagh, filmed in 65mm on
location at Blenheim Castle and at Shepperton Studios</P>
<P>with Kenneth Branagh, Julie Christie, Derek Jacobi, Richard Briers,
Michael Maloney, Nicholas Farrell, Kate Winslet, Charlton Heston, Billy
Crystal, Gerard Depardieu, Robin Williams, Jack Lemmon, John Mills and
John Gielgud.</P>
<P>A long time ago, in another movie era, Laurence Olivier directed his
version of the Bard's turn-of-the-seventeenth-century play, and the
critics then blamed him for being too old for the part and, most of all,
for restructuring (a polite word for "butchering") the play. What Branagh
presents in 1996 is -- for the first time ever -- the play uncut, albeit
transposed into Denmark's nineteenth century.</P>
<P>These four hours with Denmark's Royals are completely worthwhile. For the
third time this year, adapting a 400 year-old play has led to fascinating
results: Al Pacino's Looking For Richard was personnal and brilliant, and
Baz Luhrman's Romeo And Juliet colorful and deeply energetic. Respecting
the author (John Gielgud is part of the cast), Branagh gives this time a
more epic grandeur to the play (he even hired Charlton Heston!).</P>
<P>This is probably the most famous story in the English language, I'm sure
everyone has heard of it. It focuses on the young prince of Denmark, who,
mourning the death of his father, encounters his ghost, who informs him he
was poisoned by his brother Claudius, who's just married the widow Gertrude.</P>
<P>The film is technically breathtaking: Alex Thompson's cinematography
masterfully exploits the depth of the 65mm format, and the production
design is one of the most beautiful in years. Yet the strength of
Branagh's cinema resides in its actors: filming in long unbroken takes, he
gives them the opportunity to deliver great performances.
Lucky boy! Who could possibly dream of a more suitable cast? Mixing old
Shakespearian pros with relative newcomers and Hollywood stars provides a
terrific result. I was particularly impressed by Julie Christie (a natural
born actress) and Derek Jacobi (who directed a younger Branagh as Hamlet
on the stage). Her Gertrude rejects her premature remarriage, and his
Claudius is not the villain into which other adaptations turned him -- we
feel he might do as well as King as his predecessor. Branagh's performance
as Hamlet is very good, though monotonous. The long-awaited "To be or not
to be" monologue being filmed in a mirror, the character hesitating to
act: that's an easy trick to show the duality of the man!
This is however little, when compared with other manifestations of
Branagh's ego. In Much Ado About Nothing, he showed himself walking on
water; in the current film, the end has him being carried away after the
duel with his arms outstretched in a not oversubtle allusion to Jesus
being taken from the cross. I can think of only one person whose ego is
possibly as big as his: the other half of Britain's most celebrated
ex--movie-couple, Ms. Emma Thompson herself...(see Sense And Sensibility)</P>
