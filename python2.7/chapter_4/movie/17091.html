<PRE>Life Is Beautiful.</PRE>
<P>Starring Roberto Benigni and Nicoletta Braschi
Directed By Roberto Benigni
Running Time: 1 hour 54 minutes.</P>
<PRE>(Miramax)</PRE>
<P>Only the Italians could create a love story set against the holocaust, and
make it as wonderful and enjoyable as this. Benigni plays Guido, a Jewish
bookstore owner who falls in love with Dora (Braschi.) However, this is
during the period of Nazi Germany, and Guido, Dora, their son Giosue
(Giorgio Cantarini) and Uncle (Giustino Durano) end up at a concentration
camp. We follow their adventures there, as Benigni turns the camp into a
'game' to Giosue, an he tries to reunite himself with his wife.</P>
<P>This film is truly great. Benigni gives a performance with a childlike spark
that is so perfect and uplifting it puts a big smile on your face. From the
jaunty comedy start to the heart breaking end, Benigni is full of warmth,
charm and appeal. Having also written the screenplay himself, I imagine he
performed the character just the way he wanted it, and it is perfect.
Braschi isn't quite as strong as his wife, but she is still memorable, even
if she does pale to the complete charm and energy of Benigni. Cantarini is
an absolute delight, a wonderfully talented young actor who deserves to go
on to much better things. He also gets an hugely up lifting scene at the end
which has to be to be believed and cherished.</P>
<P>The screenplay is great, if a little underwhelming at first. This is mainly
because the first hour or so is a big set up for the main plot. Consisting
of little romantic vignettes, it's still a comic delight, and the change of
tone from whimsical romance to the horrors of the holocaust is so well
handled by Benigni, it's seamless. In fact, you could almost forget it's set
against the holocaust, if the film was not to remind you of all the horrors,
such as the gas chamber. But the film has a bubbly charm that nearly offsets
this. It may feel strange laughing through the holocaust, but Benigni sure
makes it feel good.</P>
<P>It's impossible to describe how enjoyable this film is. I could write
paragraphs about how the energetic writing, directing, acting and even minor
details such as the music and production design make this film a delight,
but it wouldn't do the film justice. Benigni knows exactly what makes the
audience tick, and exploits us completely. It's never too schmaltzy, it's
never too depressing, it's just the right mix of whimsy and horror. The
greatest achievement is that Benigni has created such as uplifting film
about one of the scariest atrocities of the decade. Witty, surprising, fast
paced and a triumph, Life is Beautiful is an instant classic. Do not miss
out.</P>
