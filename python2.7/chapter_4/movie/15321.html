<P>   "Bonnie and Clyde" meets "Kids" in Larry Clark's second
tension-filled work which, like his widely acclaimed "Kids"
seems so realistic that it's almost cinema verite.  Clark
presents violence as it actually is: sudden, hard-hitting, brutal,
vicious.  There's nothing stylized about its ferocity and save
for one slo-mo scene of a teenage hoodlum entering the site
of a major heist, the whole account builds up steam almost
without letup.  "Another Day in Paradise," a title which is, of
course, ironic, features the inimitable James Woods as (what
else?) an off-the-wall, live-for-the-moment desperado who
seems to bask in the glories of living on the edge despite his
frequent roof-pounding, gut-wrenching expressions of
grievance.  This time around, instead of chasing vampires,
he pursues money and jewels and though he says "sorry"
before shooting one of his victims in the head, he appears to
have been born without the slightest appreciation of guilt.  </P>
<P>   As the charismatic "Uncle" Mel, though, he is not without
charm, a lighter side, a motormouth who takes a couple of
kids half his age under his wing and acts as mentor to them. 
"Another Day in Paradise" pairs James Woods with Melanie
Griffith, the latter in the role of his stylish, maternal girl friend
who is unable to have kids of her own and who assumes a
motherly role toward two youngsters who come into her life;
Bobbie (Vincent Kartheiser) and Rosie (Natasha Gregson
Wagner).</P>
<P>   The movie is a natural for director Clark who published the
book "Tulsa" in 1971, a tome made up of photos he took of
himself and some outlaw friends between the years 1962
and 1971.  After publishing four books and holding 50 one-
person exhibits at galleries like the Museum of Modern Art
and the Whitney, Clark directed the instant classic, "Kids" in
'95 which, like his current film, is done in a cinema verite
style--and is a look at aimless New York City teens focusing
on Telly, who deflowers virgins, and Jennie, who faces the
consequences of one encounter with Telly.  As with "Kids"
and "Tulsa," Clark is again nonjudgmental, simply
highlighting two teenagers who are like stray dogs, abused
since they were young who pair off and find comfort, even
love, in each other's arms.  </P>
<P>   Based on an unpublished prison manuscript by Eddie Little,
"Another Day in Paradise" opens on the two young people
making love, after which the hyperactive Bobbie runs off to
the site of his latest petty heist, a storehouse of vending
machines which he tears open to steal the quarters.
Severely injured by a sadistic security guard, he takes refuge
with the exciting uncle of a drug buddy, Mel (James Woods)
who patches him up with a shot of heroin and prepares him
for the big time.  Together with Sid (Melanie Griffith) and
Rosie (Natasha Gregson Wagner), the newly-charged
criminals execute robberies, one of which turns out
disastrous.  The real fun of the movie rests in the activities of
the foursome between jobs, and Clark is superb in capturing
the exhilaration the young people feel when they are treated
like royalty--taken on shopping sprees, plied with champagne,
and introduced to one of the mid-west's emporiums for blues. 
During these scenes you're likely to discount the shady side
and think of Sid and Mel as the sorts of parents you wish you
had. They're super cool, they show high regard for their
charges, they give them a sense of responsibility, however
perverted.  </P>
<P>   While Clark is not trying to lay a morality tale on us, he
does show the other side of the outlaw trade.  When Mel
turns from a fun guy to a somber, wrath-of-God malefactor,
the ambiance takes a turn away from the pleasure of the high
life to show the steep price that often must be paid.  While
Woods plays exactly to type--a male Judy Davis but far more
dangerous--he shows us that even when crime pays, the
criminal's lot is, on the whole, not a happy one.  </P>
<P>   The relatively unknown Vincent Kartheiser teams up
fortuitously with Natasha Gregson Wagner (the daughter of
Natalie Wood) providing gut-wrenching chemistry.  "Another
Day in Paradise" has witty dialogue for Woods, fine ensemble
acting by Griffith, Kartheiser and Wagner, and best of all a
relentless mood of anxiety and excitement.  During its first
half you agree with Rosie when she calls Bobbie "the best
thing that ever happened to me" and with Sid when she
names Mel "the best boyfriend I ever had."  Later on you
want to advise them to get out more often.</P>
