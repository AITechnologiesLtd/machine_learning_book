<PRE>                               SIMPATICO
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     I love a good thriller.  And no one makes good thrillers any more.
Enter SIMPATICO, with a cast boasting both Nick Nolte and Jeff Bridges,
not to mention Albert Finney and Sharon Stone -- all set among the
intrigue of a scandal involving horse racing, blackmail, and steamy
sex.  How could this miss?</P>
<P>     By being as straightforward as, well, a horse race.  It's just a
big loop from start to finish.  No real surprises along the way, just
jockeying for position.  SIMPATICO finishes right where it started, with
a time of 106 minutes.</P>
<P>     Based on the play by Sam Shepard, Nolte, Bridges, and Stone play a
trio of friends, long since torn apart by a scam gone awry in their
youth.  As we quickly learn, Bridges (now a famous horse breeder and
racer) is now being blackmailed by his old pal Nolte (now a bum in
California).</P>
<P>     The plot thickens.  Nolte phones out of the blue: Something is
amiss.  Bridges quickly flies to California, but things don't go as
planned.</P>
<P>     The problem with SIMPATICO is that no one expects things to go as
planned.  That Nolte is going to double-cross Bridges is a given.
Exactly why is a mystery, and that's one that, sadly, never gets
explained.  In fact, that can be said for the entire film.  Example: Why
Bridges decides to send Nolte's girlfriend to Kentucky to work a deal
for him is inexplicable and bizarre.</P>
<P>     Ditto the behavior of all the characters.  SIMPATICO merits barely
a "Hmmm" on the surprise-o-meter.  Instead of crafting deft plot twists,
the film relies on random behavior and a confusing structure designed to
dole the story out in tiny bits over the entire running time.</P>
<P>     Why?  If they told it like it really was, you'd realize there
wasn't much of a movie here.  SIMPATICO is a very pretty film, and its
stars do as much as possible with their roles.  It's just that the roles
don't do much for them.</P>
