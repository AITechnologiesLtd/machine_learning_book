<PRE>                               CARRIED AWAY
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>Carried Away (1996) **** out of ***** - C:Dennis Hopper, Amy Irving, Amy
Locane, Gary Busey, Hal Holbrook. W:Ed Jones. D:Bruno Barreto.</P>
<P>Hopper, in a refreshing change from his recent trend of playing nothing but
psychopaths, is a small town school teacher who was crippled as a child in a
farming accident. He has maintained a simple life in the small town where he
was born. He takes care of his ailing mother and is in a relationship with
his childhood sweetheart and fellow teacher (Irving). His life is shaken up
drastically, however, when a new student, Catherine (Locane) arrives in his
class.</P>
<P>Her father (Busey), an ex-military man, comes to Hopper's farm to ask if
they can board a horse there. Hopper accepts, which means that Catherine
will be spending a great deal of time there. One day he goes to look for
Catherine and finds her up in the hay loft of the barn. She promptly removes
her clothes and the two have sex (although Hopper is hesitant at first, he
quickly gives in). Thus begins an affair between the two.</P>
<P>My only problem with the film was that moment right there. It seemingly
happened for no reason. Nothing prompted it. We never see why this teenaged
girl was immediately drawn to a crippled older man. Towards the end we are
led to believe that Catherine is slightly insane, but by then it really
doesn't matter anymore.</P>
<P>Hopper tries to conceal this affair from his girlfriend, but also uses his
newfound youthfulness to better his relationship with Irving. For a while it
works, that is until the affair becomes public knowledge. Naturally, Irving
is enraged and a rift develops between the two. Holbrook plays the town
doctor and family friend who becomes the first to discover (accidentally)
about the affair. He has some good scenes and some funny lines when he
confronts Hopper.</P>
<P>Movies like this aren't made very often, which is good because when they do
come along, they are much more appreciated. "Carried Away" tells such a
simple story, one you've no doubt seen before. But it still seems fresh,
thanks to exceptional acting from all involved and excellent detail for the
time period. I could have done without the five minutes of full frontal
Hopper late in the film, but it wasn't difficult to just look away until the
scene was over. As just a note of trivia: Amy Irving is the director's wife.</P>
