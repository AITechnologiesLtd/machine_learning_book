<PRE>Against Squall Odds
The Perfect Storm</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>In a small Massachusetts fishing village, the season comes to a close smack
dab in the middle of Sword-boat Captain Billy Tyne's slump. Again, his crew
returns from the sea with a pittance of a catch, leaving them all with a
pain in the pocket book. Taking the hit personally, Clooney (the Skipper)
decides to sail the ship out one more time after only a day and half's stay
in hopes of restocking his fish bins and confidence. The fishermen try to
balance their lives on land with the steep ocean swells. First mate Wahlberg
puts it this way, "I got a woman I can't stand to be two feet away from.
Then again, I love to fish." Captain George knows the quandary, "Son, you
got a problem."</P>
<P>Slow going like the fish-catching, the first half of the film is as bland as
the second half is exciting. We must first be introduced to our crew and
their loved ones (and rivals) on land before we go to sea. The perfect storm
doesn't even begin to brew until the halfway mark at which point the crew
must decide to venture into the bowels of hell or safely wait it out while
their valuable catch spoils. Of course, they go for it.</P>
<P>And what a storm it is! Though digitally assisted, this is one "in your
face" hurricane. Huge waves, thick soot-filled clouds, winds with the force
of an anchor slung from a chain. Clooney and Wahlberg slide all over this
water-engorged deck as the sea comes at them from every direction. The
team's turmoil is integrated with a battered 24 foot sailboat's tumult and a
coast guard helicopter rescue team as they brave the skies of bullet rain.
This high intensity action sequence will have you clutching the arms of your
seat, or the arms of the person seated next to you.</P>
<P>The story itself has many of the elements of the disaster film formula: the
waiting loved ones, the feuding crewmates, the slick newscaster tracking the
story. The script offers standard dialogue, just to tell the story, nothing
much to chew on. So the weaker actors don't get any help from the writers.
The most interesting character drama comprises a couple of chips shouldered
by two feuding fishermen. Reilly and Fichtner have the acting power to back
up the animosity. Despite good performance by Clooney and Wahlberg, these
rivaling crewmen give the film it's strongest character driven drama.</P>
<P>Quite slow from the gate to half, where it rushes like a waterfall to the
near end, it's a stirring ride, but not a must see film.</P>
