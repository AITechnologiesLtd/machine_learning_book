<P>    I've got to give the makers of Fallen credit for trying something
high-minded and going through with it for the most part. The film is
composed of appealing ideas and characters, and often times it even
works, but after hearing about this story, I would have handled the
execution completely differently. This could have been a deeply
disturbing film, moving and profound on multiple levels. Too bad,
because it waters down its own dark themes, and shifts with unnatural
tonal changes. The result is an original, well-acted film that tiptoes
around greatness and ends up falling far short of the mark.</P>
<P>    Denzel Washington stars as John Hobbes, the New York detective who
narrates the story. In the beginning, we find that he has just put away
serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas in a brief but energetic
performance). It doesn't take long for Hobbes to find out that the
spirit of the killer is being passed around from body to body by means
of touch--in one frantic sequence, he watches on the street as each
passerby stares him in the eye with a demonic grin. He enlists the help
of theologian Gretta Milano (Embeth Davidtz); as it turns out, her
father went through the exact same situation that Hobbes is going
through at the time of the film.</P>
<P>    Fallen is a strange case. I immediately knew there was something
wrong when the lively '60s tune Time is on My Side (I think that's what
it's called...) began blaring during the credits. Credits, for me, set
the tone of the film, and this is not what I'd expect from a film called
Fallen about serial killers and spirits gone awry. This isn't a severe
misstep, however--the narration is a far bigger problem. Washington is a
terrific actor, and this is a great performance, but his voice is just
not good for narration. He sounds too happy, too nice for it to be a
foreboding element. It's not really comical, but with his voice in there
all along, there isn't really any doubt that he's going to be okay. In
that case, a central element of suspense in the film is lost.</P>
<P>    This leads right into another striking problem with the film--it
isn't scary enough. This is a story that sent a tingle down my spine
when I saw the preview. The ideas here have so much promise--just the
thought of a killer who can pass from person to person so easily is
utterly unnerving. The execution, though, could have been so much more
eerie. It's creepy just in nature, but it could have been downright out
of control. The director, Gregory Hoblit, is not entirely to blame for
this: I think the fatal error here is the fact that the audience knows
what's going on far too early--this is dramatic irony at its most
extreme. We get to find out what's going on just from seeing the
trailer, but Hobbes doesn't get in on the secret until halfway through
the film.</P>
<P>    With the central idea behind the film let out so early, it's truly
hard to be afraid of it. Another big mistake is the usage of
first-person from the eyes of the spirit. There is something about
seeing what it sees that totally eliminates all suspense from the
situation. There is one truly breathtaking moment, involving the
basement of a lonely cabin and a lot of spider webs, but most of the
film lacks this kind of intense uncertainty.</P>
<P>    Still, there is a lot to like about this film. The performances, for
one, are all great. Washington is always convincing as the cop who is
seemingly at the center of this supernatural joke. John Goodman, who
plays Hobbes' partner, manages to create an interesting character in the
limited screen time he's given, and Donald Sutherland is good as always
as Hobbes' boss. I also liked Davidtz--she displayed the same kind of
strength that she did as Helen Hirsch in Schindler's List.</P>
<P>    It's a decent film, but you'll know when you watch it that it's been
tested and toned down from what it was originally supposed to be. The
ending, too, feels like a major cheat. The ideas behind this film are
superb--highly imaginative and ultimately convincing. As far as the
execution is from what I wanted, the film still engaged me. I liked the
characters enough, and the situation is extremely interesting.</P>
<P>    It's pretty rare that films take on this religious, demonic tone.
Last year I went into The Devil's Advocate not expecting much, and I got
a forceful, extremely moving and often disturbing picture. Fallen
promises as much but didn't deliver--this film should have been directed
by David Fincher. Had it been darker and more ominous, Fallen would have
been a truly great film. It takes the easier path, though, and ends up
just making you wish that someone in the production had thought that we
could have handled something more hard-hitting.</P>
