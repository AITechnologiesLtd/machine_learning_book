<P>     Every so often, about once a year, you stumble upon a quirky film
that is so suffused with humanity, that so touches you in a unique and
tender way, that you forget all the turkeys you've sat through for the
past year ... that you almost turn religious thanking God for the
privilege of being a movie goer.  It is what film festivals were made
for.  For me, in 1993, it was TANGO ARGENTINO.  This year's find is
CRONOS.</P>
<P>     This jewel of a film defies classification: almost even balance
between an effective, low-budget horror flick, Hitchcock suspense, and
a touching, personal family drama.  It's an amazing debut for director
Guillermo del Toro (who also wrote the taut screenplay).  Guillermo
Navarro's honey-toned camera virtually hides all signs of the limited
budget, and the inspired casting makes this film a gift.  A world of
choices must have been rejected by the deft art director.  With an
alchemist's touch, director del Toro has turned something as hoary as a
vampire tale into solid gold.</P>
<P>     Sadly (see interview with director at end, which contain
plot-spoilers), over twenty minutes of the film was lost, due to a
flawed lens, so there are times that the story line is a bit abrupt.
If the lost footage had survived, this may have been another SHOP ON
MAINSTREET.  What survived from this single camera shoot comes damn
close to that treasure of a film.</P>
<P>     THE PLOT: a fast paced prologue reveals that an alchemist fled the
Spanish Inquisition to Colonial Mexico, while working on the secret of
eternal life through a timepiece of sorts (the Cronos, which resembles
a Faberge Easter Egg, "with a twist.").  A collapsed ceiling in the
1930's sends a sliver of wood and plaster through his heart, calling it
"curtains" for the 500-year-old vampire/alchemist.  Narration assures
us that though every item of the alchemist's estate was catalogued and
auctioned, the Cronos device was never found.  The camera makes a brief
sweep of what might have been Jeffrey Dahmler's kitchen.</P>
<P>     Fast forward to 1997, where the impish director/screenwriter gives
us a wry view of post NAFTA Mexico: signs in English/Spanish/Russian/
Japanese and Chinese fortune cookies being served as part of the
Christmas festivities.  English freely intermixed with Spanish
dialogue.</P>
<P>     Jesus Gris and his eight-year-old granddaughter, Aurora, have a
suspicious visitor to his antique shop.  The stranger is overly
interested in a Colonial archangel (which we've earlier seen in the
alchemist's Colonial laboratory).  The visitor, who was obviously casing
the joint, leaves without a purchase.  Curiosity piqued, Jesus pries
open the base, and discovers the alchemists secret Cronos-device.  His
curiosity sets the device in motion, and it literally gets its
"clutches" in him (shades of ALIEN!) altering the course of his life ...
forever.  Soon it's revealed that a wealthy, cancer-ridden villain,
who has the alchemist's instruction manual, but not the Cronos-device,
catches on to Jesus's "secret."  But the screenplay departs from all of
the usual plot turns one is accustomed to in a mainstream Hollywood
potboiler with a heavy dose of "chase" at it's core.</P>
<P>     Inspired casting includes Ron Perlman (THE NAME OF THE ROSE),
very recognizable as Linda Hamilton's "Beast" from the pre-Disney TV
series.  He plays an overgrown dufus, nephew to the eternity-obsessed
villain.  His obsession with an upcoming nose job, and nauseating
personal habits that literally defy description, provide steady comic
relief.</P>
<P>     But it is the enchanting combination of Argentinian actor Federico
Luppi as the grandfather, and Tamara Shanath as his hauntingly
beautiful, mute granddaughter, which elevates this film above the pale
of similar films about the "undead." Some of the lost footage (see
below) explained their deep connection, but the silent looks they
exchange in the surviving footage convey world's of meaning.  You may
find yourself holding your breath involuntarily at several points
throughout the film.  Ultimately, this grandfather literally goes to
hell and back, as a price for his curiosity, becoming a Christ-like
figure who must choose between eternal life and sacrifice for the one
he loves most.</P>
<P>     Incidentally, del Toro wrote his screenplay with Argentinian
actor, Federico Luppi, in mind.  Due to del Toro's youthful appearance,
Luppi thought he was a delivery boy when he showed up on his doorstep
with the script.  Luppi dismissed del Toro as an arrogant young pup,
when the hopeful director said, "I'd like to discuss this with you once
you've read it."  Luppi's world-class performance may inspire you to
reach for those Berlitz Spanish tapes you put on the back burner, in
order to more fully appreciate his earlier films in their original
tongue.</P>
<P>     The film contains grisly, explicit violence, which often comes off
amazingly inoffensive, when balanced with the rest of the film.  The
director treads a very thin line at times, between classic Alfred
Hitchcock suspense and John Waters high camp, black humor.  It is a
line that has tripped more experienced talent (Peter Bogdonovich and
Mel Brooks numerous times).  Del Toro might be a candidate for Cirque
du Soleil for succeeding in his amazing balancing act.  The inspired
musical score has a lot to do with the successful weight of the film.
(Please, God, let there be a soundtrack!  It's in Dolby.)</P>
<P>     Another unique aspect of this film is its almost 50/50 balance
between English dialogue and subtitled Spanish.  The American
characters understand everything that is said to them in Spanish, yet
stubbornly answer in English.  (How like the first Anglo arrivals to
California.)  As a result, the experience doesn't have the "feel" of a
foreign language film.</P>
<PRE>NOTES FROM Q & A WITH THE DIRECTOR: 
(contains plot mega-spoilers)</PRE>
<P>     Director del Toro confessed to combining two obsessions in his
screenplay;  his fascination with insects (there is a live one at the
heart of the Cronos device) and what he sees as the "synergy" between
vampirism and Latino Catholicism. "I always thought of the host and
communion as Christian Sushi," he joked, in heavily accented English,
"as a child I wondered how they preserved that body of Christ for such
a long time, to still be eating it in church!"</P>
<P>     "My grandmother was so religious," continued the boyish,
anglo-looking director, "that by age 11 I was the official spokesperson
for the Virgin Mary."  What del Toro described as the unbalanced
emphasis on damnation over redemption in his local church obviously had
a heavy hand in some of the haunting makeup and imagery chosen for the
film.</P>
<P>     Deliberate parallels to the life of Christ and insects were
sprinkled throughout the screenplay.  The grandfather, who
eventually/temporarily "dies," resurrects on the third day.  One
character comments that God may have loved insects most of all,
"mosquitos walk on water ...  Jesus walks on water."  There are several
plot references to insects being "perfect machines," while the man-made
machine (Cronos) runs awry in the havoc it wrecks on the main
characters.</P>
<P>THE LOST FILM REELS:
     Due to the low budget, footage was shot in Mexico, and processed
in Los Angeles.  "We had weeklies, not dailies," del Toro commented.
Tragically, over a week's worth of shooting was lost due to a flawed,
out of focus lens.  Budget and schedule  didn't permit any retakes.</P>
<P>     WHAT WAS LOST: the original screenplay revealed that young Aurora
retreated into a mute fantasy world after her parents left, never to
return.  She is being raised by Jesus, her grandfather, and his wife,
who teaches Tango lessons.  A lost scene showed Jesus lovingly writing
fake post cards to Aurora from her dead parents.  The fact that she
accepts this fantasy of distant, yet loving parents, makes her
non-chalant reaction to her grandfather's predicament (she's the only
witness) ring true.</P>
<P>     In a brief, touching scene that survives, we see the resurrected
and deteriorating Jesus painfully writing a love letter to his grieving
"widow," trying to explain why he can't permit her to see him.  In a
lost, succeeding sequence, Jesus then silently slipped into his wife's
bedroom, where he tenderly placed his note in her sleeping hand.  He
falls asleep, unnoticed, next to her, until dawn, when he must leave
(having become a vampire).</P>
<P>     On waking, the "widow" can't believe the note she finds, and
logically assumes that mute Aurora has written it. "What do you think
this is, another one of your crazy postcards?" she screams, tossing the
family secret out into the open.  According to del Torro, the look on
young Aurora's face, in the badly fogged footage, was unforgettable.</P>
<P>     The surviving footage has a rather abrupt jump, early in the film,
to the rejuvenated grandfather (after his first dose of Cronos) finding
that his antique shop had been trashed.  Lost in the fogged footage is
what sounds like a wonderful scene, where the night before, he
rediscovers his lost virility.  He tries to romance his wife, only to
be rejected, because she's too tired from her Tango lessons to realize
what she's missing.  This lost scene makes her later refusal to believe
or accept his painful post-mortem note even more touching.  What does
survive, is an unforgettable image of the resurrected grandfather,
fresh from the mortuary, calling his wife from a pay phone in the
pouring rain, only to have her hang up on him (because it obviously
must be a "crank" call).</P>
<P>     The film was shot on a budget of $1.2 million, which actually cost
over $2 million American due to the 30% Mexican interest loans.  It was
completed on a frantic eight-week schedule.  Though we'll never know
exactly how great the film might have been with the lost footage, we
can celebrate having found a new director who may be just the one to
shed light on the newly changed relationship between America and
Mexico.  By any measure or scale, CRONOS is an amazingly brilliant
first effort.</P>
<P>     Fortunately, this film has distribution.  Run, don't walk to your
nearest repertory film house and direct them to:</P>
