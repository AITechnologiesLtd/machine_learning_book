<PRE>"Mercury Rising"  -- A Degree of Suspense, Warmth
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>Bruce Willis plays FBI agent Art Jeffries in a film about compassion and
conspiracy.  As a man living with a ghost and looking for redemption,
his chance for penitence comes when he is called to investigate a crime
involving the slain parents of Simon Lynch (Miko Hughes), an autistic
child.  Why were the parents killed?  The audience knows that Simon's
autism gives him the ability to 'see through' a newly developed
government supercode called Mercury.  A Mercury-encrypted message was
slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine, and when Simon reads it, he
calls a phone number revealed within the message.  When NSA officials
learn of this, they believe that Simon is a dangerous threat to national
security and decides to take drastic actions. "Nothing can connect the
boy to this office," says the NSA officer (Alec Baldwin).  Jeffries,
however, is unable to question the boy because of his condition.  But
when he learns that Simon's life is in jeopardy, he takes it upon
himself, at great risk, to take care of Simon and try to learn why Simon
is being relentlessly hunted down.  </P>
<P>This may seem like a formulaic movie to some degree, and indeed, several
elements here can be found in many other films of the same genre.  For
example, during his investigation, Jeffries must go into hiding as
several parties make him the target of a manhunt.  He has no personal or
family ties which justifies his apparent willingness to go way above and
beyond the call of duty.  He even has a partner who is reluctant to help
at first but then eventually gives in.  However, there are several
elements that makes this an enjoyable movie.</P>
<P>What I appreciated about this film was its restraint.  It finds a
suitable middle-ground that melds action and drama.  It never went
over-the-top, and took itself seriously by carefully underscoring its
dramatic elements.  Willis is perfectly cast as the anti-hero and ably
handles the reigns of this film.  He realizes that the stakes are high
and that saving the boy is not some kind of cavalier stunt.  His fear
and frustration can be seen on his face.  Despite his pug nature, he
tries to do the right thing.  A subtle level of suspense is maintained
throughout the film.  In a nicely executed sequence, both Jeffries and a
hired killer are looking for Simon in the hospital where Simon is
staying.  Later, all 3 of them wind up in the same elevator.  Our
attachment to Simon is quickly developed, and we cringe when the bad
guys begin to close in or when Simon decides to walk out into a middle
of a busy intersection or onto the middle of the train tracks.  We also
feel good when we see Jeffries finally begin to make inroads into
Simon's autistic world.</P>
<P>Mercury Rising has several moments that begs you to be 'open-minded' and
not question the reasoning behind some of the actions taken.  If you can
make these minor sacrifices, like I did, then it offers enough to make
this a satisfying movie experience.</P>
