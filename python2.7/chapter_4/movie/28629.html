<PRE>"Cats & Dogs"</PRE>
<P>Since time began, the fight for world domination has been going on between
two powerful and intelligent adversaries. Unknown to mankind, cats had once
wielded supreme power until the canines of the world threw out these feline
dictators. Since then, the struggle has continued until now when kitty-cat
leader, Mr. Tinkles (voice of Sean Hayes) has come up with a plan for him
and his minion to take back power and rule the world once again in "Cats &
Dogs."</P>
<P>Just look at the concept presented here: talking, smart cats and dogs wage
a war - the cats want to take over and the dogs, the loyal creature that
they are, want to save man from feline tyranny. Throw into this mix a mad
scientist, Professor Brody (Jeff Goldblum,) who is on the brink of finding
a permanent cure for dog allergies, a cure that would make it possible for
every man woman and child to own a dog. The cats, led by Mr. Tinkles, will
stop at nothing to destroy the formula and put Mr. T at the helm of a
kitty-dominated world.</P>
<P>When the Brodys' canine guardian Buddy is catnapped, a new protector must
been put in the old bloodhound's place to make sure the family is safe and
unaware of any danger. Circumstance pushes a cute beagle pup into their
household and the little guy soon learns of the evil feline plan. He is
recruited by doggie secret agent Butch (Alec Baldwin) and undergoes an
intensive course of training to fulfill his mission - protect the formula
and the family. When the Brody son, Scotty (Alexander Pollock), rejects the
puppy, calling him "Loser," or "Lou" for short, it becomes the little dog's
additional mission to become the boy's best friend.</P>
<P>This all sounds like a great idea - on paper, at least. Talking cats and
dogs, high-tech special F/X and a story concept that seems like a real
winner should make this a good, if not great, kids' movie. It isn't and
fails, miserably, in bringing any life to the wooden, unfunny screenplay by
John Requa and Glenn Ficarra. The elements of a successful film are there,
but the unentertaining story that should bring the animals and the F/X
together falls flat on its face. What we get is a routine fantasy with bad
kitties trying to take over the world and the good doggies out to stop
them. Throwing in numerous James Bond references - like an evil Russian
Blue cat hurling a knife at Lou, saying it's "from Russia with love," get
it? - and lots of high-tech gear like doggie rocket sleds is supposed to
make it exciting. Well, maybe for very small kids, but I think not for
anyone else.</P>
<P>The vocal talents used to give voice to the cats and dogs are okay, but
none of them breaths real life into their animal personas. Compare this
film, for example, with the much funnier anthropomorphic efforts in the
recent "Dr. Dolittle 2," where a few lines by a raccoon with rabies
provides more laughs than the entirety of "Cats & Dogs." Toby Maguire is
bland as the voice of little Lou. Alec Baldwin gives strength to his
vocalization of Butch, but he fights a losing battle. Sean Hayes is more
annoying than sinister as the power hungry feline, Mr. Tinkles. Wasted are
the vocal efforts of Susan Sarandon, Joe Pantoliano, Michael Clarke Duncan,
Jon Lovitz (who should have had a heck of a lot more fun as the toady
hench-kitty, Calico) and, especially, Charleton Heston. Live action players
Goldblum and Elizabeth Perkins must be told they made a horrible career
decision showing up here.</P>
<P>It is unfortunate that the special F/X team, led by Ed Jones and utilizing
the talents of Jim Henson's Creature Shop, are saddled with the incredibly
lame story. These folks make the animals do the impossible - talk, fly,
engage in martial arts and operate a rocket sled - and could have, with a
well-written, intelligent story and its execution, made this a fun summer
flick. As I have said many times before, special F/X, alone, do not make a
movie and even a kiddie pick should have intelligence and wit. "Cats &
Dogs" just batters you with the inane and lots of it.</P>
<P>Whoever created the theatrical trailer should be applauded (or disdained)
for doing such a great job in making a bad movie look good. Maybe that crew
should have made "Cats & Dogs." This is a case of shoot those responsible
and forgive the technicians. I give it a D.</P>
