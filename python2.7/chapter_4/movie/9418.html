<P>Chad'z rating: ***1/2 (out of 4 = very good)</P>
<P>1971, R, 136 minutes [2 hours, 16 minutes]</P>
<PRE>[science fiction]</PRE>
<P>starring: Malcolm McDowell (Alex), Patrick Magee (Mr. Frank Alexander),
Anthony Sharp (Minister of the Interior), Michael Bates (Chief Guard),
written, produced, and directed by Stanley Kubrick, based on the novel by
Anthony Burgess.</P>
<P>"A Clockwork Orange" may be the epitome of the idea of portraying a theme
through allegory. The only problem is that sometimes the allegory becomes
blatant, but the story told is still interesting because of its bizarre
nature. </P>
<P>The film takes place in an alternate reality, where crime is out of control
and technology seems both advanced yet ancient at the same time. We don't
know how the world got this way, it is just implied and assumed as Gothic,
sci-fi tale. </P>
<P>We meet the four "Droogs" as lead by Alex (McDowell), a sadistic hoodlum
with a sharp wit and quick reflexes. The Droogs go around beating up bums for
pleasure, fighting with other gangs simply because of rivalry, and have even
more fun by storming the countryside and raping a woman while forcing her
husband to look on. This is a very disturbing picture, not in just the
graphicness, but because of the pleasure they take in their actions. Kubrick
uses this to emphasize the human element by paradoxically dehumanizing the
characters.</P>
<P>A "Julius Ceaser" plot develops when the Droogs betray Alex and lead him to
be captured by the police. Almost instantly the film starts to lose its
artistic edge, as everything seems "normal" compared to the surrealistic
opening. Alex is sentenced to prison, but we don't get a surrealistic, brutal
image of prison. Instead, Alex studies with the prison chaplin, and reads the
Old Testament because of its many violent tales of war.  </P>
<P>The real theme of the story starts to develop when Alex volunteers for a
psychological "cure" created by the government to reduce crime. The
treatment's premise seems promising, as it will subconsciously stop Alex from
committing crime, but in effect, he loses his sense of true free will. Some
will argue man has no free will to begin with, and this film serves as a
battleground for such philosophical arguments.</P>
<P>When Alex finds himself wandering the streets, the earlier Gothic mood seems
to be gone. Through a series of events that are almost mirror images of the
beginning of the story, Alex becomes the victim. </P>
<P>As moving as "A Clockwork Orange" is, it could have been even more powerful
had it not be so gratuitous in some respects. I found the much of the nudity
and sexual innuendo quite excessive. I loved the dark, twisted mood that
opens the film, but why wasn't the atmosphere as surrealistic throughout?
Still, the film's ability to make for such a grand theme despite its shock
value is remarkable. </P>
