                       A film review by David N. Butterworth
          Copyright 1997 David N. Butterworth/The Summer Pennsylvanian</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: **1/2 (Maltin scale)</PRE>
<P>Julianne is on a mission.  To wreck the upcoming wedding of her best
friend, Michael.  And in the process, just maybe, win his heart.</P>
<P>If this sounds like a recipe for prenuptial hilarity, then you're certainly
on the same page as the filmmakers.  Director P.J. Hogan's previous outing
was the hysterical ugly-duckling tale "Muriel's Wedding," with which he
demonstrated his deft skill at comedy.  "Muriel" was also moving, sad, and
a little bit tragic.  The sadness in my "My Best Friend's Wedding,"
however, is not part of Ronald Bass' script.  It's the uneasy feeling you
get from watching these characters play out their passions and their petty
jealousies, realizing that, unless polygamy suddenly becomes an option,
someone's going to be left crying at the altar.</P>
<P>Hogan's new film is, disappointingly, a little more mainstream than
"Muriel."  This means, for example, that Julia Roberts, who plays Julianne,
plays off America's recent fascination with the spectacle of beautiful
women falling down, popularized by Brooke Shields and Tia Leoni on prime
time television.  In "My Best Friend's Wedding," Roberts hits the deck
close to half a dozen times.  The first, when she tumbles off the bed when
Michael (Dermot Mulroney) tells her he's popped the question...to someone
else!...is funny.  After that, the pratfalls seem overdone and unnecessary,
and while Roberts is still as appealing as ever, she's no Chevy Chase.</P>
<P>Aiding and abetting Julianne in her wrench-throwing activities is her gay
friend George (the stiff upper lipped Rupert Everett), who flies in to the
Windy City and temporarily poses as her fiance.  "It's amazing the clarity
that comes with psychotic jealously," George observes, once Julianne
realizes she really does love Michael, suddenly the man of her dreams.
Everett exudes charisma all over the place; it's a broad but charming
supporting performance.  The object of Michael's affections is Kimmy,
played by Cameron Diaz.  Diaz is bubbly and believable as the "bright eyed
and dreamy" rival who threatens Julianne's sense of ownership.</P>
<P>In fact, Julianne, George and Kimmy are all likable, well-developed
characters.  The Michael character looks good on the surface, but does
little else to deserve the attention he gets.</P>
<P>In keeping with Hogan's love for musical interludes ("Muriel's Wedding" was
punctuated by Abba songs), "My Best Friend's Wedding" drums up a few of its
own, from the irresistibly cute opening title number, to a painful Karaoke
sequence, to a scene in a fish restaurant where everyone at the table joins
in a rendition of "Say a Little Prayer for You."  The only problem with
most of these moments is that they go on way too long.</P>
<P>While Julia Roberts and her co-stars sparkle, "My Best Friend's Wedding" is
an uneasy mix of well-realized humor and unrealized sadness.</P>
