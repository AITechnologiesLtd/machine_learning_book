<P>Imagine a city where superheroes are a dime a dozen. They're all over the
place, crowding the costume shops and karate stores; tripping over each other
in an attempt to make a name for themselves. Unfotunately, all these
superheroes are also godawful at their jobs. This is the basic premise behind
the very amusing comic book superhero spoof "Mystrey Men". With an all star
cast, an often hilarious script, and great visuals, this is one of the few
truly good satires in recent memory.</P>
<P>Captain Amazing, Champion City's protector, has a problem. His funding is
slowly being cut by all the major companies which sponsor his crime fighting.
This is because he has captured or killed all the real super villains, and is
now reduced to fighting street punks. In an effort to revive his dwindling
career, he arranges for the release of his old nemesis, Cassanova Frankenstein.
His intention is to fight the villain in a climactic battle and win back
support. However, there's one small flaw in his plan. Frankenstein is
brilliant, and Amazing is a moron. Captured by Cassanova, Amazing's only hope
lies with a group of superhero wannabes. Mr. Furious, who seems to have the
power to get really mad; The Shoveler, who hits people with his shovel (imagine
that) Blue Raja, who throws forks with deadly accuracy; Invisible Boy, who is
only invisible if no one looks at him; The Bowler, who throws a bowling ball
filled with her father's skull; The Sphinx, who speaks like a rather dumbed
down version of Yoda; and The Spleen, who is an expert with, umm, gas. The
motley band attempts to free the real superhero, while making some sort of name
for themselves. </P>
<P>For a long time, I was quite a comic book fan. I collected just about every
comic imaginable. However, there were certain things in them which always
rather bothered me. For example, why couldn't anyone tell that Clark Kent and
Superman were one and the same? Mystery Men covers that in a very amusing
discussion the heroes have while in a diner. The movie does, in fact, take so
much glee in poking fun at comic book styple heroes, that some of the gags run
on a bit too long. The Spleen, for instance, gets a little annoying by the
film's end. However, most of the humor is right on target, such as when the
heroes are creating their new costumes.</P>
<P>As for the acting, from a cast like this one expects the best, and in this
case, receives the best. All the actors appear to be having an absolute blast
with their roles. Hank Azaria was my absolute favorite as the Blue Raja,
speaking in a hilarious English accent, and constantly attempting to explain
why he has one when his name and costume are obviously Indian. The rest of the
cast are uniformly great, each character having odd litle quirks which never
failed to make the audience laugh uproariously. The only character who never
really seemed to find his niche was Invisible Boy, who basically sat in the
background through most of the film.</P>
<P>If you don't care for spoofs, don't see this movie. If you don't like comic
books, you might not enjoy this. Otherwise, try and catch "Mystery Men". It's
one of the best entries into the genre in recent memory, and earns four stars.</P>
<P>* * * * * - One of the greatest movies ever made, see it now.
* * * * - Great flick. Try and catch this one.
* * * - Okay movie, hits and misses.
* * - Pretty bad. See it if you've got nothing better to do.
* - One of the worst movies ever. See it only if you enjoy pain.</P>
