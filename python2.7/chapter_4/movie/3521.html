<P>     At first glance, one might place NEW JERSEY DRIVE alongside the 
likes of BOYZ 'N THE HOOD, SOUTH CENTRAL, and MENACE II SOCIETY.  Each 
of these film is, after all, about the struggle of today's black youth 
to escape the endless cycle of inner city violence.  However, 
similarities end at the basic theme.  Writer/director Nick Gomez takes a 
route that sacrifices narrative for perspective.  Ultimately, his 
characters become secondary to an exploration of the principles and 
attitudes of those who live each day believing "it's open season on the 
black man." </P>
<P>     Although the film is set in Newark, New Jersey (the "car theft 
capital of the world"), it could take place in virtually any major 
American city.  Location is less important than viewpoint, and the 
issues with which the characters cope can be found all across the 
country.  To Jason (Sharron Corley) and Midget (Gabriel Casseus), 
stealing a car is, at worst, a minor infraction.  They take a new 
vehicle every night, go for a joyride, then drop it off.  Occasionally, 
when they really need money, they visit a chop shop.  The police, led by 
a sadistic bigot named Roscoe (Saul Stein) are always close, hounding 
the two whether they've done something or not.  On those occasions when 
they actually catch their quarry, the cops are as likely to beat them 
and leave them on the street as to drag them off to jail. </P>
<P>     The strengths of BOYZ 'N THE HOOD were characters and plot.  In 
that film, writer/director John Singleton fashioned a shocking story 
centered around a believable group of young black men.  Here, although 
Nick Gomez is working with two teenage protagonists that would seemingly 
fit in with the HOOD crowd, he doesn't display any particular skill for 
creating multi-dimensional personalities, and the storyline is 
pedestrian.  What NEW JERSEY DRIVE does well, however, is present a 
perspective. </P>
<P>     By the end of the film, you may not sympathize with Jason, but you 
will understand him.  All that happens in NEW JERSEY DRIVE is skewed to 
give a participant's view of life on the streets.  Every cop is 
portrayed as a racist.  This may not reflect an impartial "truth", but 
it emphasizes Jason and Midget's take on reality.  The cops are the 
enemy, and these two can't afford to see anything other than the 
negatives about Roscoe and his co-workers.  Looking through the eyes of 
the protagonists, neither can we. </P>
<P>     Though it follows the exploits of petty criminals and bent cops, 
NEW JERSEY DRIVE never loses its moral perspective.  Jason's mother 
(Gwen McGee) wants her son to stay in school so he eventually can free 
himself from the inner city.  And when Jason sees his sister running 
with a "bad" crowd, he risks his safety to get her away from them, 
recognizing from his own experience the dangers inherent in such an 
association.  </P>
<P>     Cinematographer Adam Kimmel's camera work maintains an intimate 
outlook, adding to the sense of "being there."  There are times when 
this movie feels more like a documentary than a work of fiction--and 
therein lies its strength.  For, while the story of NEW JERSEY DRIVE 
lacks originality, the manner in which it is presented offers a fresh, 
and sometimes jarring, point of view. </P>
