<P>Remember way back in December when I reviewed "Any Given Sunday" and 
wondered if, as an actor, Al Pacino had grown as tired as his football 
coach character was?  Well, based on his performance in The Insider, 
Pacino is as full of piss and vinegar as he was back in his Dog Day 
Afternoon prime.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
In a movie populated with far too many characters to give proper 
attributes to in this small space, the central characters of Jeffrey 
Wigand (Russell Crowe), Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) and Mike Wallace 
(Christopher Plummer) stand out most.  Jeffrey Wigand, a scientist and 
V.P. at tobacco giant Brown & Williamson, is pursued by CBS' "60 
Minutes" producer Lowell Bergman after Wigand is fired from B&W and 
Bergman is given anonymous tips by an insider that tobacco companies 
knowingly and willfully put harmful chemicals in their cigarettes to get 
smokers hooked on them.  Even though Wigand has been fired, he hesitates 
to talk to Bergman and reporter Mike Wallace about the company, due to a 
confidentiality clause he signed with B&W, and in fact Wigand finds 
himself under increasing harassment and smear campaign tactics from 
unnamed sources (who he naturally assumes are connected to B&W) to keep 
his mouth shut.  </P>
<P>After Bergman convinces him that Bergman and a group of lawyers he hires 
can protect Wigand, Wigand agrees to be interviewed by Wallace; but that 
confidentiality clause comes back to haunt both men when Bergman, 
Wallace, and Executive Producer Don Hewitt (Phillip Baker Hall) are put 
under pressure by CBS' legal department, led by Helen Caperelli (Gina 
Gershon), to drop Wigand's interview from the "60 Minutes" story.  
Remarkably, the CBS executives do just that, leaving Wigand to suffer 
the smear campaign alone, after his wife Liane (Diane Venora) and 
children leave him.  Bergman, however, has other plans...</P>
<P>The Upshot:
Let me be perfectly frank: I didn't go to see "The Insider" because I'd 
heard it was Da Bomb.  I didn't go because I had 2.5 hours of free time 
on a lonely Saturday night (trust me, I didn't), nor because I had a 
hankerin' to see a Good Guy vs Bad Guy fable.  I'll be straight-up with 
you; I went to see this flick for the same reason that tens of 
Jonny-come-lately critics and moviegoers went to see it after its 
re-release: because it was nominated for an Academy Award.  I'll not put 
forth any illusions that I cared for the tone of this film, for its High 
Moral Stance about the trials and travails of the Little Whistleblower 
versus the Big Bad Tobacco Company in the one corner, and the Evil Media 
Empire in the other.  I mean, to me, this movie rested squarely on the 
same continuum of last year's simple-minded, ridiculously hyped (and 
sheeple-ly watched) Titanic flick: Little Man Blow Whistle.  Big Bad 
Tobacco Company Squash Little Whistleblower. Evil Media Empire Leave 
Little Whistleblower Twisting In Wind. Little Whistleblower Fight Back. 
Good Triumphs Over Evil.  End Of Movie.  And to an extent, that's how 
it's laid out for the viewer.</P>
<P>That extent, of course, doesn't do much justice to the powerhouse 
performances by Pacino, Crowe, and the underappreciated Plummer, an 
actor whose characters always have the same sly grin that a Rottweiler 
might just before he tears you a new one.  Crowe garnered an Oscar 
nomination for his against-type performance, a nod which he richly 
deserved; an Aussie whose next big flick, Gladiator, has him filling 
Kirk Douglas' sandals, Crowe sinks his teeth into this meaty role and 
digs in--even when it gets Weird.  And the aforementioned Pacino puts in 
a solid performance that makes me wonder why he, too, wasn't seriously 
considered for a nomination.  Lack of character flaws aside (though it 
was a central issue for me that both Bergman and Wigand were presented 
as Put-Upon Heros with little culpability), they both did an outstanding 
job in keeping the noticeably-longish movie going smoothly, for the most 
part.  </P>
<P>Michael Mann's direction, on the other hand, tended to get in the way 
for me; while I'm sure there are critics out there, hailing Mann's 
so-close-up-the-nose, you-wanna-grab-a-tissue closeups as the pinnacle 
of cinematic art, I found them as tedious as Weigand's hallucinations 
were laughable.   Mann didn't totally screw the pooch--his artistic use 
of light and shadows, and beautiful shots of the Mississippi coastline, 
really worked for me, as did his general direction of the actors 
themselves.  But those closeups gave me a daggone headache.</P>
<P>As for the movie itself, in the end, it all boils down to this: the 
movie, as good as it may have been, failed to impart a sense of Urgency! 
in me, because of the times we live in in American society.  Crooked 
politicians, slimy lawyers, opportunistic Media outlets, 
morally-bankrupt businesses: they're all part and parcel of The System 
in which we all are trapped; for all its chest-thumping, this movie 
isn't telling us something we don't already know. </P>
<P>As I said earlier, there are far too many characters--and actors--to 
properly attribute from this lengthy film (thus, the addition of 
character names next to the credited actors above but not mentioned in 
the body of this review).  Try as I might, I can't even remember half of 
the characters that the Internet Movie Database lists in starring roles 
(and the Flash-laden official movie site doesn't help much).  But for 
all of the pomp and circumstance surrounding the main players, there's 
one scene late in the movie, involving two character actors playing 
lawyers (one of whom is Wings Hauser, and the other whose name escapes 
me right now, though he's one of those actors whose face you never 
forget) that was the highlight of this flick for me, so much so that I 
find myself often repeating the name-I-forget's memorable line.  Keeping 
this great scene as spoiler-free as I can, I'll summarize it thusly: at 
Weigand's relatively informal hearing in Mississippi, Hauser's 
character, a lawyer for the tobacco interests, continually harangues 
Weigand, telling him he can't break his confidentiality agreement; he 
does this to the objection of name-I-forget, who reminds Hauser's 
character that they aren't in a jury trial and he should just chill.  
Hauser's character, of course, fails to chill, and as their argument 
comes to a head, name-I-forget breaks off with "The Saaavern State 'a 
Mih-sippi is tellin' you to shut! the! hell! up!".  Or something like 
that.</P>
<P>Maybe you had to be there, but it had me rollin'.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
I actually hesitate to bring this up within the context of the BF, 
because the comparison isn't valid strictly along these lines--but since 
I've read it bandied about in many email messages forwarded hither and 
yon, I'm hoping that the inclusion of the comparison within this space, 
will bring an end to the playing of this particular race card:</P>
<P>It's no secret that "The Insider" as well as another current movie based 
on a true story, "The Hurricane" starring Denzel Washington, are 
"burdened" by untruths, if not outright lies, included as "dramatic 
license".  Where "Insider" acknowledged these "fibs" in disclaimers 
displayed in the end credits, "Hurricane" did not, and "Hurricane" 
seemingly suffered the consequences for it, in both bad publicity and, 
likely, in not being given an Oscar nomination.  Some would say that an 
unspoken consideration was the two movie's racial makeup--"Hurricane" 
being, in their eyes, a Black movie.  To that, I say, get over it--and 
remember that Denzel picked up a Best Actor nod for that role.  Fibs and 
all.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
"Tobacco companies put Bad Stuff in cigarettes so that smokers will 
continue to ignore the limp warnings on the ciggy packages, and puff 
until their lungs are coated black with tar?  Noooo, really?  And The 
Media has no backbone, hiding behind The Peoples Right To Know whenever 
it suits them?  Git outta heah, ya gotta be kiddin me!  What's next, 
you'll tell me that "Titanic" was a dumb piece of fluff about a big boat 
that Hit Iceberg, Go Boom?"  Duh, so what's new?</P>
<P>"The Insider" (rating: greenlight):
Good performances that are as much wasted on a "No sh*t, Sherlock" tale.</P>
