<P>In the opening scene of Miyazaki Hayao's animated feature Princess
Mononoke, we witness a battle between young Prince Ashitaka and a
giant demon warthog that is attacking his village. In the act of
successfully killing the animal, he receives a wound to his arm. In a
meeting with the village elders, he learns from a wise woman that the
wound is certainly fatal. It is only a matter of time. His only hope
is to travel to the forest home of the demon warthog to find out what
has driven it to hate and kill humans.</P>
<P>Thus begins a quest that is thematically related to many legends and
fairy tales, going back to the Epic of Gilgamesh. A young protagonist,
usually an adolescent like Ashitaka, goes on a voyage to save either
himself, herself or their people. This voyage--in many ways a rite of
puberty--leads to self-discovery and a happy ending.</P>
<P>Although Miyazaki is known as Japan's Walt Disney, it would be a
mistake to assume that Princess Mononoke resembles the sort of
saccharine product Disney studios offer up today. In many ways it is a
throwback to the darker vision of a Disney past, when his films had
the power to both frighten and enchant.</P>
<P>Ashikata departs to the East on his steed, a loyal elk in true
fairy-tale fashion, the rumored homeland of the demon hog. The only
clue to what drove the animal wild and turned it into a demon is the
iron ball that is discovered in its corpse. The wise woman of the
village tells him that if he discovers the source of the iron ball, he
will likely understand the root of his own suffering as well.</P>
<P>After a journey across mountains and through forests, he finally
arrives at the source of the iron ball. It is Irontown, ruled by
Princess Eboshi. Miyazaki's Irontown is a realistic depiction of one
of those towns that existed everywhere on the cusp of the introduction
of capitalist property relations in the 16th century. Its citizens
work in a foundry turning iron ore into guns and bullets. Eboshi
dreams of ruling the world. By bringing together wage labor and raw
materials, she will achieve mastery over all her enemies, including
the feudal Samurai warriors who are constantly attacking her heavily
fortified industrial compound. She is symbolic of an emerging Japanese
bourgeoisie, whose artisan-based workshop is a mere sprout in the
surrounding feudal countryside. Out of such sprouts, capitalism could
emerge anywhere, but for geographical reasons was allowed only to
emerge in Western Europe and Japan. In the first instance because
Western Europe was able to cannibalize the New World, in the second
because Japan took advantage of its insular features to resist the
cannibals.</P>
<P>Her only other enemy are the animals and spirits of the nearby
mountain, where the town's miners are systematically destroying trees
in order to get at the iron ore under the ground. Periodically
animals, including the warthog of the opening scene, attack the miners
and the soldiers who defend them. That is what the iron ball turns out
to be, a bullet that both gravely wounded the warthog and led to
Ashikata's own struggle against death.</P>
<P>Eboshi's main worry, however, is San, the teenaged girl who lives with
white wolves in the forest. She is Princess Mononoke, who has the
ability to talk to the animals. Her parents abandoned her in the
forest when she was an infant, where she was adopted by the wolf
goddess Moro, her mother now. During one of her raids on Eboshi's
fortress-factory, San is saved from death by Ashikata who takes her
unconscious body back into the forest. During the rescue, he is
wounded himself. Using the restorative powers of a pond deep within
the forest, San brings Ashikata back to health. However, the original
wound he received from the warthog has not disappeared. Its black
magic will prove difficult to overcome. The partnership of Ashikata
and San against the destruction of the forest, set against their
unsteady progress toward friendship and possibly love, will eventually
overcome this black magic.</P>
<P>Besides the three central characters--Princess Mononoke, Ashikata and
Eboshi--the most vivid character of all is the forest itself with its
animals and spirits. Miyazaki is one of the great animation artists of
the 20th century, whose landscapes still depend heavily on manually
produced cels, although he is not above using computers when
appropriate. Every scene in Princess Mononoke is framed by a
breathtaking natural tableaux, typically tree-covered mountains that
arch toward a brilliant sun and clouds, with birds coasting lazily
across the sky. Although the scenes of nature usually occupy less than
a minute, they are essential to the esthetic pleasure of the film and
its underlying theme: nature has transcendent if not divine status. To
kill it in a wanton fashion is evil. On one level, Miyazaki's
environmentalism has much in common with the "deep ecology" that has
sprung up over the past 2 decades. It depends heavily on spiritual and
religious understandings of the connection between humanity and
nature.</P>
<P>Key to understanding the underlying beliefs of Princess Mononoke is
the continuing strength of Shintoism in Japan, the pre-Buddhist
indigenous beliefs. The core of Shintoist mythology revolves around
tales of the sun goddess Amaterasu Omikami, the ancestress of the
Imperial Household. In the beginning, according to Japanese mythology,
a certain number of kami or divine powers simply emerged, and a pair
of kami, Izanagi and Izanami, gave birth to the Japanese islands, as
well as to the kami who became ancestors of the various clans.
Amaterasu, the ruler of Takama no Hara; the moon god Tsukiyomi no
Mikoto; and Susanoo (Susanowo) no Mikoto, the ruler of the nether
regions, were the most important among them.</P>
<P>Shintoist beliefs remain strong in Japan today, although there is no
organized Shintoist religion as such. Perhaps best way to understand
the persistence of precapitalist mythology in a highly advanced
industrial country is to imagine by analogy that Mexico had been an
island able to resist Spanish conquistadores. At some point, the
native Aztec feudal aristocracy emerges into a capitalist class, but
never loses touch with the pantheistic beliefs of its racial origins.
Among them is a belief in the sacredness of nature, something that is
obviously inimical to unfettered capitalist growth.</P>
<P>The concern about "absence of the sacred" not only permeates
Miyazaki's film, it also is strong among some of the ideological
leaders of the recent Seattle protests. Green idealists such as Jerry
Mander and Vandana Shiva decry the soulless pursuit of profit by the
modern corporation. Salvation would seem to be a return to the simple
life of pastoral villagers and nomads, who view themselves as part of
nature and not above it.</P>
<P>However, a deeper reading of Princess Mononoke would yield a somewhat
different view. Prince Ashikata's message is not that Irontown should
be destroyed, only that it find a way to co-exist with nature. In
addition, the artisans of Irontown are depicted as plucky and
resourceful, not simple wage slaves who hate their work. The most
skilled workers there, who are designing a more powerful rifle
directly under Eboshi's supervision, are lepers whom she has rescued
from outer society's fears and superstitions.</P>
<P>In a perceptive Oct. 24, 1999 Los Angeles Times profile of Miyazaki,
Charles Solomon notes that in contrast to the sneering Clayton in
"Tarzan" or the brutal Shan Yu in "Mulan":</P>
<P>"Eboshi is not a straightforward villain. Like the Japanese people
after World War II, the workers in Iron Town are trying to survive in
a troubled world; they don't mean to destroy their environment. 'If
you portray someone who's evil, then you off him, what's the point?'
Miyazaki asked. 'It's easy to create a villain who's a maniacal real
estate developer, then kill him and have a happy ending. But what if a
really good person becomes a real estate developer?'"</P>
<P>The questions posed by Princess Mononoke and the Seattle protests will
remain with us as long as the world is organized on the basis of
profit and private property. Some people opposed to the system will
long for simpler, precapitalist foundations while others will argue
that progress and material well-being can only be ensured by
relentless exploitation of natural resources. Marxism has often found
itself struggling to define itself within the two poles.</P>
<P>Perhaps Engels' characterization of the Iroquois confederacy and other
precapitalist societies might be a guide to understanding resolving
this apparent dilemma:</P>
<P>"The power of this primitive community had to be broken, and it was
broken. But it was broken by influences which from the very start
appear as a degradation, a fall from the simple moral greatness of the
old gentile society. The lowest interests -- base greed, brutal
appetites, sordid avarice, selfish robbery of the common wealth --
inaugurate the new, civilized, class society. It is by the vilest
means -- theft, violence, fraud, treason -- that the old classless
gentile society is undermined and overthrown. And the new society
itself, during all the two and a half thousand years of its existence,
has never been anything else but the development of the small minority
at the expense of the great exploited and oppressed majority; today it
is so more than ever before."</P>
<P>Clearly, what Marxists should aim at is the marriage of the values of
communal society--including its reverence of nature--with the
scientific and technological advances that modern class society has
made possible. The proper term for this is socialism.</P>
