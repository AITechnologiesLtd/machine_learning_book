                       A film review by Zak Forsman
                        Copyright 1996 Zak Forsman</PRE>
<P>"Loneliness has followed me my whole life. Everywhere. In bars and cars,
sidewalks, stores--everywhere. There's no escape. I'm God's lonely man." We
listen to Travis Bickle, played by Robert DeNiro, as he watches the night
people on 42nd avenue from inside his taxi. "All the animals come out at
night," he says. It is at this particular moment when we realize that
Martin Scorsese's TAXI DRIVER is not a film about a psychotic, it is not a
film about a pervert, but a film about a lonely man in a city full of
people.</P>
<P>Over twenty years ago screenwriter, Paul Schrader, was in a terrible state. He'd
divorced his wife, left the American Film Institute and his career as a
film critic was waning. Schrader found himself living out of his car and
going to pornography theaters daily. Suffering from extreme pain in his
abdomen he went to an emergency room. It was there that Schrader realized
that he hadn't spoken to another person in three weeks. He began to see
his car as a kind of steel coffin and recognized that a taxi driver shares
a similar situation. Schrader quickly settled on his main character and
wrote the first and second drafts of the screenplay in ten days as a
personal catharsis, borrowing heavily from his own experiences.</P>
<P>What fascinates me about TAXI DRIVER is the complexity of character that arises
from a fairly simple story. Travis is obsessed with two women. Betsy (Cybil
Shepherd) is the woman he desires but cannot have. And twelve-year-old
Iris (Jodie Foster) is the prostitute he can have, but does not desire. In
his frustration over the men who seemingly control and can have these
women, Travis attempts to kill the Senator/father-figure of one, fails and
kills the pimp/father-figure of the other. And because he is lucky, Travis
is regarded a hero. Along the way we see the plan growing in his head
within scenes that keep that fact in the background--almost like an
undercurrent. One of the more memorable scenes has director Martin
Scorsese as one of Travis' passengers who lays out his plan to murder his
adulterous wife with a .44 Magnum. It is here that the idea of violent
action is planted in Travis' head and until the film's climax we watch it
grow. "I've got a lot of bad ideas in my head," he admits with a nervous
smile. Again, what has truly happened in this scene is not spoon-fed to us
which in result engages our minds. This is the difference
between great cinema and the standard Hollywood fare. This film respects its
audience.</P>
<P>As does Robert DeNiro of his character. DeNiro is so far into Travis
Bickle we stop seeing him as DeNiro. We forget he's acting. He's one of
few actors that can convincingly disappear inside their character. Travis
is obsessed and DeNiro knows this. Travis has trouble relating to women
and DeNiro knows this. Travis can sometimes be unaware that he's in his
own world. DeNiro knows this. In one scene some other cabbies are talking
and one asks Travis how he's doing. Travis slowly replies, "What's that?"
Then he goes on to tell a story about another taxi driver that was cut up
by a knife-wielding madman. What's important here is the look on DeNiro's
face when he first replies. Travis wasn't daydreaming and he isn't slow.
He's been floating around the city in his "steel coffin" all the while
living in his own moral universe. That's where Travis is coming from and
as I said, Robert DeNiro knows this. A great performance like this comes
down to trust in character. And honesty.</P>
<P>The best way to describe director Martin Scorsese's ability is with a
scene in TAXI DRIVER when Travis is standing in a hallway and talking to
Betsy on a pay-phone. He is apologizing to her for bringing her to an
X-rated movie on their date the night before. When he asks if she received
the flowers he sent, she tells him she didn't. The director's camera
tracks to the right and stops on a shot of an empty hallway. Scorsese has
said that he did this because it is as though Travis' rejection is too
painful to watch. It moves away. Apparently even harder to watch than the
violence at the film's climax. I must admit I find this motivation for
camera movement fascinating and it is for reasons like this that I feel
Martin Scorsese is our greatest director. He has an obvious and important
signature, most Hollywood directors don't.</P>
<P>TAXI DRIVER is a film about character. Schrader's dialogue for, DeNiro's
understanding of and Scorsese's attention to this character come together
brilliantly. Twenty years ago this film was up for Best Picture at the
Academy Awards and it won the International Grand Prize at the Cannes film
festival. And I'm sure you've realized by now that I highly recommend you
see TAXI DRIVER.</P>
