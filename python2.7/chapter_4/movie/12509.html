<P>   The next time someone tells you that irradiated food is
harmless, send him to this movie.  And if he doesn't get
around to seeing it, no problem: you can be sure there will be
a "Godzilla 2," or more accurately a "Godzilla 24," within two
years.  Though the well-known leapin' lizard never gained the
popularity here of E.T., he has been the subject of over a
score of films, mostly Japanese.  They're the pictures which
those of us lucky to be of a certain age thrilled to as early as
the 1954 Japanese production "Gojira" directed by Terry
Morse and starring Ishiro Honda and Takashi Shimura, with
Raymond Burr later added as an insert for the American
crowds.  To no-one's surprise, critics agreed that the special
effects were the star in that one.  Nothing's changed, nor
does TriStar attempt to market the current version as a
character-driven story, unless, you of course, you consider a
big green guy to be a character.  Come to think of it, Godzilla
himself is about the only believable character in the picture.
He's certainly larger than life and acts better than Matthew
Broderick, also to no one's surprise.</P>
<P>   There's much to admire here, however.  For one thing
there's the fact that you can blame the overgrown lizard on
French and not American nuclear testing.  For another,
there's an attempt at humor (there aren't many) by featuring
Roger Ebert lookalike Michael Lerner as Mayor Ebert, a
grandiose political animal whose comeuppance arrives near
the end when his campaign chief gives him the big thumbs
down sign.  The fact that a good deal of Manhattan Island is
destroyed is either good or bad depending on your
geopolitical nature, though to appease real New Yorkers,
Madison Square Garden comes in for total destruction as
well.  Yet another plus is the presence of Jean Reno,
allegedly a French insurance investigator who, along with
Godzilla, is the only credible performer--one whose antipathy
toward American coffee and American doughnuts holds water
and proves that two things in France are better than what
we've got over here.</P>
<P>   Filmed in Hawaii to stand in for French Polynesia and also
on location in New Jersey, New York and California,
"Godzilla" opens on a French nuclear test, whose mushroom
cloud is looked upon with fascination by three cute lizzies.
(Why only one mutates into the big beast is anyone's guess.) 
Shortly thereafter, research scientist Dr. Niko Tatopoulos
(Matthew Broderick), aka "the worm guy," is whisked away by
State Department personnel from his Ukraine project
investigating fat earthworms in Chernobyl to advise a group of
military planners, politicians and scholars on a sushi-loving
creature that has wreaked havoc with a Japanese fishing boat
in Polynesia.  He soon meets up with Audrey (Maria Pitillo), a
former sweetheart who walked out on him eight years before,
and with her two friends Luci (Arabella Field) and Victor (Hank
Azaria), who work for a TV news station bossed by Charles
Caiman (Harry Shearer).  Advising the military that it's better
to have the creature come to them than to try to dig him out
of his New York hiding place, he gathers up thousands of fish
as bait from the Fulton fish market and awaits the return.  His
reappearance provides just what the audience has been
waiting for: the destructive force of a dragon-like heathen
who, when he a tail unfolds, sweeps out one hundred
windows on an upper floor of an office building and whose
mighty claw crushes many of those who do not have a
starring role in the movie.  Meanwhile, Mayor Ebert has
probably given up on the idea that anyone in his town will
adopt the creature.  After all, where would you get a pooper-
scooper that's the right size?</P>
<P>   Though the company claims to have re-invented the
Godzilla legend by use of cutting-edge technology, the picture
does not look a whole lot different from the one the Japanese
made forty-four years ago.  For good or evil, the kitsch is
gone.  Godzilla does look almost real, thanks to modern CGI
(computer graphics imagery) that's de rigueur with high-tech
companies that want you to buy a new model each year, but
when he growls and moans, we feel kind of sorry for him.  It's
an E.T. thing.  The guy didn't ask to be born like this and you
can't blame him for leaving French territory where he would
have been condemned--as Woody "Love and Death" Allen
would say--to spend his life eating croissants and food with
rich sauces.  He did not travel by foot all the way to
Manhattan to see the movie "Godzilla," nor was he much
interested in Knicks games despite his visit to Madison
Square Garden. And after all, he was probably aiming to get
lawyers, not innocent people, when he swished out those
windows around the Flatiron building and coaxed the military
to bomb the Chrysler building.   </P>
<P>  Like Beethoven's Fifth, "Godzilla" has more than one ending. 
In the most dramatic, the lizard stages a one-day strike
against a taxi, showing how easy it is to catch a cab in
Manhattan if you're assertive enough.</P>
<P>   To show sympathy or animosity toward the creature, huge
audiences will surely throng to the 7,000+ screens in the U.S.
for its opening on May 20, folks who might well overlook the
competing "Bulworth" making its nationwide debut two days
later.  Never mind that Mayor Ebert cannot match wits in the
slightest with Senator Jay Billington Bulworth--the best
Hizzoner can do is to scream that evacuated New Yorkers
should be let back into the city even while the monster is
taking his paces in midtown.  </P>
<P>   Matthew Broderick, who shows empathy for Godzilla
despite his frequent, frightened, wide-eyed gaze each time the
monster approaches, is still Ferris Bueller--the boy next door
you'd love to set up with your adorable, curly-haired blond
daughter.  The only human show-stopper here is Jean Reno
as French agent Philippe Roache, still donning that four-day
beard, whom you will recognize from his dazzling role in Luc
Besson's "The Professional." He's the man who puts an
artistic touch on the movie by forcing director Roland
Emmerich to insert French subtitles.  He does a mean job
with a southern American accent as well.</P>
<P>   Maybe New York, the country's most liberal big city, should
rethink its mission to allow visitors in without regard to size,
color, or manner of birth.  Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 139
minutes.  (C) 1998 Harvey Karten</P>
