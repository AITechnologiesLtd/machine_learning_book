<PRE>THE PRINCE OF EGYPT
Review By Victory A. Marasigan</PRE>
<P>NOTE: This review and an interview with Dreamworks SKG's Jeffrey
Katzenberg and the makers THE PRINCE OF EGYPT can be found at:

<P>The concept for DreamWorks SKG's _The Prince of Egypt_ doesn't
sound like subject matter ripe for the animated-movie treatment. The film
retells the Biblical story of Exodus, the same one told in DeMille's
expansive epic _The Ten Commandments_. A "cartoon" about plague and
pestilence, infant murders, and the drowning of hundreds of soldiers? Is
DreamWorks crazy?</P>
<P>Such reservations can thankfully be put to rest, because the resulting
film is one of the most touching and emotionally uplifting versions of the
story yet depicted. DreamWork's version of this oft-told tale offers a
vulnerable Moses, as compared to Charlton Heston's famous
chiseled-out-of-stone take on the character.  Gaunt and rather
unintimidating, this Moses (voiced by Val Kilmer) has the rebellious
demeanor and zeal that any young soul might have. </P>
<P>The film's bold, sweeping opening sequence (underscored by the wondrous
choral cry "Deliver Us") shows us Moses' legendary beginnings, as his
desperate mother sends him adrift on the Nile to escape the Pharaoh's
(Patrick Stewart)  murderous soldiers. Ironically, this action brings the
Hebrew infant into the care of the Pharaoh's family. Raised like the
Pharaoh's own, Moses grows up unaware of his true heritage. He develops a
strong bond with the Pharaoh's son Rameses (Ralph Fiennes, in the most
convincing and heartbreaking of the film's characterizations). Moses' life
is turned on its end when, soon after being declared prince, he meets his
true siblings (voiced by Sandra Bullock and Jeff Goldblum), who reveal to
him his slave heritage. This truth is too much for the young man; without
explanation, he leaves his father's kingdom behind, unsure of his destiny. </P>
<P>For the animators, envisioning a story set in ancient Egypt seems to have
been like discovering a treasure-filled mummy's tomb. The majestic
Egyptian city, with its oversize temples and skyscraping statues, looks
like an elaborate chessboard, with pieces which may have been laid there
by the hands of the Gods themselves. The rich color in the temples'
hypostyle halls, the painted limestone reliefs, the glare of the
unforgiving sunlight -- all details which pull us into the reality of that
beautiful place. </P>
<P>Moses' journey eventually brings him into contact with God Himself, who
empowers him to return to his kingdom and let his people go. The miracles
Moses helps bring about, from the invasion of swarms of insects to the
fiery finger of God, dazzle with a beauty which is believable without
being photorealistic. And let's not forget _the_ miracle -- the parting of
the Red Sea -- which features astounding, breathtaking visual effects. </P>
<P>Though Moses finds love and marriage in the desert, the film is really
more interested in the relationship between him and Rameses. The latter
experiences a tragic fall due to his own blindness, but his caring for his
brother remains solid throughout the film. And so, Rameses becomes one of
the most sympathizable "bad guys"  ever to be depicted in an animated
movie. </P>
<P>So who is the audience for this film? The way the story is told, a person
need not be familiar with nor even believe in the Biblical stories to be
moved by it. Younger children can sit through the film and not be fully
aware of the scope of the horrors being inferred. Inspiring and
transporting, _The Prince of Egypt_ is an experience believers and
non-believers alike should not miss.</P>
