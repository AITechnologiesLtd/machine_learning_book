<PRE>                           THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS
                       A film review by Anton Panagos
                        Copyright 1991 Anton Panagos</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Jonathan Demme                        </PRE>
<P>     Jonathan Demme creates a horrifying and gruesome story of two
serial killers.  One is an imprisoned and demented psychiatrist,
Hannibal "the cannibal" Lecter and the other is a serial killer on the
loose, Buffalo Bill.  </P>
<P>     Lecter is visited in his maximum-security cell by a young FBI
agent-in-training, Clarisse (played by Jodie Foster).  Clarisse had been
sent by her boss and trainer (played by Scott Glenn).  Lecter was jailed
for committing heinous crimes including cannibalism, hence the
nickname.  Clarisse's objective is to retrieve information from a
psychopath like Lecter in order catch Buffalo Bill.  Lecter is helpful,
at first.  But Clarisse is dealing with a highly intelligent and clever
criminal.</P>
<P>     On the other hand, Buffalo Bill is a serial killer who skins his
victims.  He kidnaps the daughter of a senator in West Virginia.  The
minute the news hits the FBI agency in Washington,DC, Clarisse offers a
"vacation" plan to Lecter as a supposed bribe.  The chase for Buffalo
Bill goes on from here.  Meanwhile problems occur with  Lecter after he
is transferred to a temporary cell ordered by his  officer-in-charge.  </P>
<P>     There are some explicit scenes of victims and of extreme violence
in this film.  The film lets us look into the mind of a serial killer.
There are many surprises and a heart-pounding ending in this
well-executed and mind-numbing movie.  The cinematography and music help
set the dark mood.  Anthony Hopkins performs  Hannibal Lecter to the
hilt.  It is the best acting performance of 1991, so far.  Hopkins
should be a shoo-in for a nomination for next year's Oscar awards.
Jodie Foster does a competent job as a FBI agent who learns very quickly
how dangerous her job can be.  Overall, "Silence of the Lambs" is
definately one of the best thrillers in a few years.  </P>
