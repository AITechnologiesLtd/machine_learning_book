<P>   Remember this? "Why'd she have to go/I don't know/She
wouldn't say/I said something wrong/Now I long for
yesterday."  Don't we all?  Time marches inexorably on. As
we get older, the days seem to spin by at an ever-increasing
clip.  How we long to go back to the past and change the
ways we messed up.  We could have studied harder, pursued
that special person more ardently, had a different career,
expressed the love for our parents that we never had time to
do.  Some cynics say that if we could go back in time, we'd
wind up doing the same things, making the same mistakes,
and ending up pretty much as we do now--although an
outstanding new sci-fi movie tells us that we could have had
a lot more money if we only knew one word..."Yahoo."  </P>
<P>   This new movie is Gregory Hoblit's "Frequency," one with a
more modest premise.  Here, a 36-year-old man does not
actually go back to the past to test these theories, but he is
able to communicate with the most important person in his
life, his dad.  By knowing the way his father died, he is able
to save his father's life, not once but twice.  But in doing this
he pays a price.  Because the older man survives,
unforeseen disasters occur, jeopardizing the lives of several
women including the young man's mom.  By manipulating a
series of intricate, keen, and credible twists and turns,
director Hoblit utilizes a crackerjack script by Tony Emmerich
and some conscientious performances to fashion a film that
is rich in surprises, tension, and cinematic wonder.  With
fireballs, explosions, a brilliant solar storm and a pulsating
soundtrack, "Frequency" is "Armageddon" with a brain. 
"Frequency" is a multi-layered film wonderfully combining the
themes of father-son relations, working-class culture, and a
spooky murder motif.  The razzle-dazzle camerawork doesn't
simply show the radio conversations between dad in 1969
and son in 1999 with the expected split-screen effect but
shoots the two characters as would a multi-camera TV show--
which significantly ups the already frenetic pace.</P>
<P>   Instead of delving into character development the usual
way, Hoblit shows us pretty much all we need to know about
fire fighter Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid) straight away. He is
a hero who plunges into a New York sewer to rescue a man
trapped inside.  As gasoline spills about the ground, with
electrical wiring about to convert an entire city block to a
blazing inferno, Frank ignores orders to clear out.  He
completes the rescue.  Frank is a idol not only in the eyes of
the NYPD: his home life is a dream with a loving wife, Julia
(Elizabeth Mitchell) and a cute six-year-old, Johnny (Daniel
Henson).  The dream becomes a nightmare when Frank is
killed in a warehouse fire.  Thirty years after his death, his
son John (Jim Caviezel) discovers an old ham radio just after
a solar storm has lit up the sky and, plugging it in, he finds
that he can communicate with the world of 1969 and talk to
his father one day before Frank's tragic death.  John saves
the man's life, altering destiny.</P>
<P>   At this point, the usual sci-fi movie might come to a happy
conclusion, father and son perhaps finding a way to meet
across time.  In this particularly resourceful story, however,
dad's deliverance leads to a chain reaction of disasters, as a
serial killer changes his plans to go specifically after John's
mom, dad, and even John himself.</P>
<P>   Our emotions are orchestrated in many ways throughout
this movie's bold feats of imagination.  As we eavesdrop on
the conversations between John and Frank, we root for them
to communicate with each other in a way that would not
previously have been possible given that John was only six
years old when his father perished.  At the same time, we get
an insight into people who are the real heroes of our time--
not the yuppies of Bret Easton Ellis's "American Psycho" who
make a fortune shuffling papers nor, I fear, the educators
who bore their students in schools and colleges.  The
superstars are the people who make our lives safe from
crime and natural disaster--specifically the fire fighters and
the police.  (Strange, isn't it, that when we were kids and
asked what we wanted to be when we grew up, we'd
inevitably say "cop" or "fireman"?  Do you know a six year old
who would opt to be a stockbroker?)  Finally, Hoblit layers in
the crime strain.  A serial killer is on the loose, getting away
with the murders of ten nurses, living out his life in obscurity
in a New York outer borough.  Through the advantages of an
old fashioned radio--and not via the flair of modern tools of
forensic science or even a computer--a gray-haired assassin
is warned that justice will be served: not in 1999 when the
villain has already lived his life, but in 1969!  Side roles serve
the plot well, particularly that of Satch, a police detective
(Andre Braugher), a long-term friend of Frank who believes
that his pal is guilty of murder.  Hoblit has also captured
some good file footage of the 1969 World Series, showing his
viewers what the Amazin' Mets were capable of doing back
then.</P>
<P>   Several factors add to the movie's credibility in addition to
the choice performances of Caviezel and Quaid--who do not
look like father and son but whose chemistry together belies
that appearance.  Photographer Alar Kivilo films pretty much
on location--in Bayside, Queens and in Brooklyn
neighborhoods including Red Hook; while costume designer
Elisabetta Beraldo has kept busy displaying contrasts
between 1969 outfits and those of the present, including the
distinct uniforms donned by fire fighters during the Nixon
administration.  Toby Emmerich is the big surprise.  The head
of New Line Cinema's Music division for five years, Emmerich
has penned this blockbuster as his very first screenplay. (For
those who think that a good liberal education rather than
simply film school is unimportant, we emphasize that
Emmerich graduated from Wesleyan Phi Beta Kappa with
honors in English and a concentration in Classics and Film.)</P>
<P>   The production notes give the impression that not only is
Emmerich's screenplay and Hoblit's direction beautifully
meshed to make the action believable, but that time travel is
indeed possible even if such a journey is not within our
capabilities at present.  Given credibility, solid performances,
and dazzling effects, "Frequency" is this year's sci-fi film to
catch.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 118 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
