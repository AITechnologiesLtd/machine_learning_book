<P>Dracula films, have always been on the edge of showing people what exactly
they feared in their time.  During the BELA LUGOSI era, the film dealt with
the shadows and things that just seemed to lurk everywhere, which would
scare people, specially when film was such a new adventure.  By the 50's and
60's when we were introduced to the awesome battles between CHRISTOPHER LEE,
and PETER CUSHING, the films begun to take on a new tone, that of the gory
details of death, and the more sexually promiscuous side of things.  And for
the 90's, the film story has progressed from the gory and the specially
disgusting, to the elements which we understand very little of, but which
are a big part of it all.  This Dracula, has desires, and his shadow lives
them, right in front of us, though these bits are subtle, but obvious.  He
also has something which the novel does not get into.  He is now a full
story, a true love story, as opposed to an evil entity, who has an acute
thirst for life.</P>
<P>The novel by Abraham Stoker, is exceptional, in that it is a series of diary
letters between Jonathan Harker, Lucy and Mina Murray.  And what brings
Dracula to London, is not quite clear, since the story is never seen from
the Count's point of view.  This film, almost exclusively, lets us know the
story from the Count's feelings, and what has led him to London, which was
undoubtedly his inner feeling that he had to move, only to discover that the
reason to move to London was because the incarnation of his beloved is the w
oman who is about to marry the real estate agent who is closing the deals on
Carfax Abbey.</P>
<P>All of a sudden we have a love story, and when the injured Count finally
asks his beloved to 'save' his life, she does, and releases him to the
spheres.  The new problem is that Mina will not be able to have
a satisfying life with her beloved, but the chances that a sequel will
follow are nil, and none.  The Count's tale is over, though he has not been
able to meet up with his beloved as he wished.</P>
<P>In many ways, it was a sign of things to come, if this were the novel that
Abraham ( Bram ) Stoker wrote.  The lessons of love are no longer dependant
on the past lives, and the beings merely interact without thought to
anything else.  Were they able to do so, their lives would be fulfilled and
much more satisfying than what is evident.</P>
<P>In between, the film pretty much dwells on the part of the Count which we
can least explain, or understand.  The novel always suggested his bat, wolf,
and mist life ( quite a shaman ), but never could delve very much into it.
This film, unlike the previous ones, gets into it full blast, even if it
isn't quite right.  Lucy is being ravaged in a dream stupor, by a being that
looks like a wolf, and she is enjoying it.  The feral Count is insatiable,
and does what it has to, so it can get to his real target, which in this
film is Mina.</P>
<P>The other well done thing in this film, is that it finally, for the first
time, looks at the country side, and London, as it may have appeared, at the
time of the turn of the century, rather than the almost/quasi
medieval look which it always had in the many films prior to this one.  We
see the trains, and a much more modern London, with an upper class  that is
entering the 20th century, rather than earlier in time.  And this upper
crust of a class has some education, and is less driven by emotional
standards, which the other films worked on in detail.   Lugosi's film
appears very dated.  Lee's films always had a bit of the  18th and 19th
centuries feeling to them and never delved beyond that.  ( I have never
found the Spanish version of DRACULA with CHRISTOPHER LEE, which is said to
be 100% like the book, with absolutely no deviations.. directed by the famed
director Mario Bava. )</P>
<P>With an excellent cast, and well directed, this film is actually less scary
than it is beautiful to watch.  Excellent music replaces the shock horror
classic music of the likes of Charles Martell and company that always scared
us in the Hammer Films.  And a superb costume and make up job, keeps us very
much wondering what will come next, which is actually a pleasant surprise
next to the other films.  And yes, unlike the previous films, there is also
a bit more skin to be shown in this film.  But it is well done, and never
mis-used.</P>
