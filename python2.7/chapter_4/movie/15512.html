<PRE>ONE TOUGH COP
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>If you couldn't tell by the title, One Tough Cop is about, well, one
tough cop.  It's a by-the-numbers cop drama filled to the gills with
generic characters, generic situations and generic dialogue.</P>
<P>Stephen Baldwin stars as NYPD detective Bo Dietl...supposedly a
legendary NY cop, but who apparently did nothing noteworthy enough to
include in a film (everything except Dietl's name has no basis in
fact).  If you've ever seen a cop movie, or watched a police drama on
TV, you know Dietl's type...the gruff but loyal cop who isn't ashamed to
bend the rules as long as justice gets done.</P>
<P>What's a cop without a doomed partner?  In this case, the walking stiff
is "Duke" (portrayed by Chris Penn).  At least, Duke isn't three days
away from retiring and sailing around the world on a yacht named
"Live-4-Ever"...One Tough Cop has standards, you know. Instead, Duke is
saddled with a hefty gambling debt and a pathetic John Wayne
impersonation.  If he didn't already have a huge red bullseye painted on
his chest, you'd probably be eager to paint one there.</P>
<P>Bo and Duke's alleged case is catching a pair of bad guys who raped and
mutilated a nun.  Besides providing a few lurid and distasteful shots,
the actual crime doesn't really matter here. Even Bo and Duke's "unique"
path to solving it is rather straightforward and uninteresting.</P>
<P>What does provide a little spice to the proceedings, however, is the
fact that Bo's best friend, Richie La Cassa (Mike McGlone), just happens
to be a mafia boss.  Bo doesn't see that as a conflict... neither with
his job, nor with sleeping with Richie's girlfriend, Joey (Gina
Gershon).</P>
<P>That love triangle is about as complex as the screenplay here ever gets.
Granted, that might be enough basis for an interesting movie...but not
here, not with this screenplay.  The dialogue seems cut and paste from a
thousand different sources.  You can almost mouth the words along with
the actors, they're so familiar.</P>
<P>Stephen Baldwin takes his stock character and goes nowhere with it.
Perhaps the crackle and pizzazz of a stronger actor might have been able
to get mileage out of this treadless role, but not Baldwin.  True, he
huffs and puffs right on cue, and spouts the necessary dialogue at the
familiar times, but nowhere does he try to take the role anywhere new.</P>
<P>The best praise I can lay on One Tough Cop is that, as far as
cookie-cutter cop dramas go, it doesn't really make any missteps.
However, it doesn't make much of a case for going to the movies, either.</P>
