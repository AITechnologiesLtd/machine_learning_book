<PRE>The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999)

<P>Why did everyone love The Talented Mr. Ripley?  I can't understand.  Simply 
put up front, I hated The Talented Mr. Ripley.  I thought it was a bore and 
it was nothing special.</P>
<P>Mr. Ripley is Tom Ripley (Matt Damon).  Ripley is a loser who would rather 
be a fake somebody than a real nobody.  Ripley is also a good impersonator 
and is a gifted liar.  As the film opens Ripley meets the parents of Dickie 
Greenleaf (Jude Law).  Dickie's father asks Ripley if he would like to go 
to Italy to get his son Dickie to return to the states.  It seems that 
Dickie has been living off his father's money in Italy with his girlfriend 
Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow) and has no plans on returning.  Well, Ripley finds 
someone he really wants to be, Dickie.  Dickie is outgoing, personably, and 
extroverted.  Everything Ripley wants.  And a plus is that Dickie's 
girlfriend is not bad either.</P>
<P>I can see how The Talented Mr. Ripley can be an interesting film on someone 
taking someone else identity.  But, writer/director Anthony Minghella does 
it in such a way that I was looking at my watch multiple times during the 
film, I even got up once to look at the DVD jacket to see what the running 
time of the film was (a whopping 2 hours and 20 minutes if you're 
curious).  The sinker for the film isn't bad acting, the three main actors, 
including Damon, are great.  The sinker for the film is the pace.  When the 
murderous dark side of Ripley is shown, it is already past half the 
film.  The first half of the film is sheer boredom.  The second half of the 
film is sheer silliness.  The Talented Mr. Ripley is not what everyone 
says, it's not what the big critics say it is.  This is not a great film, 
it is rather a meandering snore fest with an ending that left me somewhat 
upset that I sat through the whole film.</P>
<P>As I mentioned before, the actors all do wonderful jobs with their 
parts.  Damon shows that he really can act and takes the lead role and 
injects some flair into it.  Damon does well with the Mr. Ripley role as a 
man who is truly confused with what he is and what he has done.  Jude Law 
whom I last saw in the terrible eXistenZ does better in this film (of 
course anything is better then that gore-fest eXistenZ).  Actually, Law 
does quite well in the film portraying the spoiled boy who can only show 
his affection to one person at a time.  And Paltrow does very well as the 
girlfriend who finds out more than she should have and which no one 
believes.  The actors in The Talented Mr. Ripley are great, too bad they 
didn't have a better film to carry their talents to the audience.</P>
<P>Maybe I was being a bit brutal with The Talent Mr. Ripley by saying that I 
hated it.  I dislike the film a lot, but I can't give it a Skip, Skip, Skip 
rating.  The acting talents in the film are too much and if on the off 
chance there is nothing of interest at the rental place, try out The 
Talented Mr. Ripley if you're a patient person and would like to see some 
good acting.  Else, try as hard as you can to find something else to watch, 
there are lots of movies out there that better entertain you for 2 hours 
and 20 minutes than this silly film.</P>
