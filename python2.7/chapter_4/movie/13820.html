<P>   If you were a married woman, would you invite your former
lover and his girl friend to your home?  If so, maybe you
never saw Edward Albee's play, "Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf," which features an alcohol-soaked battle royale
between two couples with host George doing his utmost to
humiliate his wife Martha and his guests Nick and Honey. 
You've got to wonder, then, what was going through the mind
of Nancy (Bonnie Bedelia), a tenured college professor, who
invites her former beau Matt (Saul Rubinek) and Matt's sexy
girl friend Kim (Caroleen Feeney) to her Cambridge home. 
Did she have any idea what effect such an engagement
would have on herself and her husband Wes (David
Strathairn)?  There are many such puzzles in Jonathan
Kaufer's movie, with a screenplay by David Gilman--based on
his 1993 play "Ghost in the Machine."   Appropriately enough,
the staged comedy/drama was performed by Chicago's
Steppenwolf Company, a repertory group known for its
visceral dramatizations.  Translated quite effectively to the
screen, "Bad Manners," which is loosely modeled after "Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf,"actually improves upon that classic
tale of marital breakdown with verbal pyrotechnics and
in-your-face audacity.  If this sort of story is your favorite
genre--the kind of narrative that explores the implosion of
relationships rather than explosions of planets--you'd be
strongly advised to see Neil LaBute's "Your Friends &
Neighbors" as well.</P>
<P>   The question that consumes viewers as they watch the
story unfold is "Why the heck didn't the host and hostess kick
their guests out long before the fireworks petered out?"  If so,
remember that the essence of intimate drama is a
performance involving two or more people physically or
psychologically trapped in a room, playing out their conflicts
and obsessions.  In this essentially four-piece chess game
Wes is a childless, forty-something academic married to
Nancy, who has established herself in the teaching
profession.  She has tenure: Wes is in an acerbic mood,
having just been passed over for tenure at a woman's
finishing school.  The two are playing host to Nancy's old
flame, Matt, a now pudgy musicologist who is enjoying a
relationship with his much younger research assistant, Kim--a
smart, arrogant, seductive computer whiz.  Matt is in town to
deliver a lecture at Harvard on a contemporary composer,
Vinh Schuman, in whose 12-tone composition he has
discovered a direct musical quotation from a work by the 15th
Century theologian, Martin Luther.  Since there is no way that
the Vietnamese composer could have come across that
medieval work, Matt holds that that quote must have been
implanted by God and seeks to establish a reputation by
publishing a paper on his discovery.  The audience is asked
to consider that perhaps the playful Kim had doctored the
tape to ruin Matt's career.</P>
<P>   The agitation begins when Wes discovers that he's $50
short and tells his wife that he suspects Kim as the thief. 
Wes has Nancy stealthily remove $50 from Kim's purse and
begins the night of clever word games by suggesting to
Nancy that if Kim does not bring up her own loss of $50, it is
because she had stolen the money and is embarrassed to
report it.  When Kim does report the loss, Wes counters with
a round of "You know that I know that you know" and Kim
retaliates with her own bloc of word games.  As the alcoholic-
soaked night continues--the guests occasionally coupling off
with their hosts--Kim comes on seductively to Wes and
the accusations fly.  So do the protestations of innocence. 
Allegations and rebuttals drift so freely that even Ken Starr
would have serious doubts as to which statements were
accurate and which were spurious. The audience is left to
ponder the same dilemma, to sort out the events of the
evening and indict the parties as it chooses.</P>
<P>   The actors mine the taut, lacerating script with unflagging
ardor.  David Strathairn is perfect as the repressed, caustic
teacher who takes quite a bit of time to ignite, while Bonnie
Bedelia effectively transforms from a smug, married woman to
a questioning and more liberated femme.  Saul Rubinek, who
has seen thinner days, is at his best when in conference with
his would be publisher (played by Julie Harris), changing from
full-of-himself pomposity to utter defeat when given the
publishing board's opinion of his article.  Best of all is the
chain-smoking Caroleen Feeney, previously seen to great
advantage in "Denise Calls Up."  Though the chain-smoker
probably smells like an ash tray, we can understand the utter
powerlessness of men to avoid her enticing charms.  As the
old song goes, "Cigarettes and whiskey and wild wild women,/
They'll drive you crazy, they'll drive you insane."</P>
