<P>Someone once wrote that in order to preserve liberty, freedom may have
to be suspended occasionally and someone wrote back that he who would
suspend freedom for the sake of liberty deserves neither liberty or
freedom.  Interesting semantics.  In my country, Canada, we had a
national crisis in 1970 when a group of separatists using terrorist
tactics and who kidnapped and murdered a government official, were
rounded up when our Prime Minister used the war powers act and order was
quickly restored.  I happen to agree with that call simply because civil
liberties are already suspended so why not put that power in the hands
of people who are trying to restore order rather than the ones who try
and take it away.</P>
<P>In 'The Siege', not only is martial law brought to the forefront for the
prevention of terrorism, but it also shows that no solution is perfect.
The film is a good mix of domestic law enforcement countered by the
debate of what measures are acceptable in fighting terrorism.</P>
<P>Director Edward Zwick ('Glory', 'Legends of the Fall' and 'Courage Under
Fire') has crafted a suspenseful and meticulously loud batch of social
commentary to get this debate under way.  Denzel Washington stars as an
FBI agent in New York City who works to combat recent acts of terrorism
popping up all over the Big Apple.  He meets a covert (oops!, not
anymore) CIA operator (Annette Bening) investigating the terrorism from
a clandestine approach to the situation and eventually the two of them
work together.  The terrorism unfolds as the U.S. holds a middle eastern
leader as a suspect in other terrorist acts.  Washington butts heads
with a fanatical army general (Bruce Willis) who wants martial law
brought about to satisfy his own hunger for power.</P>
<P>'The Siege' has a very interesting message in that for every violent
action there is an equal and swift reaction as people begin
demonstrating as martial law rips apart civil liberties and Arab males
between 14 and 30 are rounded up and then put into concentration
camp-style incarceration.  One thing I admired the film for was the use
of dialogue and situations to explain and avoid any defamation aimed at
Arab-americans.  One scene has a meeting where a group of civil figures
from all points, law enforcement, the media, the army and Arab
anti-defamation leagues explain their desire that not all of them should
be stereotyped for the actions of a few.  Washington's partner in the
FBI (Tony Shalhoub) is shown as a law abiding and law enforcing
Arab-american who loves his country and puts his life on the line
everyday to serve it.</P>
<P>Denzel Washington does it again.  This is his third teaming with
director Edward Zwick after his Oscar-winning turn in 'Glory' and his
impressive leading performance under Zwick in 'Courage Under Fire'.
Washington is one of those actors who can rely on his own voice, look
and personality to get into character each time and still manage to look
different.  Without the benefit of make-up, heavy accent or other
altering factors most of the time, Washington can hold his own with any
of the world's top performers.  He has proven to be both sensitive and
tough on screen and his performance in 'The Siege' is totally different
than his excellent work earlier in the year in Spike Lee's 'He Got
Game'.</P>
<P>Annette Bening is the only wrinkle in the film.  I didn't really buy her
as a CIA agent and Bruce Willis is rather forgettable as the fanatical
general.  But these factors are compensated for by telling a gripping,
plausible and tense story.  Although terrorism has struck the United
States in the past with the Oklahoma City incident and the World Trade
Center bombings, it is reasonable to assume that these incidents while
tragic and unacceptable, have so far been isolated incidents and 'The
Siege' is  filled with the intention of deflecting the possibility of
such a thing ever occurring REGULARLY (terrorism) on American soil and
to be prepared for it if it does.</P>
