<PRE>Copland
Directed by James Mangold</PRE>
<P>Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Harvey Keitel, Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro,
Peter Berg, Janeane Garofalo</P>
<P>Synopsis: A small town sheriff who feels obligated to a popular but
dirty cop must decide whether or not to betray him when a victim of
attempted murder asks for protection.</P>
<P>This is a drama, not an action flick. This time, nstead of playing
Rambo, or Rocky or any other superheroic type of guy,  Sylvester
Stallone plays a sweet, slow-witted, pot-bellied, likeable sheriff of a
small town who wanders sadly an gently through a town that doesnt have
much excitement. The film is called "Cop Land" because the New Jersey
town that Sylvester patrols is mostly inhabited by cops who work across
the bridge in New York. Theres an atmosphere of conpsiracy since
throughout the film, it is made known that the mob has connections with
dirty cops who have connections with dirty politicians, but all of these
clues or not followed up on or explained. I loved the film and thought
it was a great bit of normal-guy type heroism and drama. </P>
<P>Opinion: Whether or not you enjoy the film hinges entirely on one key
point - - it depends on how you interpret Sylvester Stallones
character. If you interpret Stallones character as a smart guy, then
youre going to wonder why he didnt investigate all those
conspiratorial threads and why things are left "hanging" unexplained. If
you interpret him as a slow-witted guy, then youll be happy with this
film, because the film is essentially a morality play, with the moral
that even a gentle, confused guy can make a moral decision to do the
right thing.</P>
