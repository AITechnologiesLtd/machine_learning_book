A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Alfonso Cuarón</PRE>
<P>Written by: Mitch Glazer, from the Charles Dickens classic GREAT
EXPECTATIONS</P>
<P>Starring: 
Ethan Hawke, Gwyneth Paltrow, Hank Azaria, Anne Bancroft, Robert De Niro</P>
<P>Ingredients: 
Starving artist lusting after a beautiful woman from his childhood</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
GREAT EXPECTATIONS (1998) is a modernized version of a Charles Dickens
novel. In the original Charles Dickens classic an orphan boy named Pip
learns about life through his friendship with an escaped convict, his
relationship with a bitter old lady named Miss Havisham, and his
hopeless lifetime infatuation with Havisham's snobbish adopted daughter,
Estella. The gist of the story is that an anonymous benefactor sends Pip
to London for Pip to become an upper class "gentleman." Pip leaves for
London with "great expectations" to be groomed into a gentleman so that
he can one day be classy enough to marry Estella. But life has a way of
complicating things. Pip becomes an arrogant S.O.B. until he learns just
who his secret benefactor is.</P>
<P>In this new 1998 version of GREAT EXPECTATIONS a poor Florida lad named
Finn (Ethan Hawke) with a talent for drawing has an early memory of
helping an escaped convict (Robert De Niro). But soon the focus of
Finn's life becomes romance, as he develops a lifelong infatuation with
Estella (Gwyneth Paltrow), an upper crust girl with some psychological
and emotional issues due to being raised in a dysfunctional environment.
Estella was raised in wealth by Ms. Dinsmoor (Anne Bancroft), an
eccentric, aged and embittered, man-hating single aunt whose groom left
her abandoned at the altar on the day of her marriage. This causes
Estella to 'fear the daylight' of relationships, but Finn thinks it's
just a case of snobbery.</P>
<P>When Finn becomes a young man, an anonymous benefactor sets Finn up in
New York with the connections and publicity to be groomed into a famous
artist. Finn leaves Florida with "great expectations" to be a successful
artist so that some day he might become classy enough to marry the
snobbish Estella. What will happen to all of Finn's "great
expectations?"</P>
<PRE>Opinion:
If you're looking for a romance with a happy ending, look no further;
you've found one here.</PRE>
<P>Ethan Hawke is romantic lead. (He romanced Winona Ryder in REALITY
BITES. He romanced Julie Delpy in BEFORE SUNRISE. He romanced Uma
Thurman in GATTACA. Now in GREAT EXPECTATIONS he gets to chase Gwyneth
Paltrow, a rail-thin blonde.) Hawke plays a lovestruck, earnest and
unchanged Finn throughout the film. </P>
<P>Meanwhile Paltrow portrays Estella as alternating between infuriating
tease and ice princess; Estella's whole purpose is to get men to fall in
love and then hurt them rather than become intimate. Anne Bancroft goes
a little overboard as the deranged and pessimistic Ms. Dinsmoor, while
Robert De Niro carries off the convict part suitably. </P>
<P>The difference between the classic Dickens novel and this 1998
adaptation is that the Dickens novel is ripe with deep and timeless
themes about class struggle and love, whereas GREAT EXPECTATIONS (1998)
is more artsy, less complicated story about a 1990s artist dealing with
a lifetime tease. </P>
