<P>Wistful, cheery and eccentric are three words that come to mind while 
watching director Nigel Cole's "Saving Grace." This is the latest in the 
"eccentric villagers" comedy staple, set forth by "The Full Monty" and 
culminating in the endearing if uneven "Waking Ned Devine." The difference in 
"Saving Grace" is that the villagers are even more wistful, cheery and 
eccentric thanks to a particular type of plant. </P>
<P>Grace (Brenda Blethyn) is one of those villagers, living in the overcast, 
affable fishing village of St. Issacs in Cornwall. Grace is a recent widow 
who gets a lot of emotional support from her fellow neighbors. The problem is 
that she is liable to lose her home and all her possessions, including a 
rented lawnmower, thanks to her husband's financially risky ventures and 
ploys. What can Grace do? She has no money and no job skills, but she is 
fairly adept at maintaining her garden. </P>
<P>This springs an idea in her charming gardener, Matthew (Craig Ferguson, who 
co-wrote the film), who is something of a marijuana specialist. He grows his 
own pot plants at the vicarage, and decides to start a joint business venture 
with Grace by growing several plants in her greenhouse. This leads to the 
film's funniest surprise where the greenhouse is lit with dozens of bright 
lamps each night, leaving an ethereal glow in the sky that keeps the 
villagers entertained in anticipation. One of them mistakenly sees it as a 
sign from God.</P>
<P>Still, since marijuana is illegal, how does one escape notice from the local 
police chief? And what about the agency that is ready to buy out her precious 
house? And what about the shady drug dealers in London who are skeptical of 
Grace's economical enterprise, including the dangerous yet suave Jacques 
(Tcheky Karyo, memorable as the icy agent in "La Femme Nikita")? </P>
<P>"Saving Grace" is mostly a one-joke comedy, and the ending is false and 
unnecessary. Still, there are enough bright moments, a generous dose of 
laughs, and some perfectly-timed one-liners to compensate for what is 
essentially a wittier take on Cheech and Chong. It is also a pleasure to see 
Brenda Blethyn more restrained than usual (considering her over-the-top turn 
in "Little Voice"), and always an undeniable pleasure to see Phyllidia Law 
(Emma Thompson's mother) as a giddy shopkeeper. The characters are all as 
wistful, cheery and eccentric as you can imagine, but they do deliver a smile 
on your face after it is all over. I suspect for most viewers who loved 
"Waking Ned Devine," a smile may be enough. </P>
