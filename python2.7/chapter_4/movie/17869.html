<PRE>As reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>     Look, I know I'm going to get flamed after this, and anyone with a
militant opinion one way or the other about the issue should know that I
really don't care.  So don't waste your time.  That said, down to the review
of one of the most controversial movies I have seen in a while.</P>
<P>     I just got off of a Laura Dern trip.  First, I completed David Lynch's
Wild at Heart.  Then, I immediately popped in Blue Velvet, another
Lynch/Dern collaboration.  Afterwards, I took a brief respite from the
serious in the form of the dark comedy Curdled.  Then, this morning I
checked my TV guide and saw that Citizen Ruth was on TMC so I decided to go
back on my Laura Dern trip.  So, dutifully taking my clicker, I changed to
channel 18 and was greeted by the little dog hyping a feature presentation
and then got down to watching my third Laura Dern movie in two days, Citizen
Ruth.</P>
<P>     Citizen Ruth, like Blue Velvet, is a dark satire.  One of them takes on
a relatively safe subject, small towns, in a relatively unsafe way.  Citizen
Ruth takes on the least safe subject that it can find, abortion, and does it
in the most unsafe way possible.</P>
<P>     Before you start steaming at your computer as your own personal
opinions on the subject come to the surface, let me say this to placate you:
Citizen Ruth does not take a side.  Or, rather, it is equally fair to both.
The fairness that Citizen Ruth displays, however, is in taking each side out
back and beating it with a stick.</P>
<P>     Citizen Ruth follows Ruth Stoops (Laura Dern), a huffer by inclination
that has been charged with criminally endangering her fetus.  Now, here
starts the offensive part: the judge has made an offer to reduce the charges
if she decides to get an abortion.  While in jail awaiting trial, a group of
rabid pro-lifers called the "baby savers" (with the centerpiece players
being Kurtwood Smith, Mary Kay Place, and Burt Reynolds) bail her out and
decide to make sure that she has the baby (mainly motivated not even out of
a concern for the baby but because they want to take the judge and hang him
out to dry.)</P>
<P>    These people are the stereotypes.  They are Republicans, owning a
mortgaged house and having two kids (one a rebellious slut (Alicia Witt)
underneath their nose).  The husband works, the wife does not.  The son
makes model planes.  The husband has a wandering eye.  They sing praises to
Christ until the cows come home.</P>
<P>     Ruth, of course, is the complete antithesis of them.  She wants to
watch a TV which they don't have.  She wants to party, which is, of course,
a sin.  And, in order to avoid going to jail, she wants to have an abortion.
So they send her to an anti-abortion clinic where caring is supposed to be
the doctrine but it ends up being more like complete hatred.</P>
<P>     When you're starting to really get the point about how hypocritical the
anti-abortion people are being, you then get to see the pro-choicers
skewered like a shiskabob.  Ruth ends up being kicked out of the pro-lifer's
home and into the hands of a self-proclaimed "spy in the war", Diane
(Swoosie Kurtz).  Diane, Democrat to the bone, has been playing as if she
hates abortion so she could go undercover and get inside information to
sabotage the baby savers plans.  Can you say "psycho?"</P>
<P>     Diane is a lesbian, pagan, new-age fanatic who wants nothing more than
to make sure that Ruth gets the abortion.  She calls in Harlan (M.C.
Gainey), ex-special forces commando that makes absolutely sure the
pro-lifers don't disturb their well-laid plans.</P>
<PRE>     Wait, it gets worse.</PRE>
<P>     As the debate increases much like a cold war, money is laid down on the
table.  The pro-lifers start by offering $15,000.  The pro-choicers
counterbid.  Ruth, feeling like she has won the lottery, is ecstatic.</P>
<P>     Now most of you with strong opinions are probably going for your
shotguns trying to find where I and the people who made this film lived.
Please, leave us alone.  As I said, Citizen Ruth never really speculates on
whether abortion is right or wrong… it only states that when you take an
opinion too strongly, things go wrong.</P>
<P>     Look at it!  You have a group of people saying that they want to save
the baby that don't care anything about the baby!  In the other corner, you
have a group saying that they want to save the woman that doesn't care
anything about the woman!  The message Citizen Ruth displays is for all of
the disillusioned souls who have gotten caught up so much in the war over
right and wrong that they have forgotten right and wrong in and of
themselves.</P>
<P>     The movie ends up being laughable thanks to the excellent performance
by Dern, who shines through as always and doesn't make the mistake of trying
to make Ruth nice.  Were Ruth a nice person, the story would lose its point,
and no one would want that.</P>
<P>     The film is bitterly ironic to the end, as shown in the fact that both
sides, professing endlessly to care about Ruth, are too busy shouting each
other down to notice that she's gone.  Oh, well.</P>
<P>     For anyone with or without a militant opinion, this movie should show
you why you should not possess it.  It is a movie with a political motive, a
satiric means, and a wonderful end.  I'd say enjoy, but it's not quite the
right word.</P>
