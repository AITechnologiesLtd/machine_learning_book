<PRE>WHEN BRENDAN MET TRUDY
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2001 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>After "The Commitments," "The Snapper," and "The Van," Roddy Doyle's "When
Brendan Met Trudy" is a real disappointment from the Irish novelist and
screenwriter.  Compared to those smart, snappy screenplays, Doyle's latest
is a minor work indeed.  It tries too hard to be quirky.  It tries too hard
to be hip.  And all too often it winds up committing the greatest crime of
all: it's boring.</P>
<P>With its fanciful tale of a mild-mannered (read: feeble) schoolteacher
(Peter McDonald) who forms an unlikely relationship with a free-spirited
(read: rude) petty thief (Flora Montgomery), the film has its moments but
labors under Doyle's insistence on cramming his screenplay chock full of
cinematic references.  Brendan (McDonald), who moonlights as a choirboy, is
also an avid movie buff so these film references come thick and fast.</P>
<P>There are nods towards Godard, John Wayne, Polish films (especially the
one made in color!), "Sunset Boulevard," film noir, Leone's spaghetti
westerns, "Rocco and His Brothers"--even the film's title is a rather
obvious play on "When Harry Met Sally..."</P>
<P>By the time this longer-than-it-need-be film is over, all this forced and
frantic cleverness feels rather obvious too.</P>
<P>McDonald, who played opposite Brendan Gleeson in the splendid Irish
gangster flick "I Went Down," is required to sleepwalk his way through his
milquetoast role.  Montgomery (as the carefree, abrasive Trudy) is
accommodating, but her character is a strangely unappealing one.  The end
result is a character-driven story with two lackluster leads: not your best
of combinations by a long chalk.</P>
<P>Brendan and Trudy meet in a pub (where else; this is Dublin!) where Trudy
is taken by Brendan's singing ability.  Brendan is attracted to Trudy's
insouciance (which justifies her standing him up on their first date,
naturally).  They meet; they get the hots for one another; they take it
from there.  But where do they take it, exactly?  Not very far.  The sex
scenes are good though (in a natural, awkward, non-Hollywood way).</P>
<P>Reportedly Doyle specifically asked Kieron Walsh to direct the project
(the two had worked together in television but Walsh had never directed a
feature film before).  Walsh's rookie handling of the material might be
somewhat responsible for the film's lack of charm, but when you come right
down to it Doyle has done much, much better.</P>
<P>Let's hope McDonald and Montgomery are given a better vehicle than "When
Brenda Met Trudy" next time out.</P>
