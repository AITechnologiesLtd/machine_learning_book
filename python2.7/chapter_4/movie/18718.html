<PRE>FREE ENTERPRISE</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  ** out of ****</PRE>
<P>There are guys out there who grew up on Star Trek, and perhaps even
lived it out in various ways.  In their younger days, they fantasized
about being Captain Kirk, maybe role played the part on the school
playground or had a costume with the familiar yellow shirt and black
pants.  These folks have gotten older, and although they no longer
dress the part on Halloween, the attraction to the 30+ year old
phenomenon is still very much there, and still an influence.  FREE
ENTERPRISE is about two such young men in their late twenties, Robert
(Rafer Weigel) and Mark (Eric McCormack), childhood friends who find
themselves at a crossroads of sorts as they approach the big three-oh.
Taking stock of their lives so far, they together attempt to sort out
their lives in work, love, and Star Trek.</P>
<P>To me, Star Trek is a great source of entertainment.  I don't revere
it as the end-all of morality, like some people do, but rather view it
as a nice outlook for our own future.  I also believe that in order to
truly enjoy Star Trek, one must be able to laugh at it, and there are
so many reasons and ways to do so.  A film like FREE ENTERPRISE is
something for which a lot of people (including myself) have been
waiting a long time.  There is no doubt that this film was made for
Star Trek fans because of the many references to the episodes and
movies (oh, and that's Classic Trek, folks - sorry Next Generation
fans).  Many of the best laughs will probably be lost on
non-aficionados.  It's revealed, for example, that one of Mark's
fantasies is to get in bed with a green woman.  One might not really
catch the meaning of this unless you knew that the Talosians attempted
to seduce the previous captain of the Starship Enterprise, Capt.
Christopher Pike, with a sexy green Orion woman in the only two-part
Star Trek Episode entitled "The Menagerie", in a scene which was
really from the original pilot episode entitled "The Cage", before
series creator Gene Roddenberry revamped the show and replaced all of
the actors except for Leonard Nimoy.  Or, um, at least that's what
I've been told.</P>
<P>However, in a possible attempt to make the film more accessible to the
rest of the world, screenwriters Mark Altman and Robert Meyer Burnett
(it's no coincidence that the main characters have the same names)
have chosen to dilute this main comedic drive with a number of more
mainstream jokes, leaving the Star Trek punch not as potent as it
should be.  Unfortunate, especially since the mainstream humor doesn't
really click.  The result is fewer belly laughs for the fans, and
lukewarm jokes for everyone else.  If I had my druthers, there'd be a
Star Trek joke every few minutes.  After all, why take on such a
monolithic source of potential humor as the main drive for your film
if you're not going to exploit it?</P>
<P>Speaking of exploitation, William Shatner, who plays himself, gets the
Good Sport of the Year Award just for being in this film.  One of the
first scenes includes Robert and Mark browsing in a book store when
they see the man who portrayed Captain James T. Kirk himself - and
he's flipping through a porno mag.  After he gets to know them, he
attempts to enlist their help in producing a new version of
Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, in which he'll play all the roles.
Forget about what everyone else has said about Shatner's ego.  You've
got to love a man who can allow himself to be made fun of like that.</P>
<P>One of the interesting things about this film is that the characters
do things which my friends and I - er, I mean, which I've seen other
people do....from time to time.  For example, Robert, Mark and their
friends are going out to a special screening of STAR TREK II:  THE
WRATH OF KAHN.  How do they show their enthusiasm?  By all shouting,
"Khaaaaan!", ala Kirk when marooned in the tunnels of the Regula Moon,
second stage experiment for the Genesis Project - or, um, so I'm told.
The thing is, the characters are too much like regular people, who, in
addition to showing their enthusiasm for Star Trek now and then, also
have other interests, and showcasing these other interests strays our
attention even further from the main feature.  There's a big deal
about going to the comics store, having a collection of Star Wars
action figures, and possessing the Criterion Collection laserdisc
versions of Hitchcock films.  Realistic?  Yes.  Good for the film?
No.</P>
<P>There are a couple of half-hearted attempts at throwing in a romance
angle.  Robert falls in love with a woman, but really doesn't know how
to handle the emotions.  Meanwhile, Shatner falls in love with the
proprietor of a trendy night club/bar, and spends some of his time
trying to get her attention.  There's great potential here to explore
how Star Trek affects the way each of these men deal with love, or how
love affects their association with Star Trek.  Unfortunately, the
romance angle has no clear association with the topic, and is
furthermore less than compelling.</P>
<P>Am I going too far in criticizing the film for detracting from the
Star Trek jokes?  Am I missing the point that the film is really about
how average people relate to themselves and to each other?  I don't
think so.  I mean, the film is called FREE ENTERPRISE, after all, and
it does have William Shatner.  Star Trek not only has to be the main
theme, but the overriding theme, and this film simply does not deliver
in this respect.  It's too bad because this FREE ENTERPRISE could have
filled a niche empty up until now, a true Star Trek fan parody.  It
really could have gone where no one had gone before.  Come on, now.
You know I had to say it.</P>
