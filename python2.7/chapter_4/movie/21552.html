<P>  During the greedy 1980s the word "mentor" became the
most fashionable term in the American lexicon.  Mentors are
people who "adopt" young, rising workers, show them the
ropes, and ease their way into the fast track of steady
promotions.  "The Bone Collector" is about such a person,
unusual in that he is frightfully handicapped, but there is no
greed or economic motivation involved in his relationship with
the younger member.  This is a buddy movie, a police drama,
a revenge fantasy and even a romance between two folks
who--in the typical Hollywood formula--have bones to pick
with each other in the early part but collect nothing but good
will as their affiliation deepens.  A watchable movie despite
its lack of originality, "The Bone Collector" takes off from the
classic "Seven," David Fincher's portrait of a serial killer who
wallows in the depths of human depravity, deliberately leaving
clues around his murders to taunt the police.  While Phillip
Noyce, its director, exploits the appeal of one of Hollywood's
handsomest, Denzel Washington, the picture often look like a
showcase for the seductive Angelina Jolie--who has yet to
prove that she can act--though New York Times critic
Stephen Holden cites her "sensuous lips and eyes that burn
with a soft, melting fire" and calls her the most alluring of the
young Hollywood stars.</P>
<P>   The Martin Bregman production taken from Jeffrey
Deaver's novel and a screenplay by Jeremy Iacone has been
cited by some as a picture for strong stomachs only and for
masochists.  Even Roger Ebert downgraded the production
for what he considers the excessive gore.  While not
exceptionally violent, some scenes do present a challenge for
the sensitive eyes.  We see in mid-range the face of a New
York University student who had been bloodied and left tied
up in a subterranean hell for the rats to devour.  We see as
well the corpse of a middle-aged woman, similarly handcuffed
to a pipe, who has been executed by a long burst of steam. 
In one instance, an older man is found drowned at the pier
but his young granddaughter is rescued, which seems to
prove that commercial movies can dispense with the old but
are fearful of letting the audience believe a vulnerable little
girl with a life ahead of her should be left for dead.</P>
<P>   The story opens on a policewoman assigned to counsel
youths, Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie), who happens upon
a man whose hand is showing through the gravel in which he
is buried, a finger amputated with his wife's wedding band on
the stub.  This signals us that the killer is mocking the police
by deliberately leaving a clue and that we are bound to find
similar victims of a serial killer.  The most frightening images,
however, are not of the bloodied, beaten and ravaged victims
of this sick personality but the sight of various passengers
getting into the killer's taxicab only to be locked in, blocked
by impenetrable glass from exiting the vehicle.</P>
<P>   Much of the drama takes place in the spacious apartment
of Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington), a forensic expert with
the police department who, four years previous, was
paralyzed by a falling beam.  He now has a intricate array of
machinery to direct forensics and a full-time nurse, Thelma
(Queen Latifah), to care for him and administer oxygen when
he undergoes seizures.  Since Rhyme has no feeling except
in one finger, he is suicidal, particularly fearing the one big
seizure that will leave him a vegetable.  Though he has made
arrangements with a friendly doctor for a "final transition," the
case involving this serial killer awakens his interest in life.  He
is particularly fond of Officer Donaghy, and pushes her
against her will into pursuing the case.</P>
<P>   The plot is loaded with absurdities, but that's the name of
the game with commercial murder mysteries.  The audience,
like Officer Rhyme, tries to figure out who the killer is, but
unfortunately--in the picture's major flaw--the perp is no one
you could possibly expect.  He is like "a temp, in for the day,"
as Roger Ebert says, a psychotic individual bent on revenge
whose clues would not likely be of use to any with less
prescience than the two New York cops who decipher them--
with the aid of wild coincidences such as one that occurs in a
store stocking old, turn-of-the-century books.</P>
<P>   New York looks great.  The skyscrapers framed at night
are majestic, enough to bring in any tourists who might
otherwise have been scared away by yet another picture
about that (formerly) high-crime city.  The studio shots, which
serve as the subterranean hells of sewer systems and an
unused subway station, are something out of Dante.  We can
even overlook the outrageous coincidences and out-of-the-
blue killer as typical contrivances of commercial murder
mysteries, because "The Bone Collector" is gripping and Ms.
Jolie, for all her tentativeness in the acting department, is
pleasant on the eyes.</P>
