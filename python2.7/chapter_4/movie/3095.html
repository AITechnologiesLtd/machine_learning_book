<PRE>                           MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Richard Attenborough, Elizabeth Perkins, Dylan McDermott,
           Mara Wilson.
Screenplay:  John Hughes and George Seaton.
Director:  Les Mayfield.</P>
<P>     Let's leave aside for a moment the question of whether it was
really *necessary* to make an updated version of the 1947 classic
MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET.  It's the question that plagues every remake,
often unfairly.  While it may be rare to find a film done *better* the
second time around, that doesn't necessarily mean that the remake might
not be perfectly enjoyable on its own merits.  And I believe that this
is true in the case of this gentle fantasy.  While it is nothing
spectacular, it's genuinely touching, and feeds off a surprisingly
strong current of spirituality.</P>
<P>     MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET opens in New York on Thanksgiving day,
where the Cole's Department Store Thanksgiving Parade is about to kick
off the Christmas shopping season.  When the parade's Santa makes a
drunken spectacle of himself, parade organizer Dorey Walker (Elizabeth
Perkins) plucks a replacement right off the street.  He is Kriss
Kringle (Richard Attenborough), and he becomes a sensation as a
department store Santa filled with the holiday spirit.  He even begins
to make a believer out of Dorey's cynical-before-her-time daughter
Susan (Mara Wilson).  But Kriss Kringle's success means trouble for a
rival discount store, whose owner (Energizer Bunny nemesis Joss
Ackland) orchestrates a scandal which will force the people of New York
to decide whether or not they believe in Santa Claus.</P>
<P>     John (HOME ALONE) Huges was the producer and co-scripter of this
film, and it may work primarily because it operates against everything
you might most fear from a Hughes project.  With the exception of some
pratfall shenanigans at the parade early in the film, Huges and
director Les Mayfield avoid excess, keeping the story low-key and
character based.  The characters are not uniformly interesting, mind
you.  The love story between perkins and a too-good-to-be-true
attorney (Dylan McDermott) is not well-developed, largely because
Perkins doesn't do too much with her role to show why such a perfect
guy is interested in such a depressing woman.  The villains are also
pretty boring, and Jane Leeves (Daphne from TV's "Frasier") in
particular has nothing to do and even less to say as one of the rival
store's operatives.</P>
<P>     However, it is the casting of actor/director Richard Attenborough
as Kriss Kringle which helps the MIRACLE happen.  Sure, he's no Edmund
Gwenn, who won an Academy Award for his portrayal in the original, but
Attenborough is a warm and lively presence who is perfectly believable
as an embodiment of human kindness without being *too* saintly.  A
scene in which he "speaks" to a deaf girl in sign language really put a
lump in my throat, and there is a lot of genuine emotion in the film.
Also impressive is Mara Wilson, the youngest daughter from MRS.
DOUBTFIRE, who avoids overly-precocious traps while handling some
tricky dialogue for a young actress.  She too pulls off a touching
scene in which the young Susan, torn over whether or not to believe in
Santa Claus, asks her mother whether she could believe if she wanted
to, without disapproval.</P>
<P>     That conversation is part of a challenging theme in MIRACLE ON
34TH STREET, and it brings us back to the question we started with:
why remake this movie?  The answer can be found in the ways (and
occasionally none-too-subtle ones, it should be fairly noted) that
Huges and Mayfield use belief in Santa Claus as a metaphor for
contemporary views on religious faith.  The film asks whether the world
is a better place for the erosion of faith, not because of some effect
on "values," but because of an effect on the human spirit; it asks
whether it is really a good thing to raise a child without faith.  Many
viewers might not appreciate being confronted with these questions, but
so few films ever dare to deal with the subject of faith that MIRACLE
ON 34TH STREET should be commended for trying.  If it's not entirely
successful, it's partly because Robert Prosky, as the judge presiding
over the Kriss Kringle case, fumbles the speech which should emphasize
this theme by making it far too animated when it should be pitched
lower.  The film's denouement is also somewhat too long, and doesn't
maintain the spirit of the scenes with Attenborough.  But the important
thing is that MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET is a good family entertainment
that takes a chance on being about something.  And it made a believer
out of me.</P>
