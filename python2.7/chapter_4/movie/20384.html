<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Excellent. Go see it. "The Sixth Sense" bills itself as a psychological
thriller, but it's really more of a supernatural adventure picture that will
"raise those prickly hairs on the back of your neck."</P>
<P>Bruce Willis plays a child psychologist trying to "heal" a paranoid boy
(Osment). The boy's affliction: he's always scared. And he has good reason
to be.</P>
<P>Though this synopsis is quite brief, more said would mean fewer surprises.
And this is one film sure to surprise you. Rather, let's turn our attention
to the "horror" factor. Make no mistake, this is not a mindless slasher
film. And though it has its moments of gore -- they're usually brief.
Instead, it's the relationship between the psychologist and the boy that
aptly carries the picture -- that and the subjects of the child's "sixth
sense."</P>
<P>Bruce, the boy and his screen mother perform flawlessly. Writer M. Night
Shyamalan has given us characters for whom we care deeply and then wrapped
them up in the most dire of circumstance. But that's not all, he's directed
this picture with meticulous care.</P>
<P>It's a film that will resonate within you.</P>
<P>Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, Tony Collette and Olivia Williams.
Written and Directed by M. Night Shyamalan.
Produced by Frank Marshall, Kathleen Kennedy and Barry Mendel at
Hollywood/Spyglass.
Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Grade..........................A+</P>
