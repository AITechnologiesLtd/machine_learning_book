<PRE>PAULINA
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>     When a film is produced on a shoestring budget by a couple of
hardworking filmmakers and when it tells the story of a genuine
tragedy, the easy path for a reviewer who hated the movie is to give it
a pass.  Toss out your usual objectivity, ignore how many times you
checked your watch while viewing it, forget how unbearable it was to
sit through, and find some meaningless way to compliment it.  This, of
course, will be of no service to your readers, but at least you'll
avoid the hate mail from the movie's fans.</P>
<P>     Thus it is with a heavy heart that I review the movie PAULINA (not
to be confused with the recent movie PAULIE about a talking parrot).
Directed by Vicky Funari as a labor of intense love - she spent the
last one third of her life on film - the movie blends documentary
footage with historic and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly
sad and true story of Paulina Cruz Suarez.  Paulina was a maid in
Vicky's household when Vicky was young.</P>
<P>     I got to learn the film's background when I attended a screening
in which the two women who made it were present.  For those without
such context, the reaction to the film may be that it is a parody of a
bad indie film.  The acting is amateurish, the story is maudlin, and it
has all the visual appeal of a bad home movie.  Grainy and overexposed,
the movie, shot on 16mm film and videotape, has little to recommend it.
Confusingly composed, the movie jumps about jarringly as it tells its
story.</P>
<P>     Quite bloody at times, the story, full of horrific images, seems
designed to shock and repulse us.  Why else would you include a scene
with a completely nude and bloody 8-year-old Paulina?</P>
<P>     Another scene has a teenage Paulina being fondled on a bus by the
man sitting next to her.  In retaliation, she bites off part of his
finger.  This covers the both of them in a bucket of blood.  The
passengers on the bus then view the girl in their minds as everything
from saint to sinner.  One, for example, sees her as an Aztec priestess
holding out a large heart that she had just cut from a body.</P>
<P>     The lugubrious tale has Paulina being raped and beaten.  Certainly
she had to endure a miserable life.  But that does not guarantee that a
movie about her will necessarily being good.  I felt trapped in the
theater watching it.  Only the opportunity to talk with the filmmakers
afterwards made the movie bearable.</P>
<P>     PAULINA runs 1:28.  The film is in Spanish with English subtitles.
It is not rated but would be an R for violence and nudity and would be
acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
