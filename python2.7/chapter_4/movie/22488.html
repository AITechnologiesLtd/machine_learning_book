<PRE>_Titus_ (R) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        If you thought Baz Luhrmann's radical take on
_William_Shakespeare's_Romeo_+_Juliet_ was wild, wait until what you
see what Tony Award-winning stage director Julie Taymor
(_The_Lion_King:_The_Broadway_Musical_) does to the Bard's
_Titus_Andronicus_ for her audacious--and very bloody--film debut.
While Luhrmann transplanted the star-crossed lovers to 1990s Florida,
Taymor keeps this grisly tale of revenge in Rome--but places it in a
surreal temporal limbo.  The Colosseum suggests the proper time of
Imperial Rome, but high rises and heavy duty kitchen ovens suggest the
1990s, while the vintage automobiles and some costumes are more '40s
and '50s, and other garments are more gladiator-like.  As Tamora,
Queen of Goths (Jessica Lange) exacts revenge on Roman general Titus
(Anthony Hopkins) for killing her eldest son, and he does the same to
her for the wrongs she commits, Taymor obviously wanted to express the
timeless relevance of the story's underlying themes.  However, the
time convergence approach only works at times, for often it's just
distracting, as in one scene where Tamora's suviving sons (Matthew
Rhys and Jonathan Rhys Meyers) blow off steam playing video arcade
games.</P>
<P>        Taymor didn't have to resort to such avant garde time tricks,
for the story would have resonated just as strongly had she jettisoned
them.  She is a strong storyteller and a master visual stylist, the
latter compliment encompassing all areas, makeup and costume choices
as well as those in the editing and photography departments.  She also
has a sure way with actors; Hopkins' Titus is at once tragic and
horrifying, and Lange is sultry as the viperous Tamora.  The clear
standout of the cast, however, is Harry Lennix as Aaron, a Moor who is
Tamora's secret lover and a schemer in his own right.  Lennix brings
great depth to a role that could have easily been played as a stock
villain.  A great villain he indeed is, but to leave it at that isn't
giving full justice to his powerful and multi-dimensional work.
_Titus_ isn't a complete success, but it is never less than
fascinating, and it announces the arrival of a fearlessly imaginative
new cinematic voice.</P>
