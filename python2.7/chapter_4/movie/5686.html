<PRE>                             WALKING AND TALKING
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Well, a lot more talking than walking....  And not to be confused with
last year's KICKING AND SCREAMING.</P>
<P>     And not at all a bad movie, and the most aptly titled film out right
now.  WALKING AND TALKING is basically just that, focusing on best friends
Laura (Anne Heche) and Amelia (Catherine Keener) and their comedic
struggles with life and love at the dawn of the big 3-0.</P>
<P>     Laura is about to marry Frank (Todd Field) and is having the jitters.
Amelia is a confirmed, miserable bachelorette, and she dallies with the
local video store clerk (Kevin Corrigan), aka "The Ugly Guy," and
ex-boyfriend Andrew (Liev Schreiber).</P>
<P>     And essentially, they all just talk.  A lot.  And it's pretty funny,
with topics of conversation running the gamut from cat vomit to therapy to
schlock horror flicks.  The characters themselves have also been taken to
the hilt.  Frank isn't just a jewelry designer -- he designs only the
really tacky stuff you'd see in a Montgomery Wards catalog.  Schreiber, the
funniest of the lot, reprises his phone sex-obsessed character from DENISE
CALLS UP, and has an addiction to porn videos.  Then there's headliners
Amelia and Laura, whose collective litany of neuroses makes me look like a
sane person.</P>
<P>     So yes, it's funny, but at some point I kept wondering, do people
really talk like this?  The conversations tend to get a bit extreme and
explicit -- running into candid sexual discussions and descriptions of
bodily functions that would put off Madonna.  Humorous?  Sure.  Realistic?
I don't think so.</P>
<P>     That's unfortunate, because this reliance on over-the-top dialogue is
the only thing that really detracts from the picture, which is otherwise a
frank and funny depiction of urban life in the 90's.  (And I was a little
disappointed by the lack of a real ending, too.)</P>
<P>     So no ending on this review, either, but you get a parting fun fact:
watch for people's kitchens -- everyone has the same toaster oven.</P>
