<P>Susan Granger's review of "A MAP OF THE WORLD" (First Look Pictures)</P>
<P> There's no greater tragedy than being responsible for the
death of a child, and that's just the first blow Sigourney Weaver
suffers at the beginning of this complex, dramatic portrait of a woman
in emotional agony. Then, still reeling with guilt, she's falsely
accused of child abuse, an offense which sends her to jail to await
trial. Based on the novel by Jane Hamilton and adapted by Peter Hedges
and Polly Platt, it's an implausible yet harrowing story of
victimization. Weaver plays Alice Goodwin, a devoted mother of two
daughters who works part-time as a school nurse in a rural Wisconsin
town. She and her wimpy, taciturn husband (David Strathairn), a
farmer, are a curiosity. They're relative newcomers who painted their
barn blue. But, above all, the bright, fiercely independent Alice
arouses people's ire with her cynical, sarcastic attitude towards the
complexities of life. Her only friend is a gentle neighbor (Julianne
Moore) who also has two little girls. Her nemesis is a tarty welfare
mom (Chloe Sevigny) whom outspoken Alice openly accuses of neglecting
her young son. When suspicion focuses on Alice after an accidental
drowning in a pond on her property, the town turns on her with
self-righteous fury, preferring to believe the flimsy, bogus charges
of child molestation brought against her rather than seek the
truth. Oddly, the unflappable Alice seems to relish her martyrdom,
openly enjoying her predicament. Whether it's because that's her
perverse way of coping with the bizarre situation or she's temporarily
insane is not made clear by director Scott Elliot, who makes it into a
masochistic, maudlin melodrama.  On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to
10, A Map of the World is a dense, disturbing, depressing 4, made
tolerable only by Sigourney Weaver's intelligent, vivid performance.</P>
