<P>Let me make this point first – Godzilla isn't even as good as the
inferior South Park episode starring Barbra Streisand as the lizard
king.  It's a horrendously long, poorly acted, unoriginal piece of crap
that made me sad to be a Japanese-American.</P>
<P>Brought to you by the creative team responsible for the reprehensible
but slightly more entertaining Independence Day, Godzilla breaks
virtually no new ground in terms of mayhem, destruction or disaster.
You've seen it all before – giant reptile running through a major city
(The Lost World: Jurassic Park), doing the breaststroke (Alien
Resurrection) and multiplying like a bunny (Gremlins).  Mix it up with
some of the most obvious product placement scenes ever and you've got
yourself one hell of a condemnable snoozer.</P>
<P>Can I mention the glaring omission of people being chomped up by the
great beast?  Why bother giving him sharp pointy teeth if he ain't gonna
use humans for chew toys?  They've made Godzilla into such a PC/PG panty
waste, that if he ever did show up on Manhattan, the kids would want to
hug it instead of running away in terror.  Barney is actually a more
offensive creature, albeit on a completely different level.</P>
<P>Yeah, the beginning is all right and the ending is OK, but what the hell
happened to the 90 minutes in the middle?  I guess the filmmakers felt
that they needed an opportunity to showcase the fantastic story and
Oscar caliber acting.  It's certainly understandable, since most people
are paid to see Maria Pitillo and not the actual monster.</P>
<P>Maybe I was expecting too much originality.  I mean if I made this film,
I would have had Godzilla dry humping buildings, taking a huge dump into
Yankee Stadium, using Patrick Ewing as a toothpick and cramming subway
cars up its ass.  But that's just me.  I like things dark.</P>
<P>And as if that wasn't enough recycling, just wait until the closing
credits where Puff Daddy shuffles all over Led Zeppelin's `Kashmir'.  A
perfect ending to a perfectly boring film.</P>
