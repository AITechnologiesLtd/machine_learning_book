<PRE>BY AARON THE MOVIE CRITIC</PRE>
<P>October Sky is a great movie. It's family friendly, grandparent
friendly, and it's a film you can recommend to almost any aged
person. It funny, touching, and a great made film.</P>
<P>October Sky is the true story of Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is
interested in rocketry after watching the Russian spacecraft Sputnik
fly through the "October Sky" over his small town in West Virginia. He
starts making plans which his friends Roy Lee (William Lee Scott) and
O'Dell (Chad Lindberg) to make a small rocket that will, hopefully,
fly.  They find they need more help with the technical elements of the
rocket building so they ask for help from the neighborhood smart kid
Quentin (Chris Owen). Together the four start a journey that will
hopefully get them out of the small mining town they live in.</P>
<P>Homer's father John (Chris Cooper) is the town's best miner and
expects his son to continue his tradition. So Homer has many scenes
that are tense with his father. Homer's teacher Ms. Riley (Laura Dern)
encourages him to make a great rocket and to get out the town on a
scholarship.  Both are storylines that play along with the boy's
journey.</P>
<P>Director Joe Johnston who has made great films before, like Field of
Dreams, puts a great feeling into this film. He doesn't overuse or
underuse a character through the whole film. Homer is the main
character but he doesn't steal screentime from any of his friends or
family. I have a feeling this project meant a lot to Johnston because
this type of film would probably be through into made for TV territory
without the great screenplay by Lewis Colick and Johnston's big
status.</P>
<P>Many will complain that this is film is full of cliches and plays with
the storyline like a well produced made for TV movie. I thought of
October Sky cliches as if they weren't there then it wouldn't be quite
as enjoyable. If Homer and friends failed and ended up wasting the
rest of their lives in the mine breathing in the black smoke then it
wouldn't a good movie would it? Also this is based on a true story so
we know this is humanly possible for these teen's to pull off what
they did.</P>
<P>My only complaint with this film is that it came out way too early in
the year. Come the 2000 Academy Awards (it feels very weird saying
that) it will be forgotten by many the nominators. This film should be
nominated a couple of times. The cinematogery is beautiful taking full
advantage of the surroundings of the small town. The acting is top
notch and I'd love to see Gyllenhaal, Cooper, and Dern get the
nomiantions they deserve.</P>
<P>How about that Gylenhaal. A unknown to me has shown a type of charm
and great acting I haven't seen since River Phoenix. Pray he doesn't
end up making teen horror films in the future. I can't wait to see his
next film though.</P>
<P>October Sky is a film that will inspire kids and teens to make
something great out of their lives. I'm not saying they will go out
and build rockets but I am saying that this is a film they will
remember when time to choose a job comes around.</P>
