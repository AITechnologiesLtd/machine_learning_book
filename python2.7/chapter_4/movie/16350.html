<PRE>Review: A Thin Red Line
Rated `R'
A Review by: Ryan Davis</PRE>
<P>        It was hard to watch a World War II film without comparing it to
Spielburg's epic `Saving Private Ryan.' Since both films were released in
1998 and both dealt with the horror of war, comparison is unavoidable. While
`A Thin Red Line' is a solid film that has some strong features, it doesn't
touch the audience like SPR did.</P>
<P>        The plot is very loosely strung together; it's like the camera just
follows around a group of soldiers. Sgt. Edward Welsh (Sean Penn) is a tough
as nails career soldier; war is his life. Capt. James 'Bugger' Staros (Elias
Koteas) is a captain who refuses to risk the lives of his troops,
unnecessarily. Lt. Col. Gordon Tall (Nick Nolte) is a officer, who has been
passed over so many times for general that he sees the war as his last chance
at earning his stars. The list could go on and on, but most of the characters
are in and out of the picture so fast you won't even get attached to any of
them. There are also tons of cameos from stars, like John Travolta to George
Clooney.</P>
<P>        That is the main problem with `A Thin Red Line', lack of character
development. There are just too many characters. Since we don't know anyone
well enough to care about them, we don't care what happens to them in the end.
There are other weaknesses as well, including running time and narration. `A
Thin Red Line' is way too long, or maybe it's just the fact that it runs
forever without any development. Then there are the endless voiceovers by at
least four different characters. This becomes tiresome, really quickly.</P>
<P>        Not just to focus just on flaws, `A Thin Red Line' is still an above
average film. It's chock-full of great performances, with the leading standout
being Nick Nolte's Oscar worthy performance.  Also the cinematography is just
beautiful and the battle scenes are outstanding.</P>
<P>        While `A Thin Red Line' isn't the masterpiece that `Saving Private
Ryan' was, it is still a worthwhile film. If you have a good amount of time
and you don't mind spending it in the theater, check it out.</P>
