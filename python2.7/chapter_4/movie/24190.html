<P>     Hey, did you hear about the film that took on the subject of our
collective fascination with gossip and innuendo? It takes a serious look
about how any story, told enough times, takes on the ring of truth, even
if we have no concrete sense of where the story came from. It challenges
us to be more skeptical of the tabloid-ization of our culture, our
readiness to pass judgment on situations about which we know little and
our obsession with the lurid over the substantive. It uses nuanced
performances and taut plotting to give us a chilling glimpse into the way
we contribute to warped perceptions and damaged lives every time we pay
attention to the rumor mill.</P>
<P>     Well, that's the story Warner Bros. would like to see disseminated,
anyway. And like most buzz, there's a germ of truth to it surrounded by a
whole lot of nonsense. GOSSIP is actually a tawdry youth soap opera full
of attractive people doing awful things -- CRUEL INTENTIONS gone to
college. The story focuses on a trio of college roommates -- trust fund
brat Derrick (James Marsden), introverted aspiring artist Travis (Norman
Reedus) and nondescript obligatory female Jones (Lena Headey) -- who are
also taking a communication class together. As a class project, the three
decide to spread a patently false rumor about a classmate to track its
progress. Their target is Naomi (Kate Hudson), spotted at a party
wandering drunkenly upstairs with boyfriend Beau (Joshua Jackson). When
Jones begins gossip that the two had sex at the party, the tale soon grows
out of control. And suddenly Naomi believes the rumor herself, and is
pressing charges against Beau for date rape.</P>
<P>     Ah, what a deliciously scandalous and utterly exploitative premise.
Beneath the meticulously glossy production design and lifestyles-of-the-
rich-and-beautiful voyeurism is a bubbling underground river of hypocrisy.
It's bad enough that GOSSIP feigns ambiguity just long enough to set up
obvious hedonistic villainy. It's even worse that the entire atmosphere of
the film proves the filmmakers don't take any of its serious issues
seriously. It might be interesting to explore the destructive power of
rumor in a setting where you felt there was something at stake. GOSSIP, on
the other hand, is instantly disposable foolishness more interested in
being sexy than being substantive. A film like this trying to make a case
against people succumbing to their basest fascination with sordid stories
-- it almost makes you want to laugh in the faces of those responsible.</P>
<P>     But there are so many more reasons to laugh at GOSSIP besides its
philosophical ineptitude. There's good old-fashioned story-telling
ineptitude, like a police detective refusing to follow up a lead because
of a story someone told her, or a college student wandering into the
library of an exclusive prep school to do some research. There's poor Lena
Headey's ineptitude at affecting a New England accent to mask her Old
England accent. Then there are the more sublime bits of silliness, like
the obligatory torrential downpour for the finale, or the stunning lack of
characterization offered to anyone in the film. And the less said about
the dialogue, the better.</P>
<P>     Some critics of GOSSIP will probably fixate on its final, convoluted
plot twist as the film's most ridiculous element, but I'd be inclined to
disagree. Buying the ending simply involves believing that one of the
film's characters is not just too stupid to be in college, but too stupid
to be allowed to live. Considering the rest of the stupidity involved in
GOSSIP, that's not a tremendous stretch. I'd like to think that an
intelligent film could have been made about the scorched earth effects of 
our indiscriminate telling of tales. GOSSIP, a film targeted at teenagers,
had a chance to be that film.</P>
<PRE>     And if you believe that one, I've got another tall tale for you.</PRE>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 gossip mongers:  3.</PRE>
