<P>   Why are Americans so fascinated with Europe that they
travel there in great numbers, and if Europe is so wonderful,
why do so many Europeans come to the United States on
their three-week vacations?  Obviously we all crave change--
the chance to break way from our daily routines to see how
the other side lives, secretly hoping to find that the grass is
not really greener on the other side of the fence.  For Phoebe
O'Connor (Jordana Brewster), her maiden trip from San
Francisco to the streets and hills of the Netherlands, France,
Germany and Portugal were for a different reason.  She is a
person following a dream--not the dream of "finding herself"
as so many people seem to think that a couple of months in
the Old World will achieve but of a chance to discover how
the sister she adored lost her life, her crumpled body found
on the rocks below the steep hills of Portugal's tiny village of 
Cabo Espichel.  What makes her voyage to the Continent of
particular interest is that Phoebe is anything but a party
animal: she is someone who finds that she cannot fit in
anywhere and yet she takes off alone at the age of 18
despite the refusal of her otherwise hip mother, Gail (Blythe
Danner), to grant permission.</P>
<P>   This is yet another coming-of-age drama.  I suppose many
in the audience will find it to be a woman's picture, a chick
flick, and "The Invisible Circus" is that, but there's more to
the story than a focus on a young, sheltered, introverted
woman who changes her life by taking her first real initiatives. 
The tale involves the politics of the early seventies, the time
that young people, especially students, were rebelling
thorughout most of the Western world against what they
considered their warmongering governments and against
large corporations who supplied the materials needed to kill.  </P>
<P>   Faith (Cameron Diaz), who is Phoebe's older sister, has
grown up in a middle-class home in San Francisco, adoring
her father who returns the affection and incurring the jealousy
of her mother thereby.  Apparently bored with the security
which her life provides, she is determined to make a
difference in the world and, this being the late sixties, she
pulls a Patty Hearst and joins up with revolutionary groups
who commit robberies and worse to bring down their
governments.  While at first enjoying a romantic relationship
with Wolf (Christopher Eccleston), she ultimately breaks
away, finding her boyfriend too timid about taking on so-
called oppressive governments.  When her body is found in
Portugal in 1970, sister Phoebe is determined to find out how
she died.</P>
<P>   Conventional though the story telling may be, "The Invisible
Circus"--an ironic title given that the expression refers to a
European fun-house--is an involving tale featuring a solid 
performance by the comely nineteen year old actress,
Jordana Brewster.  Brewster has us caught up in her
adventure, making us empathize with her conflicts and
compulsions, leading us to appreciate how her bonding with
her sister's former boy friend Wolf could lead into her very
first sizzling romance...and in this movie the couple do indeed
sizzle.  Christopher Eccleston, who does not know how to
give a poor performance, is perfectly cast although Cameron
Diaz, who could easily pass as the daughter of Blythe
Danner, appears too old for the role.  Diaz at one point is
even asked to portray a girl of about twelve, and not too
successfully.</P>
<P>   The story moves forward smoothly, with Adam Brooks's
cameraman Henry Braham taking us on a Cook's tour of
some high spots in Europe in both meanings of the term,
though we wonder whether Brooks is geographically
challenged.  Did we really see Phoebe cross directly from
France into Portugal?  (No mention whatever is made in the
production notes that she spent even a moment on Spanish
soil.)</P>
<P>   "The Invisible Circus," then, is a substantially fine
adaptation of an novelist Jennifer Egan's bildungsroman, with
both Jordana Brewster and vivid scenes from the Continent
most pleasing to the eye.</P>
