<P>Batman & Robin: Freeze Adds Warmth but Poison Ivy Irritates</P>
<P>Somewhere in the middle of the movie, Bruce Wayne reflects on his firm   
need for control and asks his longtime-faithful friend and servant,   
Alfred, for his opinion.  Alfred's response is an apt one.  "What is   
Batman if not an attempt to master the chaos that surrounds us."   
 However, while the Dark Knight has the ability to master his own   
destiny, Joel Schumacher, the director of this and the last Batman movie   
(Batman Forever) doesn't really have the talent to master the amount of   
chaos that runs rampant through this latest movie featuring the caped   
crusader.</P>
<P>What we get is an offering filled with ingredients that don't necessarily   
compliment each other or ingredients that get completely lost in the mix.   
 And that's too bad, because the movie begins with a terrific punch as we   
are introduced to two developing story lines.  One is the emergence of   
Batman's latest superfoe, Mr Freeze, played by the imposing Arnold   
Schwarzenegger.  His story is actually quite poignant - as a leading   
scientist, he has cryogenically frozen his wife who suffers from a rare   
disease for which there is no known cure.  While trying to discover a   
cure, he accidentally falls into a vat of cryogenic fluid.  His body   
mutates and now he can only survive in extremely cold temperatures.  He   
wears a cold suit, wields an ice ray gun and must steal diamonds to not   
only power his suit but to complete his superweapon for reasons that are   
equally nefarious as they are noble.  And, we also begin to see Robin's   
desire for more respect, more trust, and more equality in the   
crimefighting partnership.  Perhaps a Robin signal would do?   This   
simmering rift between the two crimefighters evolves into an interesting   
look into their partnership.  Unfortunately, it is one of 8 different   
storylines…which is about 5 too many.</P>
<P>For example, there is also a warm piece centered on Alfred's   
deteriorating health, the comeuppance of Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone),   
the creation of another foe in the form of Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman), and   
Bruce Waynes's road towards possible marriage.  It gets very difficult to   
filter out all of these stories because there is so much to explore that   
not enough time could be adequately given to the stories that could have   
made this the best of the Batman movies.  There is a veritable buffet of   
stories and sub-plots.  Additionally, we are treated to stunning visual   
effects and gorgeous set pieces.  The gargoyles that overlook Gotham   
City, the menacing shadows that tease the streets below, and the stunning   
architecture are incredible.  Those cool set pieces could go head-to-head   
with those in Blade Runner or the 5th Element.  However, they tend to   
distract us from the really good stuff.</P>
<P>Personally, I would have preferred Mr. Freeze as the lone villain and   
more time devoted to Batman v. Robin instead of Batman & Robin.  Also,   
giving more screen time to Alfred was a good move.  These are the stories   
that could've really carried the movie.  If you haven't seen it yet, but   
decide to, these stories are the ones that you should try to concentrate   
on.  You can filter out the rest.  Surprisingly, the alluringly kinky   
Poison Ivy didn't do that much to "bud" my interest as Mr. Freeze's   
partner in crime - she just seemed out of the mix.</P>
<P>Clooney makes a fine Bruce Wayne (better than Val Kilmer), who not only   
looks great in the Batsuit, but also possesses some depth.  Ah-nold and   
Uma Thurman also seem to relish their roles.  Chris O'Donnell (Robin) is   
as perky as ever, and Michael Gough (Alfred) is reliably good as Wayne   
Manor's caretaker.  However, I was not particularly taken either way with   
the inclusion of Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl.</P>
<P>After the strong start, things start to get bogged down as all of the   
story lines come into play.  It becomes a jungle of underdeveloped or   
semi-developed plots.  But there is sufficient action to keep us   
interested in the conclusions and lots of eye candy to keep us visually   
stimulated.  Additionally, a fairly strong ending helps to rescue this   
movie from becoming a frozen wasteland.  Ah…style over substance ˜ a   
common dilemma for summer movies.  But, if your idea of a good time in   
summer is simply to see a movie that moves, has lots and lots of combat   
toys and swirling action, then Batman & Robin will help you in your   
crusade.</P>
