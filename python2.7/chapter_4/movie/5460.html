<P>     This is how far I trust John Sayles' skill as a writer:  in the few
hours after I saw LONE STAR, when I couldn't quite get the pieces to fit
together, I figured _I_ had to be missing something.  Perhaps more than
any other filmmaker's next project, I look forward to the next John Sayles
project like a Christmas gift.  While he is still growing as a director,
his scripts are so unapologetically and relentlessly literate -- and
literary -- that unwrapping them is its own kind of pleasure.  LONE STAR,
as much as any film of the last several years, is a novel on the screen,
and a marvelous one.  When I finally did put those pieces together, I
realized how justified my faith had been.</P>
<P>     LONE STAR takes place in the Texas border town of Frontera, where two
men make a discovery near a former Army firing range:  a human skeleton
which appears to be the remains of Charley Wade (Kris Kristofferson), the
corrupt sheriff who used to run Frontera with an iron hand and an open
pocket.  The discovery is of great interest to current sheriff Sam Deeds
(Chris Cooper), whose late father Buddy followed Charley as sheriff and
became a beloved figure.  But Sam's own feelings about Buddy are
ambivalent, and when he begins to believe that Buddy might have been the
man who killed Charley Wade, he becomes determined to find out the truth.
That quest has Sam crossing paths with several townspeople, including
Pilar Cruz (Elizabeth Pena), a high school teacher and Sam's old flame;
mayor Hollis Page (Clifton James), formerly one of Charley's deputies; and
bar owner Otis Payne (Ron Canada).  Each one holds part of the key to a
forty year old mystery.</P>
<P>     On its most basic level, LONE STAR is a superbly acted study of life
in a border town.  The cast is uniformly in tune with Sayles' naturalistic
style, particularly Chris Cooper in a subtle but powerful performance as
Sam; even Frances McDormand, as Sam's manic-depressive ex-wife, lends
humanity to an edgy role in her single scene.  The multi-ethnic cast
provides a solid foundation for an examination of a place where the
"melting pot" is anything but.  The white townspeople feel overrun by the
Mexican-Americans, the blacks only feel comfortable in Otis' roadhouse,
and even some Mexican-American's like Pilar's restauranteur mother
Mercedes (Miriam Colon)express disdain for recent illegal immigrants and
their failure to assimilate.  It is a place which, while less overtly
racist than it was during Charley Wade's reign in the 1950s, is still
characterized by an omnipresent sense of "us" and "them."</P>
<P>     That is one of two crucial sub-texts of LONE STAR, both of which are
intrinsic to its South Texas setting.  This is a story about borders of
all kinds, set in a town which is named after the Spanish word for
"border."  Fathers and sons are divided by old emotional wounds, lovers
are separated by race, and everyone seems to be separated from the truth
by pre-conceptions about what the truth should be.  And that is the other
thread running through LONE STAR:  the nature of history.  In an early
scene, parents of various ethnicities sit in Pilar's classroom arguing
over the way she is teaching the Battle of the Alamo, the white parents
attacking her for suggesting that there is another perspective from which
it could be viewed.  The idea that history is personal is troubling,
because it destabilizes the past, and when history has crossed over into
legend, there will be many who prefer solidity.  That is the truth Sam
discovers as his investigation challenges the memory of his legendary
father:  myth has a power which simple facts cannot hope to match.</P>
<P>     These rich themes were always evident as I watched LONE STAR, but I
was bothered by a seemingly tangential sub-plot involving Otis Payne's
estranged son Del (Joe Morton), returned to Frontera with his family after
many years to act as commanding officer at the local army base.  Then,
finally, I saw it as absolutely crucial.  Del, like Sam, harbors
resentment towards his father; unlike Sam, his father is still alive.
Sam's investigation can only bring him so close to Buddy, and it is
telling that Buddy (played by Matthew McConaughey) appears only briefly in
the flashbacks which Sayles weaves through LONE STAR.  Sam and Buddy
are separated by an uncrossable border -- the border of history -- while
Del finds himself with a chance to be re-united with his father.  At times
it seems that Sayles is suggesting that the only history that has a chance
of being re-interpreted is the history which has yet to be created.</P>
<P>     LONE STAR is a haunting film, which deals with unexpectedly delicate
subject matter with startling confidence.  The experience of watching the
film sticks with me because I didn't just sit through two hours of film; I
was reading people's lives.  That is the kind of filmmaker John Sayles is:
an author with a camera.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 closed borders:  10.</PRE>
