<P>     While watching LOSER, it occurred to me that Amy Heckerling's true
genius as a film-maker is casting. In FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, she
gave us Sean Penn's Jeff Spicoli; in LOOK WHO'S TALKING, she turned Bruce
Willis into a wise-cracking baby and provided John Travolta with is first
career revival; in CLUELESS, she found a star vehicle for the adorableness
that is (or was) Alicia Silverstone. She seems to understand instinctively
how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws. 
Unfortunately, she may also be starting to understand that she 
understands. Giving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable
movies. Giving appealing actors a script in which their appeal _is_ the
movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like LOSER.</P>
<P>     Naturally, Heckerling makes her protagonist an all-around swell
guy. Paul Tannek (Jason Biggs) is a small-town boy who gets a scholarship
to NYU, then instantly finds himself an island of compassion and diligence
in the cold-hearted big city. Paul is the kind of guy who gives up his
seat on the subway to an elderly woman; his roommates Adam (Zak Orth),
Chris (Tom Sadoski) and Noah (Jimmi Simpson) are the kind of guys who
blast their music and let their waterbeds leak all over Paul. Paul is also
the kind of guy who adores girls from afar, in this case the lovely Dora
Diamond (Mena Suvari). Dora has problems of her own, including a shortage
of funds to pay her tuition and a relationship with a professor, Edward
Alcott (Greg Kinnear), that's more than slightly one-sided. They're two
conscientious kids who love animals and homeless people, so clearly they
belong together, even if Paul is a loser.</P>
<P>     I must confess that, for a while, I was suckered in by Heckerling's
casting. Jason Biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks
make him even easier to embrace; Suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent
of intelligence. They're pleasant enough to watch, and Heckerling gives us
plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their
respective antagonists aren't. Then it gradually becomes clear that
there's virtually nothing to LOSER but scenes of that sort. In theory,
LOSER is a romantic comedy, but there is scarcely a laugh to be found in
the entire film (notable exception: a cameo by a scene-stealing comic
actor as a video store clerk). Instead of taking any time to make the
characters' situations funny, Heckerling spends 98 minutes making her
characters' situations pathetic. She shows none of the ear for quirky
dialogue that sparked CLUELESS, nor any of that film's interest in lively
plotting (not surprisingly, since CLUELESS's plot came via Jane Austen's
EMMA). She simply turns the film into a pity party.</P>
<P>     Since LOSER is a film composed almost entirely of establishing
character, you might think that those characters would be interesting, or
at least slightly complicated. Instead, you have people either so perfect
or so unredeemable that there's no reason to watch them. Paul isn't just a
nice guy, he's flawless; consequently, he's a central character who does
absolutely no growing. His roommates aren't just inconsiderate, they're
actively evil-blackmailing Professor Alcott, drugging women with Rohypnol
and generally giving humanity a bad name. And Professor Alcott isn't just
manipulative, he turns Dora into his house slave. Dora's unthinking
devotion to Alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in
LOSER, and even that isn't explored in sufficient detail. There's more
ambiguity in the 30-second snippet from Alan Cumming's Broadway 
performance as the Emcee in CABARET then there is in the rest of LOSER 
It's one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations; 
it's another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush. And it
would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow ... I don't know
... comic.</P>
<P>     Still, I spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that
Heckerling would somehow salvage LOSER from its tedium and justify my
desire to like Paul and Dora. That hope dissolved the moment Heckerling
underscored a sequence of Paul in the throes of unrequited love to Simon
and Garfunkel's "Scarborough Fair/Canticle." Instead of giving the
sequence a knowing wink-a reference to THE GRADUATE, a hint that Paul is
becoming an overly-sensitive clich-Heckerling plays it deadly straight. 
Even in the scenes that scream for a light comic touch and a bit of a poke
at her protagonist's foibles, she finds it impossible to stray from the
Gospel of Paul as Saint. CLUELESS's Cher had her self-absorption and
manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness. In LOSER, Amy Heckerling
shows a leaden hand with material that demands friskiness (her one show of
wit involves naming Paul's dorm "Hunt's Hall" after erstwhile Bowery Boy
Huntz Hall). Her gift with casting proved to be her curse. LOSER may be a
crashing bore, but gee, aren't those two kids swell?</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 plastic casts:  4.</PRE>
