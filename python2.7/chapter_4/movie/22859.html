<P> Starring Antonio Banderas, Woody Harrelson, Lolita Davidovich, Tom
Sizemore, Lucy Liu. Directed by Ron Shelton. Rated R.</P>
<P>With all the fuss that was made about Fight Club, it was a hell of a
letdown when the movie turned out to suck. Well, for all of us that
were sorely disappointed by the misbegotten David Fincher satire, along
comes Ron Shelton's Play It to the Bone, a film that deals with the
same themes in a similar fashion but is actually good. Funny, exciting,
sometimes profound and kind of sweet, it upstages the pretentious, mean-
spirited Fight Club in every way possible.</P>
<P>This movie has had the fiercest advertising campaign for a non-event
movie in recent memory, so regular moviegoers should have had the plot
drilled into their heads already. If not, it's very simple: Cesar
Dominguez and Vince Boudreau, two failed, over-the-hill middleweight
boxers, receive a phone call while they're training in the gym one
afternoon. It seems that the undercard fight for Mike Tyson can't take
place -- one of the boxers is dead and the other is stoned out of his
mind. Big-time Las Vegas program coordinators headed by Tom Sizemore
need two boxers desperately. They're willing to give Dominguez and
Boudreau $50,000 a piece and a guaranteed shot at a title if they come
to Las Vegas and fight each other that night.</P>
<P>They enlist the companionship and support (as well as the vehicle) of
Grase Pasic (Lolita Davidovich), an indecisive woman who, at some
point, had a relationship with both boxers; 6 years with Vince and 6
months with Cesar. Together they drive to Vegas (taking a detour, of
course, to look at rock striations). During the drive, Cesar tells
about his experimentation with homosexuality, as well as his crushing
loss in Madison Square Garden years prior. Soon, Cesar and Vince start
bickering, obviously trying to make it easier to hit each other later.</P>
<P>Along the way, they pick up a hitchhiker (Lucy Liu), who proceeds to
seduce Vince and piss off Grace. Tom Sizemore shouts and curses for
almost all of his screen time. Grace Pasic seems like a great woman and
Cesar and Vince are people we don't mind spending time with. By the
time the all-important match approaches, we feel like the outcome
matters because the characters have really grown on us during the past
two hours.</P>
<P>Some writers have attacked this movie for the neutrality of its
climactic bout, offering the fact that we can't really root for either
contestant as a quibble. That is probably the most absurd criticism of
a movie that I've ever heard, this side of the idiots who chastised
Eyes Wide Shut for being unerotic. The fight is exciting precisely
because we don't know whom to root for. Rooting isn't the point and
that's exactly the intention. Shelton aims beyond the basic
entertainment value of a "big game" moment.</P>
<P>Antonio Banderas has finally found a role where his accent suits him
well and Harrelson was born to play Vince. But the real discovery here
is Lolita Davidovich. The 38-year-old Canadian-born actress recently
had smaller parts in Gods and Monsters and Mystery, Alaska, but her
breakthrough comes here. She brings a vital intelligence and sweetness
to the role, forming a likable character whom we have no trouble
accepting as an emotional catalyst for Cesar and Vince. When she's on
screen, the movie can do no wrong.</P>
<P>Ron Shelton has a passion and an eye for sports movies, previously
directing the Kevin Costner baseball vehicle Bull Durham as well as the
Harrelson/Wesley Snipes basketball movie White Men Can Jump. He directs
Play It to the Bone with a sure hand, never afraid to take his time but
also not forgetting to make things interesting. The climax is a
screaming menagerie of camera tricks so skillfully put together you
can't take your eyes off the screen.</P>
<P>It's not uncommon for relatively modest flicks like this one to be
lambasted from nearly every direction while pretentious crap like The
Hurricane is met with nearly unanimous critical hosannas. I'll hold my
ground as a staunch defender of the innocent</P>
