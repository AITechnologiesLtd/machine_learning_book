written and directed by Allison Anders and Kurt Voss</P>
<P>Good friends Allison Anders and Kurt Voss are each experienced
filmmakers.  They started out with their $50,000 collaboration on the
L.A. punk rock scene, "Border Radio", and have watched their work
evolve from edgy, alternative indie to mainstream, formulaic
Hollywood.  Anders had made three critically acclaimed films which
told stories from a woman's perspective, and Voss had directed a
handful of films which ended up either faltering on cable or delving
into obscurity. Either way, both decided it was time for a change.</P>
<P>Anders and Voss were looking to recapture that independent spirit
which was so evident in "Border Radio", and decided to conceive and
make a movie without any hassle. For their second collaborative
effort, they decided to once again visit the L.A. music scene, for a
behind the scenes look at the ambition and failure in the rock music
industry. In less than two weeks, they wrote "Sugar Town", and started
production less than a month later. Then, in January, the film
premiered at Sundance Film Festival '99, just six months after Allison
Anders and Kurt Voss put their pens to paper.</P>
<P>As a rabid supporter of the independent film scene, this act of daring
and unconventionality pleased me immensely. But sadly, "Sugar Town"
turns out to be a film that emphasizes the contraints of a low budget
rather than the creative freedom allowed by such an endeavor. "Sugar
Town" is an ensemble comedy in the "Short Cuts" vein that has its
moments, but never gets off its feet.</P>
<P>"Sugar Town" involves a cross section of individuals who are either
climbing the ladder of ambition or who are at 14:59 in their fame
clock. All are involved somehow in a hit or miss business, where a
sure thing today can be a has been tomorrow. There is Gwen (newcomer
Jade Gordon), a ruthlessly ambitious housemaid, Liz (Ally Sheedy), a
movie production designer who is taken advantage of at every turn, Eva
(Rosanna Arquette), an aging actress married to has been 80's rocker
Clive (John Taylor), who is trying to get his new band off the ground.</P>
<P>These people are unified only by their desire to be the next big
thing, despite their age, sex and class differences. But we, the
viewers, never see any developed, human characters.  Instead, we see
dull caricatures that are but pawns in a poorly conceived game. Every
once in a while, there is a clever gesture (the self deprecating rock
stars are played by members of once prominent 80's bands), but "Sugar
Town" ends up feeling more sour than sweet.</P>
<P>As an ensemble film, "Sugar Town" also falters. The few segments which
are most interesting are the ones paid least attention to (which gives
way to some painfully tacky subplots), and the way the characters are
tied together is a bland condescension. "Sugar Town" is short, but
feels long, and the script was not only written in a hurry, but it
feels that way too. The saving grace is the few women characters
(obviously written by Allison Anders), played by Jade Gordon, Rosanna
Arquette, and Ally Sheedy that hold our attention whenever on
screen. Gordon, who had a small role in Anders' "Grace Of My Heart",
shows potential in her role as the vicious Gwen.  Arquette and Sheedy
stay low-key, but are nevertheless effective.</P>
<P>Allison Anders is, in my opinion, a talent with strong views, but a
knack for inconsistency. Her best work is her first sole effort, "Gas
Food Lodging", a semi autobiographical story of a girl growing up in a
small New Mexico town. Her poorest work can be seen in her segment of
"Four Rooms", which was also co-directed by Quentin Tarantino, Robert
Rodriguez and Alexandre Rockwell.</P>
<P>"Sugar Town" has its moments, but it's lacking an edge found in so
many other studies of Hollywood industry. The film ultimately never
really ends, and doesn't provoke much thought. If "Sugar Town" was a
stronger film, it could have been a good argument for more independent
film funding.  However, like its title, "Sugar Town" ends up being
meaningless; a movie that is unprovocative and uncompromising, never
becoming what you want it to be.</P>
