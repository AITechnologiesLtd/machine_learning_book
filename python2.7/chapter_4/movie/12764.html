<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>There's a unique feeling of desperation intertwined with the events
that unfold in Wayne Wang's Chinese Box.  The film tells the story of a
man named John (Jeremy Irons) during the last few months of British
colonialism in Hong Kong.  John has lived in Hong Kong for fifteen
years, though he feels that he doesn't know his home at all.  He takes
pictures of the city, and writes about it, but nothing he says or feels
is certain or concrete.  The only thing he knows without doubt is that
he loves Vivian (Gong Li).  </P>
<P>Vivian, however, is an ex-prostitute who is associated with Chang
(Michael Hui); she wants to marry Chang and raise a family with him, but
his social standing ensures that he can not ever have such a
relationship with an ex-prostitute.  Vivian clearly has strong feelings
for John, but refuses to make them known to him.  Somewhere in the
middle of all this, John meets a woman named Jean (Maggie Cheung), who
dresses with eccentricity and seems to live a strange and vibrant
existence.  He tries to interview her, to find out about the scar that
covers half her face, but she's resistant at first.  Soon, a strange
parallel develops between his relationship with the two women.  </P>
<P>Wayne Wang has directed several other pictures, but the only one I've
seen is Smoke.  I didn't enjoy that film, but now that I can compare it
with Chinese Box, it is clear to me that Wang is not a one-trick film
maker.  There is so much to admire about Chinese Box, but I think the
most interesting aspect is Wang's consistent tone and atmosphere.  Every
scene is shot with a handheld camera, and this gives the film a jittery,
in-the-moment feeling.  It also keeps the film in John's perspective,
and this is a good decision because it keeps the setting foreign, and
even a little bit threatening.  The atmosphere is eerie and very
effective.</P>
<P>Wang's execution of his story (which was actually written by Larry
Gross and Jean-Claude Carriere) also helps to characterize the three
main people in his story.  John, played by Irons with that flustered
strength that Irons always manifests so effortlessly, is a
well-developed and interesting character, and a perfect type of person
to place at the center of this story.  Early in the film, he learns that
he has leukemia, and that he probably only has about six months to live,
and this puts a fascinating dimension onto his actions.</P>
<P>His associations with these two enigmatic women is really at the heart
of the story.  There are climactic scenes with both Vivian and Jean, and
both of these moments are perfectly created by Wang.  The best scene in
the film is towards the end, and it comes about when Vivian leaves Chang
to revert to her prostitute life; John finds her, and she puts on her
act for him, but he manages to break it down and prove to her that his
feelings are true.  This scene is perfect moviemaking, and is strong
mostly because of the acting.</P>
<P>Gong Li is a beautiful, talented actress, and is wonderful here in a
quiet, understated way.  Cheung's performance is entirely different, but
complex in that it's clear that she's hiding almost everything about
herself that's important to her.  The presence of these two interesting
female characters is one of the most prominent strengths of Chinese Box.</P>
<P>Wang does, however, make a couple of severe missteps that have
surprisingly strong negative effects on the film.  There is one scene
that completely disrupts the film's detached sense of frenzy -- it's a
series of shots in which John is in the hospital, learning that his
cancer is fatal, and then he goes outside and sits; during all of this,
horribly sentimental music twangs in the background (it's actually
performed by Ruben Blades, who plays John's friend Jim).  It changes the
tone of the film so abruptly that I was literally ripped from the
picture just at the moment when I wanted to be most absorbed in it.</P>
<P>Wang also seems uncertain about his reasoning for placing his story
against the backdrop of the disintegration of British colonialism in
Hong Kong.  It's something that he clearly feels strongly about, but
Chinese Box isn't long enough to focus on this fascinating love story
and still make a meaningful political statement.  Aside from these
elements, however, I can do nothing but enthusiastically recommend this
film -- Wang is a gifted film maker, and he has done a fantastic job of
creating a unique love story that draws you in and forces you to care.</P>
