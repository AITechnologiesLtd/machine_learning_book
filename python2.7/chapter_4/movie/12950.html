<P>     My concept of a "family film" is a movie that can be enjoyed by 
viewers of all ages:  undiscriminating young children, teenagers with 
short attention spans, and adults with somewhat more refined standards.  
Unfortunately, too often Hollywood equates a "family film" with 
something aimed at the under-10 crowd.  While Disney's live-action 
pictures have often fallen victim to this approach, the corporation's 
animated features have remained largely exempt (although it's possible 
to argue about how widespread HERCULES' appeal is).  MULAN, Disney's 
36th animated movie, continues this trend.  Arguably the most mature of 
the eight "new wave" (post-1988, beginning with THE LITTLE MERMAID) 
films, MULAN effortlessly blends serious, comic, and cute elements into 
a whole that should entertain the majority of movie-goers, regardless of 
race, gender, or age.</P>
<P>     Over the past few years, the Disney animated films have been in a 
state of constant quality erosion.  This slippage has left the door open 
for other production companies' challengers, such as Fox's ANASTASIA, 
which applied the Disney formula with greater success than was evident 
in the Mouse's recent entries.  MULAN not only reverses this unfortunate 
tendency, but re-affirms Disney as Hollywood's premiere animation 
factory.  MULAN is better than either ANASTASIA or the disappointing THE 
QUEST FOR CAMELOT, and represents the most impressive animated offering 
since THE LION KING.  Adults will appreciate the depth of 
characterization while kids will love Mulan's sidekick, a colorful 
dragon named Mushu.  Everyone will be entertained the fast-moving plot 
and rich animation.</P>
<P>     The setting for this latest adventure is feudal China.  An army of 
Huns under the command of the ruthless Shan-Yu (voice of Miguel Ferrer), 
has invaded the country, spreading death and disaster far and wide.  The 
Chinese Emperor (Pat Morita) commands that one able-bodied male from 
every family must serve in an emergency army.  Meanwhile, in a remote 
village, an independent-minded young woman named Mulan (Ming-Na Wen) has 
been rejected by a local matchmaker on the grounds that she is too 
willful.  "You will never bring your family honor," decrees the 
matchmaker, causing Mulan to begin a period of soul-searching. When the 
Emperor's decree arrives, Mulan cuts her hair, dresses like a man, and 
enters the army in her father's place.  With the help of her inept 
mythical guardian, the tiny dragon Mushu (Eddie Murphy), she seeks to 
win the confidence of her captain, Li Shang (B.D. Wong), and the 
acceptance of her fellow peasant-turned-warriors, while keeping her sex 
concealed from everyone.</P>
<P>     MULAN is the first Disney animated film to deal with war and death 
on a large scale.  The subject is not glossed over – the movie features 
several poignant sequences showing the devastation in the aftermath of a 
battle, including hundreds of lifeless bodies lying in the snow.  Oddly, 
because there's nothing exploitative or gruesome about these images, 
they're more likely to affect older viewers, who will better understand 
the implications, than younger ones, for whom death is often a nebulous 
concept.  In no way can it be said that MULAN is glorifying war.</P>
<P>     The main character is cut from a familiar cloth.  Although she 
looks different from Ariel, Belle, Jasmine, and Pocahontas, Mulan is 
very much the same type of individual:  a woman with a strong, 
independent streak who is unwilling to bend to the customs of her 
culture, which decree that the role of the female is to be ornamental.  
The film isn't very subtle in reinforcing the idea of equality between 
the sexes, but the script contains a few amusing lines in this vein that 
will fly high over the heads of younger viewers. </P>
<P>     As all Disney movies must, MULAN features a pair of new sidekicks.  
One, the second best-known cartoon cricket in the history of motion 
pictures, doesn't have a voice.  The other, Mushu, never shuts up.  It's 
clear that, in his vocal characterization of the dragon, Eddie Murphy is 
trying to top (or at least equal) Robin Williams' genie from ALADDIN.  
Amazingly, he comes close.  With his high-energy, often hilarious 
delivery (I'd bet money there was more than a little improvisation 
involved), Murphy flies away with his scenes.  Mushu is the primary 
reason kids will love MULAN, and he's not so fundamentally juvenile that 
adults won't get a few chuckles out of him, as well.</P>
<P>     If there's a disappointment in MULAN, it's the villain.  Shan-Yu is 
not going to place high in the Disney Bad Guys Hall of Fame.  The 
problem isn't that he's not nasty, because, with his scowling features, 
glaring eyes, and Darth Vader-like mannerisms, he's one of the most 
vicious men ever to appear in a Disney animated feature.  Rather, it's 
his lack of screen time.  Shan-Yu isn't around long enough for audiences 
to truly hate him.  The final showdown is anti-climactic because he 
seems more like an afterthought than a major player.</P>
<P>     Unsurprisingly, the animation is top-notch.  The film has a unique 
look for an animated motion picture, using many more unusual camera 
angles than have previously been attempted in this kind of effort.  
There are the typically spectacular sequences:  the opening shot of the 
Great Wall of China, scenes of a charging army, and the sight of a 
village in blazing ruins.  In addition, the artists conquered an unusual 
challenge – to change the appearance of a cartoon character so that she 
looks like a male but is still obviously the same (female) person.  </P>
<P>     MULAN doesn't rely upon occasional double entendres to earn its 
acceptance with adults.  Some of the dialogue is specifically aimed at 
an older audience.  There's not so much that children will become 
confused or bored, but there's enough for Mom and Dad not to feel like 
they're being ignored or talked down to.  It's also worth noting that 
MULAN is surprisingly light on songs, featuring only four or five 
(depending on how you count).  Written by the team of Matthew Wilder and 
David Zippel, these are an improvement over what we were subject to in 
POCAHONTAS, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, and HERCULES.  </P>
<P>     After several years of less-than-stellar entries, Disney has 
rebounded with MULAN, which once again raises the bar for animated 
quality.  Now, if only the production company would apply the same 
effort to their live-action features.  Then I might not cringe at the 
thought of reviewing any non-animated offering from the Magic Kingdom.</P>
