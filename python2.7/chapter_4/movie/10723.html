<PRE>HARD RAIN</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>After stalling for nearly a year, Hard Rain finally makes it to the box
office.  Previously titled The Flood, the filmmakers quickly renamed it
after the deluge of disaster pics, so as not to have it drown in the
public's eye.  In a way, it's fitting, since the disaster portion of the
film is merely a backdrop, not the main focus.  The heart of the film is
a heist picture, albeit one with an ever present supply of water to
provide additional difficulties.  But all in all, the film is not a
disaster in itself.</P>
<P>The small town of Huntingburg is being flooded.  The sheriff (Randy
Quaid) is evacuating the citizenry, even though he lost the recent
election. He and his deputies, however, will be staying to protect the
town from looters, as the sheriff feels doing his job well is the best
revenge.</P>
<P>Also anticipating looters are the local banks.  An armored car, guarded
by Tom (Christian Slater) and Charlie (Ed Asner), is emptying the vaults
of banks up and down the river.</P>
<P>That truck is the target of a group of thieves (led by Morgan Freeman),
who are using the torrential rains to their unexpected advantage.
However, the heist doesn't go exactly as planned:  Tom escapes and
manages to hide the money.</P>
<P>Soon, the band of theives is after Tom to find the hidden money, and the
police don't know whether to trust Tom or lock him away as a potential
looter.</P>
<P>There is a good setup in Hard Rain, with the three sides (the thieves,
the cops, and the hero), each having its own idiosyncracies.  The ragtag
group of robbers is the most interesting, containing not only Freeman
but an ex-science teacher (Dan Florek), a trigger-happy bible-quoting
thug, and a nervous neophyte.</P>
<P>However, after this setup, the characterization goes nowhere.  Morgan
Freeman simply plays the part of "Morgan Freeman as a kindly but
desperate thief", and we're never given any hows or whys for his
character. The same goes for all the other characters as well, who offer
no real surprises (especially if you've seen the spoiler-filled
trailer).  Christian Slater and fellow flood victim Minnie Driver are
paired off, but there's no more depth to their relationship than to
their characters.</P>
<P>While we're on the subject of screenwriting, the dialogue isn't
particularly deep, either.  There are times that it's servicable for
fueling the bare minimums of an action picture, but others (particularly
the comic relief) are purely atrocious. One entire subplot, involving an
elderly civilian couple (Betty White and Richard Dysart) severely needed
to be axed.</P>
<P>But all that said, the movie does work, on its own terms.  This is
nothing that's going to win an Academy Award, but for thrills and
excitement, it will deliver bang for your (matinee) dollar.  A flood
might not be in the same class as volcanoes, twisters and earthquakes,
but after seeing this film you sure don't want to be in one.</P>
<P>The best advice is to watch this film without questioning too many of
the details.  (Such as...with all the shotgun blasts going on, why
doesn't anyone's boat get holed?)  But if you sit back and simply enjoy
the mindless peril, you'll have a decent time.</P>
