<PRE>The Ice Pirates
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Robert Urich; Mary Crosby; Anjelica Huston; Ron Perlman & Michael
D. Roberts</P>
<P>Cheesy from the word go. But I enjoyed it. I have to say that The Ice
Pirates holds a few memories for me. When I first saw it in a theater, oh so
many years ago, it was the first movie that I had ever seen in a theater
with any sort of sexually suggestive dialogue. Quite the shock. It is also
the very first movie I ever rented when I got my very first VCR. I didn't
get it because it was so spectacular the first time around, but because it
was Christmas and there wasn't a great selection in the video store.
Watching this time, I was surprised at just how packed to the max with
cheese this sucker really was. Although, that seems to be the intention of
the filmmakers. I can't imagine that they ever expected anyone to take this
film too seriously.</P>
<P>The Ice Pirates is set in a distant galaxy where ongoing wars have depleted
the galaxy of water. So the most precious commodity is ice, and the evil
rulers of the galaxy control that. Robert Urich (yes, Spencer: For Hire)
plays an ice pirate who makes his living hijacking transport ships filled
with shipments of ice. His crew is a motley band of scoundrels including
Anjelica Huston. (Yes, that Anjelica Huston). On one of these raids, Urich
runs into a beautiful princess (Mary Crosby -- Bing's daughter). He ends up
falling for her and the two of them go off looking for her father -- who has
disappeared. This is a big simplification, but to be honest, in The Ice
Pirates, I don't think plot was ever something that anyone was real
concerned about.</P>
<P>The movie is filled with every plot device, prop and cheesy special effect
that can possibly be crammed into one film. All with seemingly the same
purpose -- the specific intent of making this film as cheesy as possible.
These range from the space herpe that infects the ice pirate's ship. To the
high-speed effects which are used when the ship hits a time warp. I'm not
even going to bother getting into the robots that populate this film.</P>
<P>Actually commenting on the performances of this film seems pointless.
Everyone in this movie seems to be giving 110% effort at making their
performances as over the top as the possible as they can without actually
breaking up laughing during a line of dialogue. Bad. Bad. Bad. Since that is
what they were going for, they can be excused somewhat.</P>
<P>If there were one compliment that I could give The Ice Pirates, it would be
that nobody would ever confuse it for a good movie. But I still had fun
watching it again.</P>
