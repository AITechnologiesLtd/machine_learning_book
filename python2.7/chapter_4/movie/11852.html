<PRE>"Gummo" (USA, 1997)
A Film Review by James Kendrick</PRE>
<P>Director: Harmony Korine / Screenwriter: Harmony
Korine / Stars: Jacob Reynolds (Solomon), Nick
Sutton (Tummler), Jacob Sewell (Bunny Boy), Darby
Dougherty (Darby), Chloe Sevigny (Dot), Max
Perlich (Cole), Carisa Bara (Helen), Linda Manz
(Solomon's Mom) / MPAA Rating: R / Review: No
Stars (out of ****).</P>
<P>Rest assured, it is never too late for the
cinematic medium to hit a new low.</P>
<P>The bottom rung of the moviegoing ladder, which
has been littered with such lonely disgraces as
"Caligula" (1980) and "I Spit On Your Grave"
(1978), must now  make room for "Gummo," the
atrocious and horrendously pretentious new "film"
from Harmony Korine. Apparently, Korine needed
more than the fifteen minutes of fame he garnered
for writing the screenplay for "Kids" (1995),
Larry Clark's effective, but overpraised
examination of disillusioned youth in New York
City.</P>
<P>"Gummo" represents everything that can possibly be
bad about a movie. It revels in the filth and
squalor of the worst variations of human
existence, without giving any true insight or
understanding about the predicaments of its
pathetic characters. Some have (laughably) called
the movie an attack on bourgeois taste and values,
but one doesn't need to look so high. "Gummo" is
an all-out assault on fundamental human decency,
and worst of all, it's not funny, interesting, or
in the least bit entertaining. It has a sort of
curious shock value for all of ten minutes, then
it just bogs down into its own rut of
grotesqueries.</P>
<P>The movie is filled with slightly related
vignettes that take place in the small,
dilapidated town of Xenia, Ohio, all of whose
residents are either uneducated rednecks, morally
depraved children, or the mentally incapacitated.
"Gummo" opens with shaky home video footage of a
tornado that hit Xenia in 1974, which I suppose is
intended to explain why the town is a spiritual
wasteland -- the tornado must have blown away all
forms of intellect, decency, and humanity.</P>
<P>Throughout the film's seemingly endless duration,
we are introduced to several recurring characters
going about their sad, daily routines. First we
see Bunny Boy (Jacob Sewell), a scrawny,
bare-chested youth who wears pink rabbit ears on
his head (Why? you might ask. Why not?). During
the opening credits we get to watch him pissing
and spitting off a bridge onto the cars below him.
How insightful.</P>
<P>Then we move on to Solomon (Jacob Reynolds) and
Tummler (Nick Sutton), two freakish-looking
teenagers who ride their bikes around the
neighborhood, looking for stray cats to kill and
sell to the local restaurant supplier. Solomon is
a short kid with a head and face that look two
sizes too big for his body. Tummler, who is tall
and lanky with peach-fuzz sideburns, is played by
Nick Sutton, who Korine first saw on an episode of
"Sally Jesse Raphael" about kids who sniff spray
paint.</P>
<P>I think everybody associated with "Gummo" has been
sniffing a lot of spray paint, especially the
self-professed 23-year-old "artist" responsible
for writing and directing it. Of course, Korine is
not content to sit behind the camera (even though
his name appears three time larger than any one
else's during the opening credits), so he appears
in one pathetic scene as a drunken kid making
clumsy, homosexual advances on a black dwarf. The
movie also features several people who are
mentally challenged in some way, including one
girl with Down's Syndrome and another woman who is
rented out by her husband (Max Perlich) as a
prostitute to the neighborhood kids.</P>
<P>The most sickening thing about "Gummo" is not what
transpires on-screen; there have been other movies
far more repugnant than this one (try Pasolini's
"Salo"), and it really isn't good enough to be
morally reprehensible. What makes the film so
nauseating is Korine's pretension that this is
some kind of new art form that he has privileged
us with. You only need to hear him in one
interview to understand how full of himself he
really is.</P>
<P>Just as a sampling, here are his thoughts on film
schools, which incidentally have produced such
real filmmakers as Martin Scorsese, Oliver Stone,
Francis Ford Coppola, and Steven Spielberg: "I
hate that shit. It's eating the soul of cinema.
Filmmaking has become like a process, and it's all
garbage. All these rich kids who were going to be
doctors now want to be filmmakers, but they have
very little life experience and they're just
writing really shitty wit for each other."</P>
<P>According to Korine, "Gummo" represents a "new
kind of film with a new kind of syntax." That
statement is about as ridiculous as the fact that
producer Cary Woods (who actively defends the
film) actually managed to scrape together $1.3
million to get this film made.</P>
<P>For those under the misconception that they're
seeing something original or groundbreaking in
"Gummo," that Korine has somehow recaptured "the
soul of cinema," let me clear a few things up.
Todd Browning learned the value of using human
oddities for cinematic shock value way back in
1932 when he made "Freaks." "Boldly" mixing film
stocks is nothing new. John Schlesinger did that
back in 1969 with "Midnight Cowboy," and Oliver
Stone has been making it his stock and trade for
the last decade. And making fun of poor white
trash has been a staple of television talk shows
and tabloid newspapers for years. Even the
gross-out factor is old. John Waters pioneered
that back in '72 with "Pink Flamingos," and at
least he was smart enough to do it with a sense of
humor.</P>
<PRE>Simply put, there's nothing <I>new</I> here. This
is not an experimental film. It's pointless
garbage.</PRE>
<P>Korine once said about moviegoing, "I want to feel
hatred, disgust, anything but boredom." I assume
that this was the major imperative behind making
"Gummo," which says much about him as a filmmaker.
What it says is this: he is incapable of
alleviating boredom without being disgusting and
repulsive, which points not only to a fundamental
lack of true creative energy, but to a really sick
mind.</P>
<P>I suppose we can all take comfort in the fact
that, even at its minimal budget, "Gummo" still
bombed at the box office and lost money, so maybe
it will be a long time before anyone funds another
one of Korine's so-called films. Let's hope so.</P>
