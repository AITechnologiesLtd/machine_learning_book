<P>First off: I'm young. I'm 16 years old. Road Trip was
made for people my age and people my age will enjoy
it. If you're not a teenager, you probably won't like
this movie. There is a reason too - it wasn't made for
you to like it. Now on to the review. </P>
<P>In my mind, raunchy films such as American Pie, the
recently released Road Trip, and (to some extent) the
"adult" comedy There's Something About Mary will
always be compared with the original gross-out comedy
classic National Lampoon's Animal House. One of the
few movies to literally take my breath away with
laughter, Animal House helped introduce a genre that
would sicken overprotective parents for decades to
come. After enjoying the excessive nudity, cursing,
prankster behavior, and all out college party
atmosphere that the 1978 trendsetter created, it
really was a shame that the 80's failed to aid in
continuing this dumb-fun style of filmmaking, just one
bomb after another. However, in the last three years
with the addition of Road Trip, the lewd comedy era
seems to be relishing a strong rebirth. First in 1998,
the Farrelly Brothers introduced Mary, a post college
tale filled with indecent behavior and penis jokes so
disgusting laughter was the only form of response that
made sense. In 1999, the Weitz Brothers' American Pie
told the story of a pre-college group and there
experiments in the field of sexual intercourse. Once
again, the offensively funny, crude style seemed
heavily borrowed from Animal House. Finally with Road
Trip in 2000, we get a movie much closer in both plot
and obscenity to my favorite comedy of the 20th
century. </P>
<P>Road Trip seems like more of an homage than a rip off
of Animal House. Twenty years ago, it was very
difficult to get away with the smallest amount of
lasciviousness. I like to think of Road Trip as an
updated version of Animal House - this time with the
possibilities explored and utilized to their fullest
potential. At times, Road Trip does exactly what you
think it won't do; something so outrageous and
unexpected that it becomes shockingly hilarious. To
show how Road Trip goes step further than Animal
House: remember when Otter and the gang decades ago,
with all eyes watching them, uncomfortably sat in a
bar knowing they were the only white people in the
room? Well in Road Trip, the four main characters are
the only white guys in a fraternity house that they
crash at, but the scene doesn't end there - the frat
plays a prank on one of the boys by claiming they
found a Klan Mask in his duffel bag…uh oh. Would this
have happened in a movie twenty years ago? Probably
not. </P>
<P>The story of Road Trip has little significance. It
merely serves as an excuse for pointless but humorous
jokes, one after the other. All you really need to
know to understand this movie is that a college
student accidentally sends a tape to his longtime
girlfriend that shows him having sex with another
girl. To prevent a disaster, the boy and three of his
friends must travel by car from their college in
Ithaca, New York to the University of Austin in three
days. A hilarious supplement to the film is a
character named Barry played by the insane Tom Green.
Much like the John Belushi character of Animal House
(except instead of crushing beer cans on his forehead,
puts live mice in his mouth), Barry has no real point
in the movie but to make you laugh at his unique
qualities. Doing gags very similar to the ones on his
self titled television show, fans should get a kick
out of him, while others may be a little confused at
his odd approach towards comedy.  Unfortunately, at
times, he interferes with the central characters and
slows the film down a bit, but mostly he is a positive
contributor. </P>
<P>Other members of the cast are excellent as lively
caricatures of your stereotypical college student
(loves to smoke weed, party, and have sex, hates to
study). Seann William Scott is great as one of the
travelers. Almost identical to his character in
American Pie and to Tim Matheson's Otter in Animal
House, he is such a jerk that he eventually becomes
fun to watch. It's hard not to watch him steal a bus
from a blind lady and wonder what kind of childhood he
must have had. DJ Qualls is also great as another one
of the travelers. He's puny, gets pushed around by
everyone, and is only on this trip because the others
need his car. He's like Jason Biggs except much more
ignorant and helpless. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, the ending of Road Trip is very
disappointing. A weak, empty finish climaxes all of
the crazy adventures that lead up to it. Predictable
and boring, it certainly can not stand up against the
parade ending in Animal House. </P>
<P>Otherwise, you'll have a fun time viewing Road Trip.
Let your brain take a time out for once, you won't
need it to understand what is going on during the
movie and you won't need it to think about the movie's
message afterwards. This is the kind of movie, where
you don't know what will happen, you laugh really hard
with everyone else in the theater, and then you talk
about it with your friends the next day. That's it.
Enjoy it - then move on with your life until the next
one comes out in 2001.           </P>
