<P>On Friday the 13th my computer's display crashed terminally. On Friday the
20th, the computer was still disabled - so when, that day, I saw Enemy of
the State, the contrast between my electronic reality and the film's
flawless, dazzling magic made the movie both a techno-wonder and a
techno-thriller.</P>
<P>Congressman Jason Robards intends to vote against a Telecommunications
Security and Privacy Act.  Reynolds (John Voight), who is high up in the
NSA (National Security Agency), unable to change the Congressman's mind,
takes the easy way out. He has the man killed in a park, before his
(Voight's) eyes.</P>
<P>By one of those coincidences that transform films into movies, the murder
is recorded by a video camera hidden in the area by photographer Zavitz
(Jason Lee) who was monitoring geese. When he examines the footage and
alerts a magazine editor, his phone call is intercepted. The NSA apparently
bugs and monitors every human on this planet.</P>
<P>Immediately a chase begins, and not a wild goose one. Reynolds army of
computer-whizzes see and hear everything. Armed agents pursue the
photographer. As he   flees, by an amazing coincidence he runs into his
long time-no-see college classmate, labor lawyer Bobby Dean (Will Smith)
who is shopping for lingerie in a shop a la Victoria's Secret with
provocative Class 3 seductresses as saleswomen.</P>
<P>It's a blitz-meeting. The first thing Bobby does is -- improbably-- to give
his visiting card to Zavitz, who, in turn, secretly slips into Bobby's
purchases a diskette he has made of the incriminating video.</P>
<P>Zavitz dies. The God-like computers clue in the pursuers as to the
diskette. Bobby becomes their prey. It's like the familiar Alfred Hithcock
trick of The Wrong Man, except that unsuspecting Bobby does not realize
that he is the Right Man. Get my drift?</P>
<P>The lawyer is spied upon and hunted down. Bugs are planted on his clothes,
his shoes, a transmitter that duplicates his Mont Blanc pen, another that
duplicates his watch, etc. NSA's stock most likely includes bugs in Viagra
pills, toilet paper rolls, wedding rings, toenail clippers and all else.</P>
<P>Instant images and sounds show up on banks of monitors that also are hooked
up to cars, taxis, trucks, helicopters and a dedicated satellite 155 miles
up. Such astounding technology makes you a) suspend your disbelief;  b)
suspend it some more; c) wonder why Saddam Hussein has not yet been
terminated.</P>
<P>Actor Will Smith has declared: "You can be followed, watched, listened to
wherever you go; there's nothing the Government can't do. And the
technology we use in the movie is actually 10 years old. Fot this film, we
went to the CIA. We saw a recorder that you can implant in one of your
tooth fillings. We saw satellite surveillance of poppy fields. All the
technology that we show in the film exists for real. The concept of privacy
is obsolete."</P>
<P>Who am I not to believe him? I'll have to be cautious though next week,
when I see Nick, my dentist. But then, if there's nothing the government
can't do, why can't it govern?</P>
<P>Anyway, the NSA people or their equivalent either  must be furious or are
laughing themselves sick. Can't guess.</P>
<P>If the computer screens are crystal clear, the plot is not. At the end
Voight is revealed as a rogue super-spy, yet I can't decide whether his
henchpeople are co-conspirators or believe that they are kosher patriots.</P>
<P>Early on, during a sequence of long-distance miking  it became obvious that
the whole thing was derivative of Coppola's masterful The Conversation, but
done here in silly ways bereft of humanity, filmed like an MTV montage and
not involving the audience. So, who, later, pops up but Gene Hackman, the
tortured anti-hero of The Conversation!</P>
<P>He turns the movie's techno-jokes into one big inside joke.
Hackman, a techno-genius and former NSAer,  teams  up with Will for
defense, counter-attack -- and a happy ending.</P>
<P>I have revealed almost nothing of the gimmickry and the twists. These are
as numeorus as the bytes of your computer. At random, they include and
involve quid pro quos; vengeful Mafiosi; the luscious Lisa Bonet as Will's
college swetheart and now his informer; Will's wife, son and lapdog; Will
as a human fly; Will without pants; Will puzzling (and amusing) an Oriental
couple in their hotel room; a hotel fire; explosions; a mysterious can
driver; a sort of humongous "French Connection"-ish (which starred Hackman)
chase in a tunnel  and beneath it; split-second changes; and so on ad
infinitum and ad absurdum.</P>
<P>"Non-stop" takes on a new meaning. So do "techno-over-skill  and overkill."
Nonsense goes from mega to giga. Whatever truths are present, they are
treated so lavishly that they make King Kong, Mothra, Spielberg's dinosaurs
and James Bond feel real; by comparison the Enigma encryption machine of
World War II and the amazing spy-gadgets and surveillance of STASI (the
East German all-pervasive secret police) feel like advanced toys.</P>
<P>The realities behind Enemy of the State -- and I don't doubt that there are
several --go so much overboard that the movie becomes a fantasy whose
cautionary aspects are defanged.</P>
<P>As in the James Bond hyperboles, the silliness has a lining of humor which,
along with the exaggerations, does help pass the time. Will Smith is very
good. He performs with self-confidence, a twinkle in his eye, and no
mugging for the lens. His type of humor and cool reminds me of Eddie
Murphy's, minus the grin; or, going way back, of Clark Gable's, minus the
smugness.</P>
