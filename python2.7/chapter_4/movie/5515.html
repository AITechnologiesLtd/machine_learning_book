<PRE>                                     BATMAN
                       A film review by David N. Butterworth
            Copyright 1996 David N. Butterworth/The Summer Pennsylvanian</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Tim Burton
Rating: *** (Maltin scale)</PRE>
<P>For those of you who were smitten by Pennsylvania Lottery fever earlier
last month and avowed never to stand in line again, you might want to think
twice.</P>
<PRE>BATMAN has arrived.</PRE>
<P>Hot on the heels of all the hype and the hoopla and the hullabaloo, the
movie itself finally makes an appearance, overshadowed, in part, by the
furious fervor that preceded it, a marketing blitz the likes of which
Hollywood has rarely seen.</P>
<P>But put away the bat memorabilia for a moment and ask yourself the one
question which surely must be on everybody's lips: was it worth the wait?</P>
<PRE>Actually, yes.</PRE>
<P>One cannot begin to talk about BATMAN--the phenomenon--and not use
superlatives.  It's certainly the biggest, boldest, most-publicized, most
eagerly awaited film of the summer.  BATMAN--the movie--doesn't quite live
up to its own high standards or expectations--how could it?--but you won't
leave the theater feeling cheated or ripped off.  BATMAN delivers all
right, every high-tech, high-brow minute of it.</P>
<P>For those of you who have been in a coma for the last six months, BATMAN is
the latest depiction of the two-dimensional character created by comic book
artist Bob Kane.  It's the story about the
millionaire-by-day/daring-do-gooder-by-night who rids Gotham City of its
criminally undesirable.</P>
<P>Although the film is thoroughly entertaining, it does contain some serious
production flaws.  Fortunately, these are offset by a refreshingly original
look which helps keep the film on track.</P>
<P>For instance, Michael Keaton's woeful miscasting as Batman proves to be a
major liability.  Bruce Wayne is portrayed as a sensitive introvert, an
interesting digression from the campy, tights-clad Adam West of the 1960s
television serial.  But Keaton walks through the movie with a puzzled look
on his face as if he's misplaced the keys to the batmobile.  His scenes
with photographer-turned-love-interest Vicki Vale (played by Kim Basinger)
are awkward and unconvincing and his cherubic looks invariably do him in.</P>
<P>But once Keaton puts on that batsuit - well, it could be Pee Wee Herman
under that cowl for all we care.  It's a transformation; Keaton IS Batman
... though does anyone ever remember Batman, the character, referring to
himself as such?</P>
<P>Another limitation is the fact that there is virtually no plot to speak of.
In some movies this would be a drawback but in BATMAN it seems to matter
little that the storyline is relegated to second place.  Overwhelming it is
Anton Furst's impressive production design, which borrows intelligently
from the likes of Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS and H.R. Geiger's metallic
constructions for ALIEN.  Gotham City has never looked more architecturally
imposing.</P>
<P>And we don't learn much more about the man behind the mask.  Who dug the
bat cave?  Where did Bruce get all his money?  Who actually makes the bat
gadgets?  He's already up and running when the film opens, so we never
learn how he got started in the crime-fighting business, though we are told
why (his parents were callously gunned down by a pair of aspiring hoodlums
on Gotham's violent streets).  Since the film is reputed to be closer to
the original comic book character, the writers should have dug a little
deeper and unearthed some of this dirt.</P>
<P>Last but not least, supporting characters are wasted.  Jack Palance (as
Carl Grissom) is severely under utilized, and you often wonder why he, or
Billy Dee Williams, who plays political candidate Harvey Dent, was ever in
the picture to begin with.  On a related note, has anyone else noticed that
the mayor of Gotham City bears more than a passing resemblance to Ed Koch?
What, does this film have a biting,  satirical edge to it too?</P>
<P>But the film's trump card is Jack Nicholson.  If you thought Nicholson's
part as the Devil in THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK was the ultimate showcase for
his talents, wait until you get a load of him here.  As the Joker, the role
he was born to play, Nicholson is at his roguish, flambuoyant best--and
absolutely astonishing!</P>
<P>No other actor could have pulled off this role without leaning towards
self-parody.  But Nicholson plays the villainous reincarnation of Jack
Napier straight down the middle and, as a result, flabbergasts the audience
with his rendition of the maniacally wide-eyed, white-faced jester.  The
climactic face off between the Joker and Batman requires the viewer to
suspend considerable belief--and by that time you'll be rooting for
Keaton's caped crusader--but it's Nicholson's movie every step of the way.</P>
<P>BATMAN will no doubt become not only the summer's top grossing movie, but
quite possibly the most profitable film ever made.  If you do go to see the
film, and chances are you will, go see it for Nicholson.  Director Tim
Burton pulled off the casting coup of the decade when he signed Nicholson
to play the Joker, a role for which Nicholson was reportedly paid $11
million.  No wonder he's smiling throughout!</P>
