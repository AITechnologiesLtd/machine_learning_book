<PRE>8 MM
Reviewed by Vince Yim
At theatres everywhere</PRE>
<P>Someone please tell me why David Fincher didn't direct this one.</P>
<P>8 MM stars Nicolas Cage as a Tom Watts, a private investigator who is
called in after an elderly woman discovers her late husband owned an 8mm
film depicting a teenage girl being raped and murdered. While such
footage can easily be staged, Watts' task is twofold: to find out if the
footage is real, and to find out who is responsible if the footage is
real. To do this, Watts must delve into the world of underground porn
where moving images of any deviant sexual act can be obtained for the
right price. While Watts' task is difficult, maintaining his grip on his
morals and sanity will be even harder.</P>
<P>The film has a lot of promise, mostly due to the clout achieved by the
screenwriter, Andrew Kevin Walker, who is best known for his
collaboration with director David Fincher for the dark and disturbing
Se7en. Both films feature the protagonist facing off against really sick
and twisted individuals, being completely morally annihilated at each of
the films' conclusions. As well, 8 MM features Nicolas Cage, a very
capable actor.</P>
<P>However, with director Joel Schumacher at the helm, anything can happen.
While many are still stinging from the atrocity known as Batman and
Robin, Schumacher has proven himself to be a capable film director, with
such inventive films as The Lost Boys and Falling Down.  But after
watching this film, the opening question remains: why wasn't David
Fincher selected to direct this film?</P>
<P>Fincher's harrowing style was especially suited to the dark and
disturbing nature of Walker's screenplay in Se7en. The end result was a
powerful psychological thriller that had an extremely unsettling effect
on the audience. Unfortunately, one would be hard pressed to find that
in 8 MM.</P>
<P>While the dark atmosphere of 8 MM is firmly established, the film is
ultimately a haphazardly paced, with a lot of storyline elements that
are practically tacked on. The serial killer depicted in the film comes
off as very unthreatening when revealed at the end, the characters leave
the audience emotionally detached, and some of the dialogue makes for
many unintentionally humorous moments. At least one Hollywood insider
report states that Walker was displeased with the direction of the film
and wished for his name to be taken off the credits. Unfortunately for
him, that never happened.</P>
<P>Admittedly, the film does have its moments. Joaquin Phoenix shines as
Max, an adult bookstore employee and Watts' guide into the underground
world of pornography. The film also has a few intentionally humorous
moments and a few cringe-inducing scenes reminiscent of Se7en.
Unfortunately, as a whole, they aren't enough to save the film.</P>
<P>I wanted to enjoy this movie. I really did. Unfortunately, the film
fails to match up with the high standards left with Walker's screenplay
in Se7en. While 8 MM isn't completely unwatchable, the film isn't
memorable either. Save your money and wait for the video.</P>
<P>Rating: 5/10
