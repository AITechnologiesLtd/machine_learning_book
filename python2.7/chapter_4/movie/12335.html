<PRE>Review by:         Joy Wyse</PRE>
<P>Reflecting on the movie BLACK DOG I see holes that you could drive a truck
through, but that's exactly what they did.  They drove that truck anywhere
they could.  The more explosions and wrecks that there are, the better.</P>
<P>Swayze portrays a husband/father who has recently been paroled from prison
where he was serving a sentence for vehicular manslaughter.  His deadly
accident had occurred when he fell asleep at the wheel [and saw the black
dog!] and had killed a couple of people.  </P>
<P>Now, he no longer has a license to drive but he works for a trucking
company.  Of course, the owner offers him $10,000 to drive a "special"
load from   Georgia to New Jersey.  Being the good parolee that he is, he
refuses, until he learns that his wife had been unable to keep up with the
bills and their home is being foreclosed  unless they come up with $9,000
immediately.</P>
<P>>From there the plot gets very involved with hijackers, FBI, ATF, and who
knows who else trying to intercept the load.  Swayze has been established
in the film as a skilled truck driver, so he pulls off some very fancy
driving.</P>
<P>In the back of the rig there is a vicious black dog who is there to
protect the load.  It seems that the only reason that dog is really there
is to add to the title.  There is no explanation for the dog's actions. 
Although the dog is portrayed as being anxious to pounce whenever the rear
door is opened, he is mysteriously hesitant when the officer at the weigh
station inspects the truck.  Everyone in the audience was wondering if the
truckers had gone off and left the dog behind somewhere.   When he finally
snarls, it seems almost comical.  It would have been far better if the dog
had lurked in the background whenever the truck was entered.  We could
have been surprised when Patrick first encounters him, and then we would
have been anticipating the dog's appearance when the guard inspects the
load.    Also, later in the film, when a dead body is placed in the rear
with the load, what does that dog do?</P>
<P>As I mentioned, there are plenty of good stunts and crashes and
explosions.  How do you wreck a lot of cars at once?  Just crash a truck
that is carrying a load of cars.</P>
<P>Swayze is OK in the roll, not good, not bad.  Kevin Sorbo was originally
intended as the star but his shoulder problem  prevented it.  I wonder if
it would have been different with him.  As for the two singers, Randy
Travis and Meatloaf, they both turn in creditable portrayals, although it
is funny listening to Travis trying to sing poorly.  Make sure that you
listen to the lyrics of his creations.  They're very funny.  I especially
like "He drew first, but I shot faster."</P>
<P>I won't mind watching it again on late night TV when there's nothing
better on, but I'm not going to pay to see it again.</P>
<PRE>It gets a C.</PRE>
<PRE>SEE YOU AT THE MOVIES!</PRE>
