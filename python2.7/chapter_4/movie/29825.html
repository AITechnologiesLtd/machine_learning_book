<PRE>IN PRAISE OF LOVE
A film review by Rachel Gordon
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>One might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new
Jean-Luc Godard film.  After all, he was a founding member of the highly
influential French New Wave.  He is also an esteemed film critic,
lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his
writing.  However, his latest creation, In Praise of Love, is possibly
the most exasperating film experience of the year.</P>
<P>The abstract concept on which the film is based had merit, to dissect
love into the following four categories: meeting, physical passion,
quarrels, and reconciliation.  These four universal truths would be
revealed through three different couples: young, adult, and elderly.  It
is Edgar's (Bruno Putzulu) self-appointed task to capture these moments
after a recent breakup, to define a central idea: "It's only when things
are over that they make sense."  Whether this project will end up a
play, film, or opera remains undecided.  The thesis is simple enough
that, if played right, it could really hold sympathetic value for
anyone.</P>
<P>Instead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes, the
next scene no more engaging than the last.  Only once does any character
utter something worthwhile, but by the time it happens you're so
thoroughly bored you can easily miss it.  But don't fret, it will
surface again.  You could easily sleep through whole sections of the
film (as some fellow critics did) and wake up in a scene exactly like
the one you nodded off in, not having missed anything worthwhile.</P>
<P>But you hold hope for some time.  The background music keeps you in a
state of urgency, and even suspense, for the first few conversations. 
It's only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose
all hope.  And with speeches like, "I am thinking of something, but I
can only think of that something when I am thinking of something else,"
how can you expect to hold anyone's interest?</P>
<P>To Godard's credit, he certainly knows how to frame a scene.  The black
and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly
beautiful.  Watching Edgar read while walking along a train track on a
mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him.  And
if this film had anything poignant to say, you would have, which makes
you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities.  The
environments, be it city or country, are impeccably captured in crisp
detail, but the script never complements them.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by
randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene. 
Sometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings, but these are even
more cryptic than the spoken words.  The second half is composed of
nauseating hyper-color that often blurs the image.  You suddenly feel
like a doomed character straight out of Scanners.</P>
<P>The only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the
United States bastardizing history in the making of movies.  Steven
Spielberg is picked on in particular.  While I'll grant that this does
happen, and I tend to shy away from watching such garbage, it's still a
pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific
qualities of couplehood.</P>
<P>It just goes to show, an intelligent person isn't necessarily an
admirable storyteller.  The days of Breathless are no more.</P>
