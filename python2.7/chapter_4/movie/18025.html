<PRE>_eXistenZ_ (R) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>For all its awe-inspiring gee-wizardry, the common perception of virtual
reality remains as that of a rather cold, technical concept.  As seen in
reality and as depicted in the movies, VR enables one to do things one
would never otherwise be able to, but it pretty much boils down to doing
next to nothing: just lying still, with cumbersome gear strapped onto the
eyes and different places on the body.</P>
<P>Leave it to writer-director David Cronenberg to turn conventional
perception on its ear.  His latest film, _eXistenZ_, is indeed part of
the recent crop of VR-themed thrillers, but Cronenberg's take on the
concept is truly unlike anything ever seen.  _eXistenZ_ takes its name
from a virtual reality system created by Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason
Leigh), a world-famous game designer.  The virtual world explored in
eXistenZ--and, in turn, _eXistenZ_--is nothing particularly new or
visually spectacular: more or less, it's a duplication of the actual
world, except with seamless, if abrupt, shifts in time and place. 
Neither is Cronenberg's plot terribly ambitious.  Fundamentally, the
story simply has Allegra and her makeshift bodyguard Ted Pikul (Jude Law,
sporting a flawless Canadian accent) on the run from assassins who want
to see "the demoness Allegra" dead.  Eventually, the two retreat into
eXistenZ, a world that may actually be more "real" than the one they live
in.</P>
<P>Cronenberg's main concern, however, is not so much in the intentionally
video-game-thin story, but in the finer details, most notably in the
nature of the eXistenZ system itself.  There is no heavy headgear,
gloves, wires, or the like; in their place is a soft, kidney-shaped
GamePod, connected to an UmbyCord, which is exactly as it sounds: long,
thick, and fleshy.  It would be tempting to call the eXistenZ system
"biomechanical," but there's nothing "mechanical" or electronic about it;
the GamePod appears to be a natural living organism in itself, undulating
and gurgling as if it had a mind of its own.  Further blurring the line
between nature and technology is the GamePod's power source: the human
nervous system.  The UmbyCord is plugged into a BioPort, which is a hole
drilled into a player's lower back, tapping directly into the spinal
column.</P>
<P>Making the human body part of the equipment not only adds a certain
creepiness, but also a dimension of perverse eroticism.  Before being
inserted, both the tip of the UmbyCord and the BioPort must be moistened,
and when the BioPort is penetrated by the UmbyCord--or anything else, for
that matter--it gets visibly stimulated.  Mere connection does not mean
entrance into eXistenZ; one must also stroke the moist, nipple-like knobs
on the GamePod.  This sensual caressing of the GamePod goes on as one is
in the game.</P>
<P>The blatantly sexual overtones are just one bizarre detail of
Cronenberg's fascinating, if unsettling, vision.  There is a great deal
of gore in _eXistenZ_, most of all in Allegra and Ted's game, where
mutant amphibians figure prominently--or, rather, their remains.  Their
dead bodies are gruesomely mined for their innards, which are used to
build GamePods in a slaughterhouse called a Trout Farm; they also turn up
on the unappetizing menu of a Chinese restaurant.  The slimy stickiness
could easily be pegged as cheap sensationalism, but it plays an integral
and sometimes surprising part in Cronenberg's larger picture.</P>
<P>Playing a weaker part in that larger picture is the story, which, while
superficially engaging, never adds up to much.  I won't give away its
conclusion, which was met with some boos at my audience, but it
essentially reveals _eXistenZ_ as one big tease--which, I believe, is the
point.  What matters to Cronenberg is the imaginative trip on which his
film takes its audience and the eerie feeling of unease it leaves with
them at the end.  In that sense, _eXistenZ_, like its namesake, is one
big game, but it is definitely one worth playing--or, rather, one to be
played _by_.</P>
