<P>Plot: A group of Disney artists go on a tour of Latin America in search 
of inspiration. The results:- Donald Duck takes a comic tour of Lake 
Titicaca and the Chilean mountains; when his father falls ill the young 
mailplane Pedro must make a perilous mail pickup across the treacherous 
Andean range but runs afoul of storms created by a famous bad-tempered 
mountain; the cowboy Goofy is transported from Texas and transformed 
into a gaucho in the Argentinean pampas regions; the parrot Jose Carroca 
takes Donald Duck on a singing-dancing tour of Rio de Janeiro.</P>
<P>`Saludos Amigos' was made by Disney during The War. It was a time when 
conscription had gutted the pool of available Disney artists. Disney 
dealt with this by downsizing from feature length animation to 
portmanteau-styled animation anthologies - with the likes of `Melody 
Time', `Make Mine Music', `Song of the South', `Fun & Fancy Free', `The 
Adventures of Ichabod and Mr Toad' and `The Three Caballeros'. And, 
although none of the anthologies were really bad, this diversion into 
these compilation anthologies was a considerable comedown from the 
heights Disney had climbed at the beginning of the 1940s with the likes 
of `Dumbo', `Pinocchio' and `Bambi' and for several years the studios 
grace fell in the public eye. It took until the 1950s for Disney to 
return to feature-length animation but even then many of the features 
somehow felt lesser films and there was the sense that some Golden Age 
of Disney animation that had passed away never to be regained.</P>
<P>`Saludos Amigos' has one of the most unique concepts ever tried in 
animation - that of the animated travelogue. At the time it was made the 
Latin American market held one of the largest fan audiences of 
characters like Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse. And along with `The Three 
Caballeros', it shows Disney trying to tap directly into this market - 
in some segments here even the background lettering comes in Spanish 
which suggests that Disney was thinking of the Hispanic market even 
ahead of the English-speaking one.</P>
<P>The whole exercise has clearly been conducted as an experiment and as 
such it is somewhat hit and miss. As the travelogue it sets out to be, 
it is rather cursory, only visiting four Latin American locations - Lake 
Titicaca, The Andes, Argentina and Rio - and leaving the rest of the 
region untouched. And for a feature it is surprisingly short - only 
forty minutes in length - it could easily have supported at least two or 
three more segments.</P>
<P>The first, third and fourth segments keep fairly much to the travelogue 
format but the second seems really more of an original short. The first 
and third segments are the most consistent in tone, using familiar 
Disney characters in lively slapstick scenarios to demonstrate the 
features and culture of the various regions. The `Portrait of Brasil' 
segment, sort of an impressionistic samba number, is the slightest. 
However the second segment is a pure delight where the Disney animators' 
penchant for dewey-eyed anthropomorphism in the characterization of the 
baby plane is utterly gorgeous - it struggling through storms with a 
mail bag tucked under its wing, coughing and spluttering as it runs out 
of fuel, going to school to learn `reading and sky-writing' and the 
like. This is one segment that one wishes had been longer.</P>
