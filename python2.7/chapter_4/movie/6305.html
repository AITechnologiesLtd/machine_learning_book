<PRE>Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.</PRE>
<P>      I should note before anything else that RANSOM is not a spectacular,
classic piece of film-making, but simply a very well-crafted
action/suspense thriller.  It is only because so many of its genre
contemporaries have been so lackluster that RANSOM begins to look like a
jewel, because RANSOM is a textbook example of the little things which so
many bad to mediocre suspense thrillers could do to become better by
orders of magnitude.  In fact, the conventional wisdom in Hollywood --
borne out by the success of TWISTER, THE ROCK and INDEPENDENCE DAY as
recent examples -- is that suspense is actually counter-productive because
the establishment of suspense takes time, valuable minutes which will not
involve a 10 megaton explosion or a flying computer-generated cow.  RANSOM
is consistently tense because it is patient, patient enough to set up
characters and situations in a way which really pays off.</P>
<P>     Mel Gibson stars as Tom Mullen, a multimillionaire airline magnate
living a charmed life in a New York penthouse with wife Kate (Rene Russo)
and son Sean (Brawley Nolte).  That life is shattered one day when Sean
disappears, abducted by a group of kidnapers who demand $2 million for
his release.  Tom tries to play by the kidnapers' rules, but when the FBI
team headed by Agent Lonnie Hawkins (Delroy Lindo) makes a botched attempt
at a rescue operation, Tom concludes that they have no intention of
letting Sean go alive.  Desperate to even the odds, Tom takes drastic and
risky action to put the kidnapers on the defensive, the result of which
can only be either complete victory or the worst kind of defeat.</P>
<P>     RANSOM begins with the radical premise that its characters actually
matter, and uses that premise to build a story which matters from moment
to moment.  Mullen is far from a shining knight as our protagonist, but
rather a hard-nosed and occasionally unscrupulous businessman whose
rebellious stand against the kidnapers is perhaps as much a result of
guilt as logic.  The kidnapers themselves (Lili Taylor, Liev Schreiber and
Donnie Wahlberg among them) have distinct personalities, and the clashes
between those personalities show the cracks in their united front early
on; Gary Sinise, as Jimmy Shaker, the mastermind of the operation, is so
deeply embittered by his impression that the wealthy get away with murder
that he probably believes his actions are thoroughly justified.  These are
not spectacularly complex characters -- Rene Russo's Kate is actually
something of a disappointment as the wife who does little but sob -- but
they are real people, and they are directed by Ron Howard in scenes which
allow you inside their heads at critical, decisive moments.</P>
<P>     Howard also has the ability to take moments which in other hands
might have been quickly dispatched plot points and make them compelling.
The story would have progressed without the lengthy sequence in which Tom
and Kate realize that Sean is missing, but the tension and mounting dread
in Howard's direction are palpable.  Similarly, we could have gotten from
point A to point B without showing Jimmy's reaction to Tom's gambit, but
the growing realization that his plan is falling apart is spelled out on
his face.  Even minor details like the first notification from the
kidnapers -- a jittery video file sent to the Mullens via email -- is
given a spark which elicits a gasp from the audience.</P>
<P>     RANSOM does have its obligatory moments of action and violence, but
Howard refuses to treat those sequences as the purpose for his movie.
There is a driving tension and a natural rhythm to the structure of RANSOM
which doesn't make it feel like the director and screenwriters are trying
to exhaust you with set pieces.  Although there are flashy moments in
RANSOM, notably a telephone confrontation between Jimmy and Tom which is
edited to whiplash perfection, it is notable in its lack of devotion to
flash; it is that rare action thriller where you anticipate the moment the
characters _start_ talking instead of the moment they _stop_.  Gibson and
Sinise are both in fine form, and their battle of wills moves RANSOM like
a living motor.  RANSOM may cop out on giving us a climax which addresses
the more unsavory aspects of Tom's character, but it deserves recognition
as an example of professionalism in film-making, of what is possible when
someone seems to give a damn.  Too many thrillers swing for the fences
every time up, and end up striking out most of the time.  RANSOM is more
like a fundamentally sound contact hitter, banging out single after single
along with the occasional well-placed extra-base hit.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 ransom notes:  8.</PRE>
