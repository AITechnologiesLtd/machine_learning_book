<PRE>CITIZEN KANE (1941)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Writer/Director: Orson Welles
Starring: Orson Welles, Dorothy Comingore, Joseph Cotten, Everett
Sloane, Ruth Warrick, Ray Collins</P>
<P>"Citizen Kane" is always being referred to as the greatest film of all
time, or at least in the top five.  Every critic loves it (it's Roger
Ebert's favorite film of all time), and we constantly hear how perfect
it is.  I'm not going to deny any of this.  I mean, if you've seen it,
you know how awesome it is.  It's 1997, yet I was still blown away by a
film that was called "innovative" back in 1941.  I've always said that
the greatness of a film is truly measured over time, and this is one of
the few films that is truly amazing to watch, and actually lives up to
all that damn hype.</P>
<P>So what's the big deal with "Citizen Kane?"  Well, for starters, it's
technically innovative, much in the way "Star Wars" was (I'm not saying
Kane like blows up a death star or something like that).  Orson Welles,
who made this when he was 26 (!!!), used all kinds of new techniques for
his film, including depth of field, wide angle lenses, etc, etc, etc. 
There are cool-ass shots all over the place, including some great
swooping shots, wonderful shadows on the perfect things, and even a
brilliant shot of a nurse walking into a room shot through a broken
piece of reflecting glass.  Even in these digital 90s, that looks cool.</P>
<P>But "Kane" isn't just innovative technical-wise; it's innovative
story-telling-wise, becoming the pre-cursor for non-linear narratives
like that of "Pulp Fiction," "The Usual Suspects," etc.  In pieceing
together the story of the mysterious protagonist, we see flashbacks told
in whatever order, making it fun to piece together.  Sure, there's an
on-going narrative - the search for who was Charles Foster Kane - but we
get to see parts of his life told by people who knew him, which was
revolutionary back then, since most people went to the movies for
straight-foward narratives, like "King Kong."  No wonder this movie
bombed financially back then.</P>
<P>So what's the story of this flick?  It deals with, well, as I said, the
search for who was Charles Foster Kane (Orson himself).  Kane actually
dies in the beginning of the film, but before he does, he utters the
famous last word, "Rosebud."  We then cut to a newsreel documentary on
him being viewed by some newsmen.  In it, we get the rough outline of
the film, telling us he had inherited a huge fortune at a young age, and
became a big-time newsman.  He was also hated and loved at the same
time, and even ran for governor.  But of course, this is an empty
experience, since no one can really explain why he was, and the makers
of the film think that it's "Rosebud."  But what is "Rosebud?"</P>
<P>The film takes us through flashbacks, as they interview all sorts of
people who were big parts of his life.  We see almost his whole life,
presented in these flashbacks, and in montages.  Kane was a very
lonesome man who, as people say, wanted to be loved, but had problems
with other people.  He has two unsucessful marriages during his life,
suffers some scandals, and dies alone and miserable in his giant palace
he built to himself, Xanadu (no relation to the early 80s Olivia Newton
John film of the same name).</P>
<P>The ending is ironic and totally brilliant, and brings the film to a
beautiful poetic ending.  But this film is not just a good ending; the
entire film is amazing to watch.  Orson Welles expertly breaks the
protagonist down through the flashbacks told from other people's
perspectives, showing that no one truly understands anyone else.  Of
course, we get an omnipotent view of the man, and learn what made him
tick in the final frame.</P>
<P>The acting is excellent from everyone (although Dorothy Comingore as his
second wife is kind of annoying, but that kind of helps her performance
a bit), but, obviously, the best part of this film is Orson.  His
direction is damn-near flawless, his writing is awesome and not corny
for a sec, and his acting is superb.  Not even half the size he would be
by the time he was in "The Muppet Movie," Welles is still a striking
presence in the film, perfectly embodying his subject.  He has a kind of
coldness which distances himself from everyone, but somehow embraces the
viewer to caring about him, even when he's being a total ass to people. 
And his make-up for when he's older is flawless; he fools everyone, and
doesn't nearly resemble his 26 year old self.</P>
<P>Oh, and special mention should be made to the composer of the musical
score - Bernard Herrman.  He creates a beautifully haunting score which
is nothing short of brilliant.  Of course, it's penned by Herrman, so
what do you expect?</P>
<P>Contrary to ignorant opinion, "Citizen Kane" is neither pretentious nor
boring.  It moves at a wonderful pace, with things always occuring in
the story.  And the symbolism is simple yet sweet, and is never overdone
in any way.  If there is a film that is pretty close to being brilliant,
it would be "Citizen Kane," and I'm not just saying that so I won't be
scrutinized by other film geeks.  It's an awesome film which hasn't
dated a bit, and a film which embodies a perfect combination of
technical artistry, as well as narrative brilliance.</P>
