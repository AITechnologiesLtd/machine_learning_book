<PRE>The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 78</PRE>
<P>"The Purple Rose of Cairo" is an imaginative and clever
comedy, directed by Woody Allen and starring Mia Farrow
and Jeff Daniels, who both give strong performances.</P>
<P>The film is set in a small town during the depression
of the 1930s.  Farrow plays a klutzy waitress and abused
spouse whose only escape from dreadful reality is
the local movie theatre.  While watching a particular
film for the fifth time, one of the characters
(Daniels) steps out into the theatre from the movie
screen to romance her.</P>
<P>This is the first of many surprising, original,
and humorous plot twists, all of which work very well.
Daniels-the-character is a naive, good-natured
person with little knowledge of the real world,
and the resulting misunderstandings (he can't spend
his play money, he is clueless about prostitutes)
are very funny.</P>
<P>Soon, Daniels-the-actor comes to town from Hollywood
to confront Daniels-the-character, while Farrow
must choose between the two Daniels and her
good-for-nothing husband (Danny Aiello).  Allen
remains behind the camera.</P>
<P>Allen, while making us laugh, has a couple points
he is getting across.  He lampoons Hollywood hypocrisy,
which is present in the 1930s as in any era.  The
various actors come across as petty, manipulative
and self-involved.  The film also has a negative
depiction of men.  Of all the major and minor male
characters, only Daniels-the-character, who isn't real,
is a swell guy.  Other characters, including the
husband, Daniels-the-actor, and the restaurant owner,
do not come off well.</P>
<P>"The Purple Rose of Cairo" won the Golden Globe award
for Best Screenplay (by Allen), and was given an Oscar
nomination in that category.</P>
