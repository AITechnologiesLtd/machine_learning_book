<PRE>A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>What Lies Beneath tries to be two different movies. At times it is a taut 
adult thriller with plenty of jolts, sure to make many people jump in their 
seats. Other moments are standard horror flick material filled with fake 
shocks and predictable conclusions. When the movie starts getting easy to 
foresee, it is still thrilling. This is the type of movie where one event 
impacts the next one. Seemingly trivial lines and occurrences influence most 
of the characters' actions. Only the attentive viewer will get rewarded. The 
prizes here are many, and worth waiting for.</P>
<P>Claire (Michelle Pfeiffer) lives in a beautiful New England home with her 
husband Norman (Harrison Ford). Their only daughter just went away to 
college, so they are enjoying some peace, quiet, and more time with each 
other. One day when Claire is working in her garden, she hears her new next 
door neighbor in hysterics. Becoming increasingly paranoid, Claire begins 
spying on the couple and their home. The husband is more than a little 
frightening, and Claire thinks she saw him put his wifeâ^À^Ùs body in the back of 
a car trunk. Shortly after, Claire receives her first visit from the spirit. 
Someone or something not of this world is trying to contact her. Getting 
increasingly distant from her husband, she begins searching for an answer to 
the ghost and what he or she wants. Piece by piece, the clues come together 
to form a horrifying conclusion.</P>
<P>To those who have not seen this movie, it sounds very similar to M. Night 
Shyamalanâ^À^Ùs The Sixth Sense. It is not. What Lies Beneath has more 
similarities with Stir of Echoes, the Kevin Bacon thriller released last 
September. The plotline is strikingly similar, and both movies clean up and 
answer all questions quite nicely. In addition, there is the obvious Rear 
Window element that works for the film. The unneeded fake frights, like a 
scratching noise that reveals itself to be only a dog, and people that bump 
into each other in badly lit rooms, come straight from Halloween: H20. These 
hurt the film somewhat.</P>
<P>There is a suspenseful music overkill. The score tries to be haunting, but 
works only when accentuating the thrills onscreen. Whenever the audience 
should shriek, a loud twang almost instructs them to do so. I would have 
screamed without the music. There hasnâ^À^Ùt been any movie so far this year 
thatâ^À^Ùs this exciting or scary. 1998â^À^Ùs A Perfect Murder with Michael Douglas 
and Gwyneth Paltrow comes to mind as the last grown-up thriller this good. 
While the film runs a bit long, and frequently confuses being slow with being 
mysterious, itâ^À^Ùs still a good time. Michelle Pfeiffer reminds us why she is a 
star. Her performance is excellent. Harrison Ford is particularly good as 
well, especially since he hasnâ^À^Ùt gotten any good roles lately.</P>
<P>Director Robert Zemeckis has been very secretive about this movie. No one can 
interview him, and he refuses to give away anything about the plot. He has a 
great reason for this. The trailer for this film shows way too much of the 
mystery that unfolds, and really spoils the fun. Anyone who hasnâ^À^Ùt seen the 
trailer should turn off any TV ads or close your eyes and ears during the 
preview at the movies. The experience will be more enjoyable. Zemeckis also 
comes up with some very inventive camera angles. Instead of just focusing on 
a characterâ^À^Ùs face, he looks at their shoulders, stomach, and toes. This 
isnâ^À^Ùt just a thriller either. Some great lines get sandwiched in between the 
screams.</P>
<P>A thriller that really thrills with its comedy and story, but never its 
creativity. Excellent performances make What Lies Beneath above average. This 
is an ideal adult escape during this action film filled summer.</P>
