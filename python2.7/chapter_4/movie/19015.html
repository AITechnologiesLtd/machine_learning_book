Paramount Pictures
starring John Travolta, Madeleine Stowe, James Cromwell, Timothy
Hutton, Clarence Williams III, James Woods, Leslie Stefanson
based on the novel by Nelson DeMille
written by Christopher Bertolini and William Goldman
directed by Simon West</P>
<P>The topic of debate in "The General's Daughter", a conventional
thriller from Simon West, is whether there is a place for women in the
army. The problem, though, is that the ending fails to present a
clear-cut opinion on the matter. And from watching the film, we don't
have anything to base out opinions on either. "The General's Daughter"
stars John Travolta as an undercover detective who, with a special
agent played by Madeleine Stowe, is investigating the rape and murder
of Capt.  Elizabeth Campbell(Leslie Stefanson), daughter of General
Joe Campbell(James Cromwell). What the two end up finding is a slew of
cover-ups involving some "extracurricular activities". The script is
awful, but things remain interesting because of a touchy subject
matter, and also because of a fine performance by James Woods as a
murder suspect. The most I can say is that it's better than Simon
West's last feature, which was the embarrassing "Con Air". John
Travolta needs a more eclectic role and Madeleine Stowe should use her
tenacity to her advantage. "The General's Daughter" is a so-so
thriller without much originality.</P>
