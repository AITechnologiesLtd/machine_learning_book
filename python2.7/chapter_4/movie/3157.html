<PRE>                                  SPEECHLESS
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     This a typical boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl-back,
boy loses girl-again, and on and on, over and over.  The only
difference between SPEECHLESS and the hundreds of others of its genre
(or "ilk") is that this one is about two speech-writers, one for a
Republican Senatorial candidate and the other for his opponent.   This
latter may remind you of the recent marriage of James Carville, the
brains behind Clinton's campaign, and Mary Matalin, one of the leading
lights helping Bush.   However, that is mere coincidence, Life
imitating Art.</P>
<P>     More interesting than the love story is how the candidates read
the speeches over which their writers have labored.  They sound so much
like TV Anchors who frequently seem not to have the foggiest idea about
the text they are reading so beautifully and with so much charm.  The
film contains a gag about a teleprompter that has been tampered with
leading the candidate to recite "Someone's in the Kitchen with Dinah."</P>
<P>     While both Davis and Keaton are charmingly delightful and loving
as always, they seem to be even more so here and after a while it
begins to get a bit dull.  Christopher Reeve and Bonnie Bedelia help
keep the film going but their efforts are in vain.</P>
<P>Directed by Ron Underwood, whose CITY SLICKERS was a great comedy.</P>
