<P>     Movies, like literature, have always been fascinated with
twins--especially when one sibling is good and the other is evil.
Unfortunately, there's only so far this premise can be stretched, and,
over the years, Hollywood has managed to milk it for all it's worth.
Every once in a while, someone like David Cronenberg comes along with a
unique angle (DEAD RINGERS).  Most of the time, however, we get
something vapid like the Danny DeVito/Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.  In
STEAL BIG, STEAL LITTLE, an affable but too-long dramatic comedy from
THE FUGITIVE director Andrew Davis, twins are, as usual, convenient
devices upon which to hang a stale plot.</P>
<P>     Considering that one of the strengths of THE FUGITIVE was its
tight pacing, it's an unpleasant surprise that STEAL BIG, STEAL LITTLE
plods aimlessly towards a predictable conclusion.  This film is
horribly edited, resulting in a finished production that clocks in at a
bloated one-hundred thirty-five minutes.  This is epic length for a
picture that is anything but an epic.  Cutting away a half hour and
eliminating at least two of several extraneous subplots would almost
certainly have made this film more appealing.</P>
<P>     Andy Garcia, who has shown a distressing lack of range over his
last several projects, quickly makes it apparent that he's not the best
choice for either Reuben or Robby Martinez.  When playing nice-guy
Reuben, he comes across as listless rather than angelic.  As the nasty
Robby, his sneer isn't vicious enough.  Garcia doesn't quite manage to
bring either of his personalities to life, and this hurts the execution
of an already weak script.</P>
<P>     The story revolves around Reuben--the generous, caring brother
whose honesty and faithfulness to his foster mother have led to his
being the sole beneficiary of her will.  Following her death, Reuben
becomes the owner of a forty-thousand acre ranch--property he is more
than happy to share with the immigrant workers who tend to the lemon
orchards.  Robby, on the other hand, has been cut off altogether
because of past misdeeds.  However, since he believes the land to be
rightfully his, and has made plans to sell it to developers, he begins
an underhanded campaign to regain the property from his twin.  At
first, Reuben thinks it's all an elaborate game, and by the time he
realizes Robby is in earnest, it's too late.</P>
<P>     The salvation of STEAL BIG, STEAL LITTLE are superb comic
performances by Alan Arkin (as Reuben's friend and advisor, Lou
Perilli) and Joe Pantoliano (as Reuben's double-crossing lawyer).
Hilarious turns by these two resuscitate a lot of uninspired material.
The film may seem to last forever, but at least we have Arkin and
Pantoliano along for most of the ride, and their presence alleviates a
great deal of potential boredom.</P>
<P>     Aside from the length, the biggest fault in STEAL BIG, STEAL
LITTLE is that it's a retread.  The story is basically about the
importance of family and community, and how good-intentioned underdogs
can triumph over the corrupt forces of big business.  How many times
have we seen this done before, and better?  Occasional scenes of madcap
humor add a momentary spark to the predictable proceedings, but there's
never enough outrageousness to start a fire.  STEAL BIG, STEAL LITTLE
has moments when it shines--most of which feature either Arkin or
Pantoliano -- but these aren't enough to justify the excessive running
time.  Despite a laudable message and an innocuous plot, this film is
simply too long to be worth sitting through.</P>
