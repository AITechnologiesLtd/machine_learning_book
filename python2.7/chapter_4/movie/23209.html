Tranquil serenity encapsulates an isolated Greek Island. The isle is so
resplendent, so picturesque it could be interpreted as the most astute visual
poetry, a luminous, naturalistic realization of utopia. Uneasiness is detected
amidst the harmony. It's plastered all over Cassevetes' sullen visage. The man
mutters "Come on now, show me the magic," like a desperate old coot. He glares
up into the skies, with much trepidation, as if inquiring from the gods above.
They respond to his query. Darkened clouds, like so much black smoke, slowly
confine the blissful sunshine. Winds pick up, whooshing forth with great
frenzy. Lightning strikes, not hokey movie lightning, this lightning looks
authentic, and this moment feels authentic. Director Paul Mazursky has pulled
off a harrowing sequence of nature gone awry. He has effectively filmed what
Shakespeare characterized in his play TEMPEST, which Mazursky's TEMPEST is a
modernized version of. The problem is, this scene doesn't belong in the film.
It's out of place, a sorcerous event plunked down in a story that opens as an
acerbic, subtly dramatic meditation on a mid-life crisis.
 Mazursky introduces us to Philip (Cassevetes), his wife, an aging actress
(puffy haired Gena Rowlands, looking like she just walked out of a 40's film
noir), and a pixyish daughter (Molly Ringwald), all living in a modernist
apartment in Manhattan. Philip is unhappy in his seemingly immaculate life. At
first we are only moderately aware of this. He discontentedly yanks a gray hair
off his chest while carrying on a conversation with his wife who resides in the
adjacent room.
Later we experience more of his malaise. In one of the film's most surreal
moments he envisions himself slowly diving off a building while he looks on.
Actor\director John Cassevestes was a good choice for the role. Cassevetes has
a handsome, dour face, with dead eyes, a drooping nose and wild tussled hair.
He not only looks like a doomed man, but like a man who knows he's doomed.
 Philip trudges into his apartment as his wife is entertaining guests, a group
of pompous actors\directors\producer's whom she will be working with. He seems
despondent, possibly inebriated. He asks one of the guests (played by Mazursky)
to dance with him. Cassevetes relishes the scene; he plays it with a mock joy
so out of place it's downright intimidating.
 "Sing to me!" He bellows to the befuddled fellow. Mazursky begins to sing as
the two men dance arm in arm. The scene reminded me of the only effective
sequence in the recent MOD SQUAD movie, were the baddie Michael Lerner waltzes
with Omar Epps as a subtle form of dissuasion. It's evident that Cassevetes
suspects the man of foul play with his wife, or just doesn't like the
pretentious fool. He goes from gibe playfulness to corrosive anger, cumulating
into a nervous breakdown in front of everyone. These early scenes are
beautifully realized. Mazursky knows how to comically strip away falseness and
get to the core of raw emotion. The sequence is played gaudily by a capricious
Cassevetes, who widens his dark eyes in complete lunacy.
 The character undergoes a conversion not unlike Kevin Spacey in AMERICAN
BEAUTY. He quits his job and begins behaving like an aimless wacko.
 Philip drives his wife into the arms of another man, his own boss, a brazen
narcissist, played hysterically by Alfonso Alonzo. His daughter takes his side
when he resolves to vacation in Greece. Upon arriving they instantly encounter
a beautiful traveler (Susan Sarandon), with the ability to sing HAVA NAGILAH in
three different languages.
 Sarandon is a comely vision, impeccably tan, with short, amber curled hair.
She radiates more pure carnality in TEMPEST then she has since the orange scene
in ATLANTIC CITY. She's also grown as an actress. In ATLANTIC CITY she came
across as completely fallacious, just another blank pretty face. Here she
brings a light sarcasm as well as benevolent warmth to her role. Sarandon and
Cassevetes have a prodigiously mannered chemistry. He peers at her warmly, and
she returns his stares with big, inquisitive eyes, as if she were trying to get
to the core of this man, and find out what makes him tick.
 Molly Ringwald is less successful. This is her first major role and it shows.
She comes equipped with an early 80's trendy, chic teenage girl brattiness (the
new 90's trend being that of witty self-awareness), and perpetual bed head.
 Sarandon falls for Cassevestes and they relocate, with his daughter to the
aforementioned Greek isle. Only one other inhabitant resides on the island, a
buffoonish Spaniard, played with maximum jubilation by Raul Julia (with a thick
moustache to match his equally thick accent).
 So far many of Mazursky's gambits work. He has devised a whimsically messy
plot (with dark undertones) of a man on a mission to self-discovery. At a
little more than one hour in to this thing, Mazursky tries for an additional
affectivity. His heightened realism turns into surrealism. A scene in which
Raul Julia performs a mock burlesque show with a bunch of goats as his back up
doesn't belong here, but it is unsuccessfully included. Then, later the
aforementioned, "show me the magic" moment. This seems piled on in order for
Mazursky to justify his film as a Shakespeare adaptation.
 Mazursky is more adept at handling the paces of real life, not fantasy. The
island scenes begin to feel somewhat forced and awkward, like a bad concoction
of Fellini at his most indulgent and a quirky episode of GILLIGAN'S ISLAND.
Occasionally, Mazursky does manage to capture the magic he's aiming for, like
in a luminously shot scene in which Molly Ringwald and Sam Robards meet
underwater. Visuals have never usually been Mazursky's strong suit. In TEMPEST,
he changes that. The images of the island are so expansively exquisite one
could view most of the picture with the sound off and still enjoy it.
 Mazursky's screenplays have always been a little messy, comparative to the
lives he was portraying; the hustle and bustle of quirky artists in NEXT STOP
GREENWICH VILLAGE, the middle class sexual moors in BOB & CAROL & TED & ALICE.
Here he has attempted something disparate, a sprawling epic that never reaches
a destination. The messy naturalism (punctuated by messy surrealism) is
refreshing in early scenes but at two and half-hours it becomes a bit tedious.
If only he had focused his story more tightly and done away with the
Shakespeare-inspired moments, he could have had a minor classic instead of a
near miss.</P>
