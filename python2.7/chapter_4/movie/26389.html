Susan Granger's review of "THE CONTENDER" (DreamWorks)</PRE>
<P>    Is the United States really ready for a woman to be a
heartbeat away from the Presidency? That's the challenging premise of
this timely political thriller in which a Vice-President dies and
Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen) is chosen by the President (Jeff
Bridges) as his successor. Her surprise selection meets with
opposition, particularly from a powerful adversary (Gary Oldman) who
heads the Congressional confirmation hearings and prefers another
Senator (William Petersen), the hero in a recent tragic
accident. Controversy erupts when an Internet site reveals a shocking
incident from Hanson's college days, along with sexually explicit
photographs. Now a happily married mother, she doesn't deny the
allegations but refuses to discuss the sex scandal, contending that
her personal past has no relevance on her public persona. It's
principles vs. politics. Joan Allen's daring and affecting performance
is not just one of the best of the year, it's one of the screen's best
examples of a woman's vulnerable, stoic courage. This remarkable
actress never hits a false note. Jeff Bridges is quite believable, as
are Gary Oldman, William Petersen, Christian Slater, Sam Elliott, Saul
Rubinek, Mariel Hemingway and Philip Baker Hall.  The multi-layered
screenplay by Rod Lurie ("Deterrence") reveals one layer of surprise
after another and his swiftly economical direction proceeds with a
feverish sense of pace and tempo that keeps the attention
riveted. Problem is: the buxom co-ed in the lurid photo bears little
resemblance to the Senator and the heavy-handed running gag about the
White House cuisine soon gets stale. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1
to 10, "The Contender" is an intriguing, enigmatic, compelling 8,
despite Ben Franklin's referral to the post of Vice-President as "your
superfluous excellency."</P>
