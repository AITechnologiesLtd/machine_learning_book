<P>Another chilling slasher flic from the mind of the horror-meister
himself, Kevin Williamson (writer of SCREAM (8/10) and SCREAM 2). Hip
cast, hip soundtrack, hip movie.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Four high-school friends accidentally run over someone with their car
and kill him. They decide to dump the body into the water, and not tell
anybody their "incident of the summer". One year later, someone in
their town mysteriously begins to taunt them about what they "did last
summer". And that's when the haunting and scaring begins... </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Engaging horror thriller that was very reminiscent of SCREAM, and packs
a lot of thrills and chills, within its slick MTV-ized packaged
product. And even though the first hour is more mystery than anything,
don't be fooled into believing that the last half of the film doesn't
contain the many gruesome bloody murders to which we have become
accustomed. Because plenty of them do transpire (although many less
than in SCREAM). </P>
<P>I was never bored by this story, since it unfolded as it went, and
allowed the viewer to continually keep guessing on the perpetrator's
identity. That puzzle was fun, as was the costume in which the murderer
exterminated his victims (fisherman's outfit, complete with
hook...always seemed kind of eerie to me). The young, hip cast was
adequate, with Hewitt doing her best Alyssa Milano impression, and
Heche pulling off an excellent hick from the boonies. I must say that I
was surprised to find no blatant T&A shots present in this movie,
although the two female stars did sport enough tight shirts to cut the
circulation in any movie-watcher's system.</P>
<P>The down side was that much like in SCREAM, the murderer did just seem
to be around when the main cast was present, and always seemed to
disappear (a bit too conveniently at times) when anyone else appeared.
That aside, the movie intensified as it went on, charged through a
quick 90 minutes, and left enough room for one and all to look forward
to another hip, young sequel in the future, tentatively entitled I
STILL KNOW. Warm those nachos...here I come !!!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
Sarah Michelle Gellar studied Tae Kwon Do for five years, and now she's
taking kickboxing, boxing, street fighting and gymnastics.
Kevin Williamson was born to a fisherman and a story-telling mother in
New Bern, North Carolina. He set the film in a town close to his
boyhood home, Southport, because it seemed like the "ideal place for
the setting" (based on the book by Lois Duncan). The movie was actually
filmed there as well.
Williamson's dedication to writing is revealed in his daily habits.
Reportedly, he only gets four hours of sleep on a "very uncomfortable
couch, so I won't sleep too much," and then wakes at 4 am to begin
writing.</P>
