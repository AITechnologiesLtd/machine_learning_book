<P>Although Boris Karloff's makeup and performance have entered the pop culture 
realm, this "Frankenstein" version from 1931 is not the best or the most 
faithful of Mary Shelley's novel. Still, compared to most other film versions 
(there have been over 100), it is one of the most effective and perhaps, one 
of the most atmospheric. </P>
<P>James Whale's "Frankenstein" stars the harsh presence of Colin Clive as the 
mad Dr. Frankenstein, slaving away at creating life from a corpse inside a 
remote watchtower. He gets assistance from Fritz (Dwight Frye), a hunchback 
who inadvertently steals a criminal brain from the local medical school. Once 
the creation, now with a criminal brain, is brought to life with the use of 
electrical devices and a brewing storm, it begins to wreck havoc, escaping 
his prison and tormenting the local villagers. Eventually, Frankenstein 
leaves the castle for more modest surroundings, and is ready to marry his 
adoring Elizabeth (Mae Clarke) until terror strikes again in the face of the 
wandering Monster. </P>
<P>There are far too many inconsistencies in the film to warrant the heaps of 
praise it has received since it was initially released. Number one: how does 
the Monster know about Frankenstein's bride-to-be and why does he attack her? 
Number two: how is it that a villager knows his drowned daughter was murdered 
by the Monster? Could she not have just drowned? Number three: where does the 
film take place? Germany? Scotland? And what is with all the German and 
Slavic names when everyone speaks with an English accent? </P>
<P>Such inconsistencies aside, "Frankenstein" certainly has a lot to recommend 
it. Karloff is menacing, tender, sympathetic, cruel, and pathetic as the 
Monster - his first appearance where he walks slowly facing Frankenstein and 
stares inertly still sends chills to my spine. I admire Colin Clive's 
hard-edged performance as the scientist - he shows the doctor's mental 
breakdown and exhaustion perfectly. Mae Clarke does not have a lot of screen 
time but she is sweetly innocent - her scenes with John Boles as Victor, 
Henry and Elizabeth's mutual friend, suggests that Victor has mutual 
affection for her. Edward Van Sloan (who appeared the same year as Professor 
Van Helsing in "Dracula") is the most watchable presence on screen as an old 
professor who has a keen interest in this creation, though he is nonplussed 
by it at the beginning. He also presents the film in a prologue, which had 
not been in all existing prints, where he warns the audience that it may 
shock them, perhaps terrify them.</P>
<P>"Frankenstein" had some major trims in its original release thanks to the 
Production Code. One was the deletion of Maria's drowning, as she is thrown 
in the lake by the Monster who expects her to float like the daisies. 
Originally, it had just shown the Monster smiling and reaching out its hands 
to the girl. This minor trim makes the preceding scene of her father carrying 
her lifeless body far more violent than intended. </P>
<P>The other deletion was a line of dialogue said by Dr. Frankenstein after the 
first signs of life in the Monster. The deleted line - "In the name of God, 
now I know what it feels like to be God" - was certainly essential and in 
keeping with Mary Shelley's theme of man's attempt to emulate God. </P>
<P>"Frankenstein" is not a perfect film and not nearly as unifying as a whole as 
the superior "Bride of Frankenstein," the latter in my estimation is the best 
damn version ever. If nothing else, Karloff still makes one shudder and that 
is enough to consider the film a horror classic - he makes the film his own.  </P>
