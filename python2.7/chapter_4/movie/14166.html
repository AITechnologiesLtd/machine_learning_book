<PRE>WRONGFULLY ACCUSED
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Talk about beating a dead horse.  Leslie Nielsen is still trying to
squeeze the last drop of humor out of the spoof comedy.  Give up!  It's
bone-dry, as his latest comedic train wreck, Wrongfully Accused, can
attest.</P>
<P>The film roughly follows the plot of The Fugitive, but spoofs a variety
of films in-between, from The Empire Strikes Back to Titanic. Leslie
Nielsen's bumbling fool this time around is Ryan Harrison, master
violinist.  He's falsely accused of murder and must escape to find the
real killer:  a one armed, one legged, one eyed man (Aaron Pearl).</P>
<P>In the Tommy Lee Jones role here is Richard Crenna as Fergus Falls, the
U.S. Marshal assigned to track Harrison down.  You'd think that the
filmmakers would be able to get some mileage out of Tommy Lee Jones'
Oscar-winning role.  No such luck.  Crenna barks out orders in
Jones-style, but his character is so uninteresting that he goes missing
for most of the film's last third, and you never notice the difference.</P>
<P>And of course the film has to have some sort of love interest.  That job
is dually provided by Kelly LeBrock and Melinda McGraw.  One of these
women has Ryan's best interests at heart...the other wants to kill him.
But he doesn't know which is which, and the audience couldn't care less.</P>
<P>The film is packed with wall-to-wall non sequitur gags, but the film's
escape sequence is the only one which even mildly works, and it is
mostly successful only in comparison to the rest of the film.</P>
<P>One of the big problems with the humor here is the source material.
Rather than spoofing a genre, Wrongfully Accused decided to spoof one
specific film, The Fugitive. As all the comedic potential is tapped
early, the film grasps out for other sources of inspiration.  However,
the amalgamated hodgepodge of scenes are so desperately humorless that
it seems the filmmakers are simply playing a game of "Guess Which Film
We're Spoofing Now!"</P>
<P>There have been worse spoof comedys...but not many.  For the crime of
being unfunny, Wrongfully Accused is guilty, guilty, guilty.</P>
