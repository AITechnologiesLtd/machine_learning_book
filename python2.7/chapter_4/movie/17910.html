<PRE>THE MATRIX Review by CHASE McCOWN</PRE>
<P>THE MATRIX, 144 minutes, Rated R for language and sci-fi violence.
CAST:  Keanu Reeves (Neo), Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus), Carrie-Anne Moss
(Trinity), Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith) </P>
<P>Have you ever wanted to walk out of a movie, but felt that you would be cheated
out of $6.00?  Have you ever laughed when no one else was laughing because the
acting was so insipid and the lines just as inane?  Have you ever been to a
movie that was...just that bad?</P>
<P>If the answer to any of these questions is "yes," then maybe you've seen THE
MATRIX, a movie that takes itself so seriously that it unintentionally comes
across as a comedy.</P>
<P>Then again, what can you expect from a movie that stars "Ted" ("Bill and Ted's
Excellent Adventure" star Keanu Reeves) and some girl from the ill-fated TV
series "Models Inc." (Carrie-Anne Moss)?  There were times when I just couldn't
help but laugh out loud...like, the time when Keanu Reeves' character
enlightens us with the revelation, "I know kung fu."  Such forced dialogue and
a humorously unrealistic plot make up THE MATRIX.</P>
<P>Sometime in the 21st century, Neo (a computer hacker) discovers that all life
on Earth is merely a complicated illusion created by evil cyber-based people so
that each human body can be used to provide energy for the Matrix's world
domination plot (the real world, that is...not the cyber-based facade where we
are all supposedly dwelling).  Neo is "chosen" by rebels Morpheus, Trinity, and
an array of other one-dimensional characters to defeat the Matrix.</P>
<P>I realize that I am in the minority when I say that I truly loathed this movie.
 I can't understand why in the world critics have given it such good reviews. 
Aside from the special effects (yes, they truly were amazing), I found nothing
redeeming in the acting, the plot, or the screenplay.  Hello Hollywood!  Some
of us DO look for those elements when we pay good money to go to the
multiplexes of America.</P>
<P>Writers and directors Andy and Larry Wachowski (whose previous credits include
the Jennifer Tilly nightmare BOUND) have certainly made some interesting
statements with MATRIX.  What I learned was:
1)  When making a movie, acting is a small sacrifice if there are "awesome"
special effects!
2)  If there should happen to be loopholes in the plot, no one will notice,
because there are some kickin' special effects!
3)  The Matrix has your money.</P>
<PRE>RATING (1 = steer clear, 5 = perfection on film):
THE MATRIX has a 1.5.</PRE>
