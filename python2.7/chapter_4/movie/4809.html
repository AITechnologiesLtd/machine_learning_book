<PRE>                                RESTORATION
                       A film review by John Schuurman

<P>     In 1660 England awakens to a "New Age." What the Cavaliers like to
call "Enlightenment" returns after a dismal rule of a dozen or so years
by Cromwell and his gloomy Puritans. Now, at last, "rich men can go to
heaven agai n." The charming Charles II is restored to the throne and
sets up what has long been regarded as England's most decadent court.
Megalomaniac that he is, he also makes plans for one of the most
ambitious building projects ever known to man, a tribute to his royal
person.</P>
<P>     But not everything is so "enlightened" and free of shadow. Not all
flesh delights. For there still lingers in the land the superstitions
of the masses and the unctuous airs of the religious; but more than
them all, the Bl ack Plague, that indiscriminate killer of millions, is
rumored to be lurking again. As the fun guy Charles II says in one of
his reflective moments, "The plague rouses men from their sleep."</P>
<P>     RESTORATION is a fine film surrounded by this conflicted world.
Michael Hoffman and his army of technical and research people, have
restored to us this time and place. We have seen a lot of cinematic
treatments of various periods of English history of late, "Brave
Heart," "Rob Roy," "Sense and Sensibility," and "Persuasion," to name
but a few, but I don't recall one so careful and so splendid. This is
painstaking film-making at its very best.</P>
<P>     RESTORATION is what the industry calls "A Coming of Age" film. But
it is not as innocuous a coming of age as most of Hollywood's fare. A
sign on the doorpost of a Quaker asylum for the mentally ill quotes
Isaiah 48:10 "Be hold, I have refined thee in the furnace of
affliction." We can watch the burning away of the character's baser
elements on several levels.</P>
<P>     Walking us through the tumultuous time and countryside is a gifted
but licentious young physician, Rowe Merivel. His life is in disarray
from the outset because of his philandering; his taste for women even
gets him into trouble in the court of Charles. As we travel with Rowe,
we marvel and wonder at the sumptuous life. We also share the
consternation of his good friend and fellow physician, John Pierce, a
quiet (and not at all unctuous) Quaker. John sees in Rowe someone that
God has uniquely gifted with a surgeon's heart and hands. We, with
John, hate it when we see Rowe waste the gift. But as tumult moves into
ever greater tumult, we see Rowe "come of age." With each new trouble,
we see more of the man, less of the baser nature. There is within him
something we hoped we would see and at the end he is responsible,
respected and (probably) chaste.</P>
<P>     Something similar happens to Charles, and, (since the king is the
microcosm of the country), to merry old England herself, (you can do
this kind of thing in the movies). As the plague creeps in and attacks
the kingdom and the royal household, Charles and England experience
refinment in the furnace of affliction too. The great fire of London in
1666 is what it takes to purge the city of the plague. It also purges
Charles of his grand desig ns. At the end, we see the two of them
chastened (if not chaste)</P>
