<P>     FEAST OF JULY, which arrives under the Merchant/Ivory umbrella
(Ismail Merchant having served as executive producer), is much like a
big screen version of a double-length MASTERPIECE THEATER episode.  By
turns tragic and beautiful, but always atmospheric, this adaptation H.E.
Bates' novel focuses on the dark side of love and the grotesque capacity
for violence hidden deep within the meekest human being.</P>
<P>     The film opens with a pregnant young woman, Bella Ford (Embeth
Davidz), struggling across the windswept countryside of late Victorian
England.  Unmarried and alone, she is undergoing a 30-mile journey to
find the father of her unborn child.  By the time she reaches the town
where he claims to live (but in fact doesn't), she has miscarried.
Exhausted and weak, she is taken in by a kindly local family, and soon
becomes a member of the household.  The sons--Con (Ben Chaplin), Jedd
(James Purefoy), and Matty (Kenneth Anderson)--vie with each other for
her attention, and, on one occasion, this sibling rivalry turns violent.
For her part, Bella is attracted to all three, although one eventually
rises above the others in her estimation.  But he must compete with
Bella's memories of her lost love, a scoundrel who suddenly re-appears.</P>
<P>     There's no doubt that FEAST OF JULY is, at heart, a tragic
melodrama.  But, at least in its appraisal of human nature, it aspires
to something greater.  Despite the trappings of civilization, man is
still an animal, and even the gentlest of people can be driven by
uncontrollable passions to do terrible things.  Reason has never been
able to master love, and FEAST OF JULY illustrates the devastating
results of one moment's irrational blindness.  For, in this sort of
fiction, if not always in real life, crime has consequences.</P>
<P>     While Embeth Davidz doesn't give the same degree of wrenching
performance she delivered as Helen Hirsch in SCHINDLER'S LIST, she is
nevertheless effective as the figure at the focus of FEAST OF JULY's
events.  Like Patricia Arquette in ETHAN FROME, Davidz doesn't initially
seem right for the part, but it doesn't take much screen time for her to
change the viewer's opinion.  In her understated portrayal, we see an
eloquent expression of desperation.</P>
<P>     As is almost always the case in British productions, the sense of
atmosphere is masterful.  Director Christopher Menaul (PRIME SUSPECT)
has used all the tools at his disposal, including rich cinematography by
Peter Sova and a haunting score by longtime Kieslowski collaborator
Zbigniew Preisner, to craft a realistic portrait of a private tragedy.
Even though the circumstances are outdated, the emotional core of FEAST
OF JULY is timeless.</P>
<P>     Joy is a scarce commodity in this film, and there's little
opportunity for comic relief to lighten the tension.  FEAST OF JULY is
not for those seeking an uplifting motion picture experience.  As
accomplished as Menaul's technique is, the film is a real
downer--tissues are a recommended accessory.  The main dish served up
at this particular FEAST is raw emotion.</P>
