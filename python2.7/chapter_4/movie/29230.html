<PRE>RAT RACE
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Crazies, Lucille Ball impersonators, redneck garage mechanics,
neo-Nazis, dykes on bikes, cross-dressers, electrified dogs, flying
cows, vomit contests, vindictive girlfriends, and Rowan Atkinson's
horrible Italian accent are the elements of success for Rat Race, the
latest hilarious remake of It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.</P>
<P>I know how bad it sounds.  But thanks to the comedic talents of Jon
Lovitz, Atkinson, John Cleese, and Whoopi Goldberg, plus a sharp script
written by Andy Breckman (a writer for TV Funhouse and one of the best
Richard Pryor movies, Moving) Rat Race is much better than it should
be.  In the end, it's summer junk food for the soul.</P>
<P>Through the orchestration of casino owner Donald Sinclair (John Cleese
in one of best performances in recent years), six groups of people are
brought together in a Vegas casino to race against each other in an
attempt to reach a satchel of $2 million in locker 001 in the train
station at Silver Lake, New Mexico.</P>
<P>The Pear family (headed by Jon Lovitz) finds its family vacation in
Vegas interrupted, and the Cody brothers (Seth Green and Vince Vieluf)
are two con artists whose personal injury suit against the casino goes
awry.  Mr. Pollini (Rowan Atkinson), an extremely cheerful but
narcoleptic Italian man, represents the hare of this story.  After
falling asleep on the way out of the casino, he gets hit by a creepy
ambulance driver named Zack (Wayne Knight) who is on his way to New
Mexico with a live heart in a cooler.  Owen Templeton (Cuba Gooding Jr.)
is a disavowed NFL coach who blew a major call and is drowning himself
in alcohol at the casino's bar.  Vera (Whoopi Goldberg) and her
estranged daughter Merrill have reunited at the casino after Vera gave
up Merrill for adoption years ago.  Nick (Breckin Meyer) is an uptight
lawyer-in-training.  All of these clowns earn a shot at the money and
head out across the desert.</P>
<P>Rat Race starts off with a mildly humorous tone and then unexpectedly
ramps up to a full-blown gut buster.  Jerry Zucker, co-director of such
classics as Top Secret! and Airplane!, lends a veteran hand at handling
the pace of the comedy and keeps the laughs coming in waves. </P>
<P>The main drawback of the film, though, is the lack of a solid third
act.  The humor completely dries up when all of the parties converge
onstage with the band Smash Mouth.  It ends up feeling like an old
Three's Company episode.  And about as funny.</P>
