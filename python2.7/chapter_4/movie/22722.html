RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>There are many reasons why people like certain movies, but
often those reasons are quite sentimental in their nature.
For example, author of this review likes RAIDERS OF THE LOST
ARK because this film - among other things, of course -
brings back nice memories. This film was also not only the
subject of my very first movie review, but also the reason
why I started reading movie reviews in newspapers and paying
attention what the critics actually think about movies.</P>
<P>Year 1981, when the movie was made, actually belongs to my
very personal Golden Age of movies. Majority of my favourite
films was made in late 1970s and early 1980s and they left
long lasting impact on my future viewing preferences.
RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, although not belonging to my
favourite genre of science fiction and being quite different
from mostly dark and thought-provoking visions of the
future, also became my favourite. Mastery of Steven
Spielberg, director who began his slow, but unstoppable
climb to the title of Hollywood king, enchanted me with his
magical vision of the past.</P>
<P>The plot begins in 1936. Indiana "Indy" Jones (played by
Harrison Ford) is shy and mild-mannered college professor of
archaeology, but when the college museum headed by Marcus
Brody (played by Denholm Elliott) needs new artefacts,
Indiana Jones is turned into experienced and fearless
explorer who would stop at nothing to make archaeological
finds even in the most dangerous places of the world. His
talents are being employed by U.S. Army Intelligence, since
Hitler recently became obsessed with the occult and sent
expedition in Egypt to recover the lost biblical artefact
known as the Ark of the Covenant. That mythical object
contains immense powers and army carrying it is believed to
be invincible. Indiana Jones doesn't believe in it, but he
would prefer to lay his hands on Ark before Hitler does. So,
he goes on the journey and the first stop is Nepal, where an
old colleague, Professor Ravenwood, should help him with an
ancient medallion showing the way to the Ark. Instead of
friend, he finds his daughter Marion (played by Karen
Allen), who still can't forgive Indiana for the heartbreak
caused ten years ago. Marion's dilemma about helping him
resolved after the visit by Nazi spies, led by sadistic Toht
(played by Ronald Lacey). Indy and Marion continue their
journey to Cairo, where Sallah (played by John Rhys-Davies),
top local digger and Indy's old friend, brings news about
German expedition making major excavation in the desert.
Their effort, that dug out ancient Egyptian city, is
intended towards the room with the Ark. "Indy" is going to
use medallion to find the Ark, and his quest is even more
motivated when he finds out that the Nazis are helped by
Rene Belloq (played by Paul Freeman), French archaeologist
and his arch-rival.</P>
<P>In the interviews that followed smashing success of STAR
WARS, George Lucas often named B-movies and cliff-hanger
serials of 1930s and 1940s as the major source of
inspiration. Four years later, it turned out that the same
material shaped the movie preferences of Spielberg, and
Lucas, together with Lawrence Kasdan, created movie
character that became embodiment of all heroes featured in
such films. For Spielberg RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was
intended as nothing more than nostalgic trip to the past,
where such films spawned juvenile imagination with exotic
locations and breath-taking stunts. But his personal
nostalgia was quite in tune with the demand of audience -
those masses that got tired of dark, serious, cynical
protagonists of 1970s cinema and desired return of
old-fashioned heroes, ready to fight old-fashioned villains
and get old-fashioned girls in the end. This renaissance of
simplistic Good vs. Evil worldview, embodied in renaissance
of American self-confidence and national pride in Reagan's
years, was just one of the reasons why this film became one
of the first true summer blockbusters.</P>
<P>Another reason was the fact that Spielberg's artistic vision
proved to be perfect for such kind of films - pure and
ideologically unburdened juvenile adventures. Spielberg
excelled in all areas of filmmaking when he directed RAIDERS
OF THE LOST ARK. From brilliantly staged opening scene in
Peruvian jungle that remains memorable despite not being
particularly related to the rest of the film, until the
last, equally memorable scene, audience has opportunity to
enjoy Spielbergian magic at its best. Action scenes are
spectacular and exciting, but script by Lucas and Kasdan
allows enough room for character development yet never
hurting the perfect pacing of the film. There are many
scenes of violence and the amount of blood and gore might be
somewhat unsuitable for youngest audience; unfortunately,
Spielberg was somewhat more squeamish in scenes that could
be viewed as erotic. Dark and potentially disturbing
overtones of the film are compensated with humour and catchy
one-liners. General light-hearted tone of the film helps us
to suspend disbelief and digest certain anachronisms (1936
Germans armed with 1938 submachinguns) or implausibilites
(British allowing Nazis to deploy force equivalent to
Rommel's Afrikakorps outside Suez three years before the
war). Spielberg's long-time associate John Williams provided
RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK with one of his powerful musical
scores and one of the most recognisable title themes.</P>
<P>By playing lead character of Indiana Jones, Harrison Ford
finally became Hollywood star in true sense, silencing all
those who saw him as "one hit wonder" and predicted same
fate as other STAR WARS leads. Ford was talented enough to
utilise all potential of his, superficially cartoonish,
character and create hero who is both traditional and
complex - troubled with his own imperfections (snake phobia)
and self-doubts. Karen Allen as Marion was his ideal partner
- woman who is both strong, tough, intelligent yet feminine
and charming. Unfortunately, Karen Allen failed to use this
role as boost for her future career. British actor Paul
Freeman as Belloq gave anything but routine role of villain
with complex motivations. Other two memorable roles were
also played by reliable character actors from Britain - John
Rhys-Davies (of SLIDERS fame) is one of rare Muslim good
guys in modern Hollywood, and Ronald Lacey was impressive in
his Peter Lorre impersonation.</P>
<P>Cliff-hanger movie serials and B-movies from 1930 and 1940s,
of course, weren't the only source of inspiration for
Spielberg. Another thing that makes this film so valuable is
the fact that it could be seen as some kind of movie
encyclopaedia due to the numerous references to various
movies made in 20th Century. Filmophiles would probably
enjoy seeing nods given to movie classics like CASABLANCA,
or the famous scene that pays homage to Kurosawa, flying
date that gives homage to Kubrick's bone in 2001 and even
Spielberg's use of relatively obscure (for American
audience) Belmondo adventures directed by French filmmaker
Philip de Broca in early 1960s. Some of the referenced
movies are rather recent, and Spielberg makes very explicit
homage to his partner's STAR WARS. Ironically, Indiana Jones
later became not just a movie icon itself and object of
numerous references (and two inferior sequels plus
disappointing TV series), but also a recognisable cultural
icon (with "Hungry Like a Wolf" clip by Duran Duran being
one of the first examples).</P>
<P>RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK might be inferior to STAR WARS in
terms of cultural importance, but this film still deserves
to be praised as Hollywood masterpieces and loved even by
those viewers who aren't as sentimentally attached to it as
the author of this review.</P>
