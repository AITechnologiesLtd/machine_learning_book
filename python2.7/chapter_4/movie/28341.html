<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A suspenseful melodrama about a nervous guy who is haunted by a dream of
him murdering his mistress. It's good in parts, but it fails to deliver
in its unbelievable surprise ending.</P>
<P>John North (Richard Todd) is an unsuccessful author who is having an
affair with the wife of his alcoholic editor, Jerves Wilding (Alexander
Gauge). He plans to runaway to London with Susan Wilding (Christine
Norden) by train. On the train, he changes his mind and pulls the
communication cord and jumps off the train at his home stop. But his
actions cause the train to suddenly stop and that causes a deadly crash
in which his lover is killed. Hence the title, Interrupted Journey.</P>
<P>He is visited by a railway detective, Mr. Clayton (Tom Walls), who
suspects him of being on the train and pulling the cord. He shows the
Norths a notebook he found in the wreckage of a private detective
following Susan, and it details his relationship with her. He's also
told that Jerves was on the train and was also killed. He finally
confesses to his wife that he was going to runaway with Susan but
changed his mind. In flashbacks we see the conflict over money matters
he is having with his wife and how she wants him to write at night as a
hobby, but to take a steady daytime paying job in her father's chemical
factory.</P>
<P>One of the twists in the plot comes when Clayton tells him that they
discovered Susan was shot in the back and he's now suspected of
murdering her. They find the gun used to kill her in his garden pond and
come to arrest him. But he eludes them, and on a hunch goes to the hotel
room he was going to stay with Susan. There he meets Jerves, who faked
his death and framed North. The film comes to a trick ending when Jerves
is about to shoot North.</P>
<P>It is interesting to note that the supportive wife is played by Valerie
Hobson, whose patience and support came to a test in real life when she
stood by her husband John
Profumo during the British Parliament sex scandals of the early 1960s.</P>
