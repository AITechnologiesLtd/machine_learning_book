<PRE>THE SEASON OF MEN
A film review by Rachel Gordon
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>The Season of Men is a ponderous portrait of Arab women slowly freeing
themselves from tradition, each generation getting just a touch more
gutsy than the one before it.</P>
<P>Aicha (Rabia Ben Abdallah) is the matron who starts the domino effect. 
After being married to Said (Ezzedine Gennoun) for some time, she
decides she doesn't want to wait for the one month of the year that he
returns, as is the custom of the village.  Said finally relents that if
she bears him a son, the family will move to the city with him.  It's
the dream of every woman in the village, each wife takes turns to
joyfully brag about it even knowing the chances it will actually happen
are slim.</P>
<P>She bears two healthy girls, Meriem (Ghania Benali) and Emna (Hend
Sabri), and finally a son, Aziz (Adel Hergal).  But after having moved
to be close to Said, it becomes apparent that Aziz has health problems,
and Aicha is blamed for this.  Now, even more estranged from Said, Aicha
decides to move back home with her daughters in tow.</P>
<P>But Aicha finds it difficult to keep close tabs on her growing
daughters.  Meriem is married but can't seem to provide her husband with
sex whereas Emna sleeps with a married man and doesn't acknowledge
tradition at all.</P>
<P>This setup could have become a gripping story of women coming into
independent power, but it falls short of the mark by concentrating too
much on flashbacks to drive cultural difficulties home.  Again and again
we see Aicha fight with her overbearing, power-hungry mother-in-law for
the rights of her daughters.  And when these scenes aren't taking over,
there's always a cryptic "character looking in the mirror" shot right
around the corner.</P>
<P>It is regrettable that the story doesn't focus more on interaction
between Aicha and her daughters in the present.  After all, Aicha has
chosen to drag them away from their lives, due to Aziz's constant need
for care.  Instead of elaborating on how these women are becoming
different from their predecessors, it repetitively concentrates on
scenes of feminine claustrophobia within the community.</P>
<P>Still, there are beautifully poignant moments to this film.  Each
character is able to shine through a mixture of emotions.  Watching
Aicha stand up for her rights during especially emotional scenes demands
respect for her decisions, even when they are fallible.  Emna is allowed
a strong, simple exploration of what she's learned when she tells her
married lover that she never wants to marry.  The overall strength of
these women is articulated well through being three-dimensional instead
of perfect icons.</P>
<P>The men are thankfully not seen as completely tyrannical, which is
unusual for a film about female empowerment.  For the most part they are
simply following tradition, and some are open to allowing women more
space.</P>
<P>The cultural details can also be refreshing, such as how these women
prepare for their men with henna.  It is interesting to see how every
person in a given family has a specific task no matter their skill. 
Aziz is a young boy with health problems, but he is put to work weaving
carpets.</P>
<P>The Season of Men is a unique cultural study of gradual feminine growth
within a strict community.  Though it has its share of misses, it is
still a positive and reflexive look at a people much ignored.</P>
