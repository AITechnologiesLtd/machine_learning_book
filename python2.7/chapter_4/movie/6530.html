<PRE>                             MY FELLOW AMERICANS
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     One of the greatest pleasures in being a film critic is finding
unexpected gems.  MY FELLOW AMERICANS was just such a movie for me.</P>
<P>     First, let me give some background on my tastes.  All movie goers
have preferences whether they admit it or not.  There are always those
actors whom they seldom like and certain genres that are their least
favorites.</P>
<P>     I rarely like James Garner or Jack Lemon although I know they both
have talent.  Most recently I saw James Garner's in MAVERICK (1994) and
Jack Lemon in HAMLET (1996), and I did not care for either of their
performances. Lemon is the only actor among a large cast that I did not
like in the phenomenal four hour HAMLET.  As far as genre, old men
buddy pictures rank right along with dumb teenager flicks among the
ones I try my best to avoid.</P>
<P>     So it was that I approached the press screening of MY FELLOW
AMERICANS with much trepidation.  That Dan Aykroyd is in it, further
heightened my concern.  He is an actor I once liked, but who seems to
have lost his way of late, playing in such disasters as FEELING
MINNESOTA (1996).</P>
<P>     Well, let me cut to the chase.  I laughed, and I laughed hard from
start to finish while watching MY FELLOW AMERICANS.  Garner and Lemon
are on the screen roughly eighty percent of the time and usually they
are alone.  The movie consists of one put down after another,
frequently double entendres.  The script by Jack Kaplan, Richard
Chapman and Peter Tolan is full of high spirited and intelligent
comedy.  The show pulsates with energy and the fast paced music by
William Ross just adds to the fun.</P>
<P>     As the show opens, Republican Russell Kramer (Lemon) is elected
president over his hated rival Democrat Matt Douglas (Garner).  Four
years later Douglas defeats Kramer.  Then four years later still,
Republican William Haney (Aykroyd) beats Douglas.  The story takes
place three years into the Haney administration.  There is a scandal
about Haney, but Haney's people plant evidence throwing the blame to
Kramer.</P>
<P>     After a murder, the government has hit men after both Kramer and
Douglas.  The body of the story is a long chase where the government
assassins after them.  If it seems far fetched, it is, but the beauty
is that director Peter Segal manages to make it seem just plausible
enough that the audience does not feel insulted.  Segal has a deft
touch so that the comedic barbs are delivered with perfect timing.</P>
<P>     In a show that manages to ridicule both parties, John Heard plays
Haney's bumbling Vice President Ted Matthews, who is designed to be a
Dan Quayle clone.  He even says, "Funny thing is everybody thinks I'm
this big idiot, and its all a big facade."  He mispronounces facade as
fah-sid.</P>
<P>     Haney is a president who smiles constantly in front of the
cameras, but behind the scenes is trying to hide the crooked deals he
was involved in before he took office.  You can guess whom the
screenwriters had in mind when they created his character.</P>
<P>     Most of the show is about the long chase of Kramer and Douglas.
When Kramer accidentally says something complimentary, Douglas is
repulsed and barks back, "Let's stop talking.  We're about to bond.  It
will make me vomit."  Usually Kramer has nothing but insults for
Douglas.  When Kramer finds a way out of the forest, he taunts Douglas
with, "As usual, the Republicans come up with a plan while the
Democrats wander aimlessly in the woods."</P>
<P>     When they get a ride with some poor people who have lost their
jobs and live in their car, the woman of the family tells Douglas, "I'm
sorry, but we're Republicans."  Not missing a beat, Douglas replies,
"At least you admit it.  That's the first step to recovery."</P>
<P>     The show has a great gay hero who calls himself Dorothy when they
meet him.  His role is a small but crucial one.</P>
<P>     If you are looking for some good old fashioned humor, MY FELLOW
AMERICANS is the genuine article.  Not the best show out this Christmas
season, but the most pleasant surprise.</P>
<P>     MY FELLOW AMERICANS runs a fast 1:41.  It is rated PG-13.  There
is no sex or nudity.  There is a little violence and some bad language.
Given the level of sexual humor, the show would be appropriate only for
kids say ten and up.  I had a great time at the film.  I recommend it
and can easily give the picture ***.  I almost rated even higher.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
