<P>There's just no middle ground when it comes to Eddie Murphy films.  It's
either a throw-your-hands-in-the-air blockbuster that spawns an incredible
amount of sequels (like Beverly Hills Cop, 48 Hours, The Nutty Professor
and, eventually Shrek), or a flop that is swept under the carpet so quickly
that most people have forgotten it ever existed (like Holy Man, Vampire in
Brooklyn and Metro).  What is it about Murphy that makes people want to
watch him play the same roles over and over again?  You don't see it with
his comedic contemporaries, like Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey (I'm still
pretending Ace Ventura 2 never happened).  Murphy could probably pump a
sequel to Professor out every two years and still gross well over $100
million at the box office each time.</P>
<P>Dr. Dolittle 2 probably won't be much of an exception, but that certainly
doesn't mean it's a good film.  In fact, it will probably gross less than
the first version did, which brings up another interesting point about
Murphy:  How come the films in which he doesn't primarily appear as himself
make so much less money?  Think about it.  People love his voice work in
animation (Shrek, Mulan) and think it's great when he's hidden behind fat
suits and prosthetics (Professor), but when it's just Eddie, it's usually a
bomb.  Not counting Dolittle, which was really more about the talking
animals than Murphy, his last genuine box-office hit that wasn't either
animated or a sequel was 13 years ago (Coming to America).  Most of Dolittle
2's target audience wasn't even alive back then.</P>
<P>In Dolittle 2, Murphy reprises his role as the titular John Dolittle, a San
Francisco doctor who, since the closing credits rolled in the 1998 original,
has become a world-famous, globetrotting superstar, much to the displeasure
of his neglected family.  His practice now treats both humans and animals,
and Dolittle spends a lot of free time with various animal support groups,
as well.  When he does manage to find his way home, the family's quiet
moments are routinely interrupted by animals with strange physical ailments
looking for the healing hands of the good doctor.</P>
<P>One such interruption comes via a wiseguy raccoon (Michael Rappaport) who
swears he's not in the Mafia and insists Dolittle meet his boss, the Beaver
(Richard C. Sarafian).  The Beaver tries to enlist Dolittle to stop the
deforestation of a large wooded area outside San Francisco proper.
Dolittle's attorney wife (Kristen Wilson) advises him the only way to stop
the loggers (led by 3000 Miles to Graceland's Kevin Pollack and Sleepy
Hollow's Jeffrey Jones) from going chop-crazy is to find an endangered
species in the forest and attempt to create offspring of said species.
There is one rare female Pacific Northwest bear (Lisa Kudrow, Lucky
Numbers), but the only male in existence has been working in a circus his
entire life (Steve Zahn, Saving Silverman).  Will Dolittle postpone his
family's much-needed vacation to attempt mating a circus bear with a forest
bear?  Do they shit in the woods?  (The bears, not the Dolittles.)</P>
<P>Dolittle and family move to the forest, where the doctor tries to train
Archie the circus bear to survive in the wild (they call it a
"bear-a-thon"), and the bear even helps him learn a little bit about
himself, too.  And the whole time, all I could think of was the Robert
Schimmel joke (Q. How do they teach bears to ride bikes?  A. They nail their
feet to the pedals and beat the shit out them.) that was funnier than
anything in the movie.  The animals piss, shit and fart up a storm, and
there's enough gags about ball-licking and various sexual acts to make you
wonder how this earned a PG rating.  But what else would you expect from a
film that is narrated by a talking dog (Norm Macdonald) and stars a drunken,
sweater-wearing monkey?</P>
<P>The original Dolittle (not the Rex Harrison one) was directed by Betty
Thomas, who was hot off the success of Private Parts and Late Shift.  This
time, the reins are handed to Steve Carr, whose only feature film credit was
the nearly unwatchable Next Friday.  Carr has worked on numerous music
videos for the likes of Method Man, Jay-Z and Redman - not exactly a sound
pick for a children's film, but stranger things have happened (remember
Julia Roberts and Lyle Lovett?).  I'm not sure Dolittle is bad enough to
have original author Hugh Lofting spinning in his grave, but it ain't no
Babe, either.</P>
