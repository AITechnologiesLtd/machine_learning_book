<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>I'm not a fan of glam rock, my musical partialities are more in the line
for classical music or '60s rock. Glam is the kind of music that is
pretty to look at for short periods of time but when more closely
scrutinized could turn ugly. That is both the virtue and problem with
this entertaining and stylish celebration of the rock music scene by
Todd Haynes (Safe/Poison), that has the right musical feel but offers no
depth and little character development in its story. This fictionalized
story is a thin disguise for David Bowie's bio, and it was able along
the way to rip-off the Citizen Kane way of telling a biography in a
fictionalized way. And if that weren't enough of a splash in the water
of cause célèbre, Haynes throws a bit of the Oscar Wilde biography into
the fiction presented. He, of course, can be assumed to be the patron
saint for all such "rock dandies."</P>
<P>Glam rock star Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), who acts catlike as a
character named Maxwell Demon, predicts his own death onstage. The death
is found out to be a hoax and his career is ruined. It is 1984, ten
years later than that incident, and a New York newspaper editor assigns
a reporter Arthur Stuart (Christian Bale) to see if he can dig up what
happened to the rock star, sending him back to London, the reporter's
place of birth and early tribulation.</P>
<P>The reporter interviews his first manager, who is seen in a wheelchair
(remember Joseph Cotten in Citizen Kane!), as he tells of how he was
dastardly replaced by the flamboyant manager Jerry Divine (Brit
comedian-Izzard), and then he interviews the star's ex-wife Mandy
(Collette), now a drunken burnout, as he tries to unravel the mysteries
of the enigmatic performer. What he finds is a show biz of glitter
glamor, a musician wearing a mask so he can become who he is, the coming
out party for a bisexual revolution, the wreckage of a marriage and his
career (similar to Orson Welles's Hollywood career going down after
Citizen Kane), and the great love affair between Brian and an American
performance artist, the junkie Curt Wild (Ewan McGregor), who influences
that style of performing onto Brian, seeing dollar signs in Brian's eyes
instead of the love that was in Brian's eyes. It resulted in a ménage à
trois, among Brian, Curt, and Mandy, taking place in the swinging London
of the 1970s, with a most unsentimental view of their lifestyle being
presented.</P>
<P>The film works best as a music video and if you like the music, you'll
probably love the film. As a film it was a colorful spectacle,
wonderfully performed, very energetic, and it had some witty dialogue;
but, it failed to tell a cohesive story and failed to capture what that
period of the 1970s was about. It was hard to tell what Haynes was
trying to expose or tell about this fictionalized Bowie-Ziggy
Stardust-like character. The film made no comment about the money angle
in the business, or the public- or- the private thoughts of the
musician. It was all vague and superficial, I suppose, just like glamor
is. Besides, I don't really know how worthwhile it is to uncover his
mystery life-like who cares! Anyway, he wasn't made into an interesting
character by Slade's characterization of him-I think David Bowie is a
much more interesting character than Brian Slade. When Mandy explains
his downfall by saying he got lost in a lie, it is hard to feel any
sympathy for him or for those he took down with him.</P>
<P>If you don't mind having an empty feeling after seeing a film, then this
one could be your kind of nourishment. There was some attempt to bring a
deeper storyline into focus, as the sexually inhibited reporter assigned
to the story was actually in attendance on the night of Slade's hoax,
and he was shown in flashback to be influenced by the performer's sexual
freedom, discovering his own bisexuality through the performance. The
suggestion made was that these performers are role models and influence
many teens-for good or bad. Unfortunately, the film did not pick up on
that thread of the story, as it continued on in its glitzy musical
style. The last serious thing it said, comes about in a conversation
between Arthur and Curt in a morbid neighborhood bar, where Curt
says:"We set out to change the world- but just changed ourselves."
Arthur says, "What's wrong with that?" Curt, "If you don't look at the
world." I guess something must have happened to the two performing
artists along the way, but it must have happened offscreen, because it
didn't happen onscreen.</P>
