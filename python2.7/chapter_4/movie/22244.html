<P>   When O.J. Simpson was found not guilty of murdering his
ex-wife and her friend, critics of the jury system and of
lawyers' tactics were quick to pounce on the verdict.  Given
the racial makeup of the jury and the defense team's alleged
playing of the race card, cynics and detractors in general
were quick to say that the decision was based not on the
evidence but on the willingness of minority jurors to free an
African-American simply because of his race.  What we
all know, though, is that the situation has almost always been
the reverse: jurors have been quick to find innocent people
guilty if the defendants were members of minority groups. 
During this film-packed Christmas period, moviegoers have
been treated to a story depicting a flagrant case of such
injustice by taking in Universal Studios' "The Hurricane," in
which Denzel Washington plays a prizefighter unjustly found
guilty of a murder and warehoused for a couple of decades
because of racial prejudice.  High-school students are still
assigned "To Kill a Mockingbird" in sophomore English class,
Harper Lee's powerful tale of a Southern lawyer who defends
a black man accused of rape.  (Kids lucky enough to catch a
revival of Robert Mulligan's 1962 movie starring Gregory
Peck and introducing Robert Duvall could get by without
reading the book.)</P>
<P>   Now, David Guterson's multi-layered, PEN/Faulkner prize-
winning novel, "Snow Falling on Cedars," has been adapted
to the screen by Scott Hicks, whose "Shine" proved that
director's mettle in examining the life of pianist David
Helfgott, who had been pushed to the edge by a demanding
father.  Using flashbacks to a greater extent than he did in
that 1996 film--in fact employing flashbacks within flashbacks,
overlapping dialogue, and a great emphasis on ambiance and
mood--Hicks is not as successful in translating this hugely
successful novel for a movie audience.  Pushing James
Newton Howard's moody score to the limit while zigzagging
back and forth to events in the lives of a newspaper reporter,
his Japanese love interest, a man accused of murdering his
best friend, and groups of Japanese forcibly evacuated to
wartime interment camps, Hicks has virtually abandoned all
aspects of linear storytelling to the service of fancy camera
work.  Though he does this in a far more skillful way than a
young film student, he nonetheless overemphasizes 
technique, thus blurring the tale's coherence and leaving the
audience flustered.  Though some scenes caught by
cinematographer Robert Richardson of snow falling on
the titled cedars in the Pacific Northwest are stunning--much
like images captured in movies like "The Sweet Hereafter"
and "The Ice Storm"--they cannot compensate for the oblique
narration of a compelling tale, one which highlights the nature
of American prejudice, the potential for inequity in our
criminal justice system, the value of courageous journalism,
and the heartbreak of a thwarted love affair.</P>
<P>   "Snow Falling on Cedars" is set in 1951, just six years after
the conclusion of World War 2, in the fictional town of San
Piedro near Puget Sound in the state of Washington.  Kazuo
Miyamoto (Rick Yune), a Japanese-American who served the
U.S. as a lieutenant in the war, is on trial for the murder of
his best friend, a white man.  Despite Miyamoto's service for
his country he is nonetheless hated by segments of the
community as are other Japanese living there, as bitter
memories of the war die slowly.  A journalist covering the
trial, Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke), is seated in the
balcony, but he is not an impartial spectator.  He is
torn between the liberal-humanist ideas of his journalist
father, Arthur (Sam Shepard), and the enmity he bears for
having lost an arm during the war and, perhaps more
important, having lost his girl friend, Hatsue Miyamoto (Youki
Kudoh), now married to the defendant.  </P>
<P>   A more straightforward telling of this story would have
served us better.  We did not need to wait until the final
segments of the movie to learn that Ishmael lost an arm while
fighting, nor does Hicks serve us well by showing the battle
scene in such a minimalist style that we can scarcely
appreciate that Ishmael was in the midst of raging combat. 
Nor can we be sure on which front Ishmael was fighting. 
While flashbacks are an appropriate device in a visual art like
the cinema--as well as in literature--we are treated to an
arbitrary repetition of the mechanism as Hicks takes us now
to Ishmael and Hatsue expressing teen love, then back to the
more recent past, then once again to their early childhood,
back again to the present day. Hicks does a better job when
he illustrates what the U.S. government did with many
Japanese-Americans--rounding them up and shipping them to
fenced-off camps for the duration of the war--a practice not
executed against German-Americans or Italian-Americans at
all.  (Alan Parker, who dazzled us just this month with
"Angela's Ashes," reminded us of one of our country's great
injustices in his 1990 film "Come See The Paradise," about a
hotheaded union organizer who is separated from his
Japanese-American wife after Pearl Harbor when she and her
family are sent to such a camp.)</P>
<P>   Twenty-nine year old Ethan Hawke, so dynamic in the film
"The Eighth Day," doesn't get a chance to do much other
than look glum and passive, with many of the love scenes
between him and Youki Kudoh played by a younger version
of his character (Reeve Carney), but Youki Kudoh turns in a
fine performance as the conflicted love object ordered by her
mother--like the Rebeka Johnson character, Sylvia, in "Liberty
Heights" to marry her own kind.  Max von Sydow is the
scene-stealer, though, as the defendant's gentle attorney
Nels Gudmundsson, who tells the jury that since he is
virtually looking death in the face, he can prize from long
experience the need for justice.  While all loose ends are
ultimately tied up--Ishmael learning that he must hold on to
his father's principles while letting go of his great love--"Snow
Falling on Cedars" falls victim to overly pretentious film
technique.</P>
