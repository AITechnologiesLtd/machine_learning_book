<P>     It's always good around Halloween to have one really bad horror 
movie to look forward to.  Alas, this year's lone October horror 
release, THINNER, falls considerably short of the level of awfulness 
established by last year's HALLOWEEN 6.  While this latest adaptation of 
a Stephen King novel doesn't approach "good" film making, it's at least 
watchable (if just barely) -- a quality that no one would ascribe to the 
most recent chapter of the unbearably moronic Michael Myers saga.</P>
<P>     There are two kinds of movies based on Stephen King stories -- the 
dramas (STAND BY ME, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION) and the horrors (PET 
SEMATARY, THE MANGLER).  In general, the former are quite good while the 
latter are terrible.  So, since THINNER falls somewhere between genres, 
it's fitting that the film's quality is also somewhere in the middle.  
THINNER is a rather shallow and unsatisfactory examination of some 
potentially-worthwhile themes and ideas.  Equally unfortunately, it's 
not at all scary.  </P>
<P>     The film opens in Fairview, Connecticut, where attorney Billy 
Halleck (Robert John Burke) is the toast of his law firm, having just 
won the acquittal of mobster Richie Ginelli (Joe Mantegna, sporting a 
chic beard).  On the personal front, however, Billy is having far less 
success in his war against weight.  He's tipping the scales at 300 
pounds, and his habit of sneaking snacks is defeating his latest diet.  
His wife, Heidi (Lucinda Jenny), and daughter, Linda (Joy Lenz), despair 
of him ever losing the undesirable mass, and they're seriously concerned 
about his health.</P>
<P>     Then, one night, while Billy is driving through town, he 
accidentally hits and kills a gypsy woman.  With the connivance a couple 
of friends -- a cop and a judge -- Billy escapes without being charged.  
But the dead woman's father, the gypsy king Tadzu Lempke (Michael 
Constantine), curses Billy to become thinner.  Suddenly, he's losing 
weight at the rate of three pounds a day.  For a while, this is a boon, 
but, as his physique goes from bulky to normal to emaciated, he becomes 
panicky, crying out, "I'm being erased!" (Maybe he should consult with 
Arnold Schwarzenegger, star of this summer's ERASER.)  And, as his body 
wastes away, his life begins to collapse.  Soon, his wife is trying to 
have him committed, and Billy is forced to enlist Richie's help in 
delivering a curse of his own upon the gypsies.</P>
<P>     THINNER could have been an opportunity to examine the ethics of a 
slick lawyer who refuses to accept responsibility for his actions.  
Billy successfully defends guilty clients and uses friendships to escape 
manslaughter charges, thinking that nothing can touch him.  But justice 
is waiting, although it has nothing to do with the law.  Unfortunately, 
questions of morality are of secondary importance to a film that 
emphasizes its DEATH WISH aspects.  The most energetic parts of THINNER 
are those that focus on Billy's revenge, and this is no accident.  </P>
<P>     The makeup that transforms 175-pound Robert John Burke into his 
300-pound character is embarrassingly unconvincing, especially in the 
wake of the much better job done to expand Eddie Murphy's waistline in 
THE NUTTY PROFESSOR.  It looks like Burke is wearing latex strips on his 
face and rubber padding under his clothing, which, of course, is exactly 
what he's doing.  For that matter, the prosthetics on Michael 
Constantine and several other actors don't look all that impressive, 
either.  </P>
<P>     On top of its other problems, THINNER is too long.  There's not 
enough story here for a forty-five minute motion picture, not to mention 
something twice that length.  As a result, there's a lot of pointless 
running around, a protracted dream sequence, and some meaningless 
"character building" scenes that don't build anything.  The movie drags 
through the middle part, only jumping to life when Joe Mantegna's 
character comes on the scene and starts getting violent.  On the whole, 
though, a slimmer running time, not to mention an astute script, would 
have made THINNER go down a lot more smoothly.</P>
