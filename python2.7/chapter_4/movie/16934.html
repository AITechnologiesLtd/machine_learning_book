<P>Who could have possibly predicted that the antichrist director who all 
but buried the "Batman" franchise with the last two installments, Joel 
Schumacher, could strike back triumphantly and almost fully redeem 
himself with "8mm," which is perhaps his best film to date. Of course, 
Schumacher has been good before (1990's "Flatliners," 1993's "Falling 
Down," 1996's "A Time to Kill"), but nothing he has made has quite been 
this dark, intelligent, and disturbing, as it delves deeply into the 
world of S&M, porn, and the infamous myth of snuff films.</P>
<P>Every time Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage), a surveillance expert, comes home 
to his loving wife, Amy (Catherine Keener), and baby girl, it seems that 
he always has to leave again to carry out another job. Amy cares for 
him, and knows that the large amount of money he makes is going to help 
them out a great deal, and as their baby's college money, but hates when 
he leaves them alone. At the start of "8mm," Tom is hired by the 
recently widowed, elderly Mrs. Christian (Myra Carter), after she finds 
a ghastly Super-8 snuff film in her husband's safe that allegedly shows 
a solemn teenage girl being brutally murdered by a large man dressed in 
black leathered S&M garb. "I want to know if this atrocity is true," 
Mrs. Christian says, and offering him an enormous sum of money, Tom, who 
is equally upset and outraged at what is on the film, leaves his family 
again to go in search of the girl on the film, and to find out if she 
was actually killed, or if it was staged. The first thing Tom discovers 
is that the brand of film it was made on has been out of manufacturing 
since 1992, and while searching through the millions of missing persons 
reports at the police station, Tom, to his amazement, finds the 
information about the girl, named Mary Ann. This revelation leads him to 
the girl's lonely, depressed mother (Amy Morton), and after finding Mary 
Ann's hidden diary in which she last wrote to her mother about running 
away and going to Hollywood, Tom sets off to L.A. and into the world of 
adult films, where he meets Max California (Joaquin Phoenix), a helpful, 
smarter-than-expected young man who works at one of the porno shops and 
offers to help him out.</P>
<P>Written by Andrew Kevin Walker (who wrote the equally downbeat "Se7en"), 
it is rare for a decidedly big-budget mainstream film to have the 
courage to delve deeply and thoughtfully into such risky and unsettling 
territory, but that is exactly what "8mm" does. There is no doubt many 
people who will be completely turned off by this superb, unconventional 
motion picture, and that it actually recieved an R-rating by the usually 
strict MPAA is particularly surprising. There isn't much in the way of 
gore, but the movie is very, very violent, and at times is almost too
 difficult to take because of the somber, controversial subject matter.</P>
<P>"8mm" is probably the smartest film I have seen that deals with the sick 
nature of S&M and snuff, and although at times graphic, director 
Schumacher thankfully does not exploit the goings-on, but instead, is 
wise to deal with it in a ruminant manner, unveiling the very 
frightening and unstable minds of certain people's psyche. Adding 
another thought-provoking layer to the story involves the central 
character of Tom who is a caring family man at the start, but as he 
becomes involved more and more in this "other" shady world, ultimately 
finds himself being pushed to the limit, even having to contemplate 
murder himself, and somewhat unsure if he can ever return to the life he 
once knew.</P>
<P>There is one scene, in particular, in "8mm" that must rank as one of the 
most nail-bitingly suspenseful film moments in recent memory, a 
seemingly endless and scary scene played exclusively to the repetitive, 
atmospheric sound of a record player's hand repeatedly running over the 
rough grooves at the end of a record. Director Schumacher milks this 
sequence for all its worth, as he does on several other occassions, and 
thus helps to make "8mm" all the more effective and tense. Also helping 
immeasurably is the odd, marvelously orchestrated music score by Mychael 
Danna. Strangely enough, while watching the film, due to where certain 
things take place, it actually reminded me off watching an actual snuff 
movie, and I have unfortunately seen one, a feature film entitled 
"Snuff" from the 1970s that was banned in several countries and depicted 
a woman being butchered in the dispicable final reel (this "murder" was 
later decided to be a fake, albeit realistic, reenactment). </P>
<P>The performances are all rather memorable, with Nicolas Cage once again 
acting as the likable, if flawed, character that we follow throughout. 
Also notable are Phoenix, in a role that is easily more satisfying and 
fully-developed than some of his recent ventures, such as in "U-Turn" 
and "Clay Pigeons;" James Gandolfini as a seedy porn producer; and Amy 
Morton, who has a touching turn as the victim's grieving mother. 
Catherine Keener, outstanding in all of her independent film, such as 
1996's "Walking and Talking," 1998's "The Real Blonde," and 1998's "Your 
Friends & Neighbors," helps to breathe unexpected life into the 
relatively thankless role of Tom's wife (although she is given a few 
moving moments in the latter section).</P>
<P>As far as I am concerned, "8mm" has only one noticable flaw and that is 
the slightly disappointing climax set in a cemetary during a rain storm. 
By choosing to go this route, the film suddenly moves into cliched 
thriller territory, but is preserved, thanks to the perfect concluding 
scenes that are nothing short of satisfying. Not only is "8mm" 
Schumacher's best film, but it is Cage's most assured work since his 
Oscar-winning role in "Leaving Las Vegas," and the screenplay by Walker 
is brave and astute, turning what could have been a cheap-thrills freak 
show into what will most likely go down as one of the most daring and 
attentive films of the year.</P>
