 20th Century Fox
 Director:  Mark Tarlov
 Writer:  Judith Roberts
 Cast: Sarah Michelle Gellar, Sean Patrick Flanery, Patricia
Clarkson, Dylan Baker, Christopher Durang, Larry Gillard</P>
<P>   One of the running gags in this movie is that men
think of sex 278 times a day...that you can tell when a
gentleman in contemplating its joys when he tightens his belt
or puts his hands in his pockets.  While no one is taking a
guess on the figure attributable to women, I'd cut the digits in
half and say that people think of food 139 times a day and
sex the remainder.  We don't wonder that sex has been the
favorite theme of theater and film since Agamemnon's fooling
around cost him his life and Medea's husband Jason's
adulteries cost him his children.  But perhaps only one out of
forty movies shows people enjoying food.  They may be
eating to create busywork at the director's insistence, but
centering a film around a meal is as rare as displaying actors
in the bathroom.</P>
<P>   We're grateful, then, that "Simply Irresistible" has come
along, a paean to great food, a film that equates fine dining
with sexual ecstasy.  In no way, though, is Mark Tarlov's
work in the same class as the 1966 stroke of genius, "Big
Night," which substitutes Stanley Tucci for Sarah Michelle
Gellar as that film's gourmet cook.  While "Simply Irresistible"
is on the right track, exchanging flotation and magic for the
earthier tones of "Big Night," the film is simply too repetitious,
featuring two actors who simply do not make chemistry
together and, in the case of Ms. Gellar a nasal voice that is
the equivalent of fingernails making their way up a
blackboard.</P>
<P>   Sorcery is in the air from the earliest scene, as Christopher
Durang plays Cupid in the guise of a seller of crabs and a
taxi driver.  He starts the sparks flying, assuring a meeting
between Amanda (Gellar) and a man who will become her
gentleman caller, Tom (Sean Patrick Flanery).  As with
virtually every romantic comedy, the two must be made to
split up each time they get together.  In "Simply Irresistible"
the fear of vulnerability takes the place of geographical
estrangement: Tom, who is opening a large, elaborate
restaurant uptown from Amanda's SoHo eatery, has worked
his dating problems out on his computer and has discovered
that he loses every prospective partner the fourth time out. 
He is as determined to avoid the mistake with Amanda as
Amanda is bent on keeping his attention.</P>
<P>   Gellar, who made a name for herself as Buffy the Vampire
Slayer on TV, comes across like an 18-year-old kid to
Flanery's urbane, alpha-male restaurateur.  As Amanda,
Gellar plays a chef whose long-established restaurant is
about to go under simply because she cannot cook, but
under the spell of a crab that Cupid has left in her kitchen,
she has fallen in love.  Her cooking suddenly takes on
inspirational wizardry.  She makes caramel eclairs that gives
those who eat them unadulterated euphoria, while her Crabs
Napoleon bring customers in by the score.  When she dances
with Tom, the floor takes on the qualities of a large ballroom
with mirrors, filling with fog that literally transports the lovers
to the ceiling.  Is this what you were like when you first fell in
love?</P>
<P>    Opening shortly before Valentine's Day, "Simply
Irresistible" is a date movie that probably seeks a twenty-
something audience.  The romance is old-fashioned, the sort
that market researchers  say is craved by youth now tuning
out the edgy, satiric comedies about love.  Its principal
attractions are the side roles, particularly Larry Gilliard Jr. as
Amanda assistant chef Nolan, who is easily the most
amusing fellow in this slight work, while Dylan Baker, so vivid
in Todd Solondz's "Happiness," is foolish to the point of
embarrassment.  For the most part, this eclair is no "Like
Water for Chocolate."</P>
