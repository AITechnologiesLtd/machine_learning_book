<P>"To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance."</P>
<P>Starring Rupert Everett, Julianne Moore, Jeremy Northam, Cate Blanchett,
Minnie Driver Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Although Rupert Everett has been acting since the early 80's, he crawled
out of the woodwork just in 1997 with his shoulda-been-Oscar-nominated
turn as Julia Roberts' gay editor in My Best Friend's Wedding. Now, he's
finally gotten his long-deserved leading role in An Ideal Husband,
director Oliver Parker's light n' fluffy adaptation of Oscar Wilde's
play. It's a delightfully good romantic comedy about love, intrigue,
blackmail and of course marriage.</P>
<P>Jeremy Northam, last seen in David Mamet's brilliant The Winslow Boy
(also a period piece) stars as Lord Robert Chiltern, a respected and
wealthy politician whose public life is threatened when he is
blackmailed by an old acquaintance. Chiltern has been preparing a report
to the parliament regarding a certain canal project, and it was his
every intention to condemn it. However, Mrs. Laura Chevely has quite a
tidy sum invested in the project and she threatens to reveal the corrupt
way Chiltern attained his wealth (and has a document to prove it) unless
he speaks favorably of the project.</P>
<P>Lord Arthur Gorring (Everett, the star of the show) is a thirty-six year
old bachelor (unthinkable in the late 19th century) who speaks in
aphorisms and is fond of gems such as "I love to talk about nothing.
It's the only thing I know anything about." He is also Chiltern's good
friend and after Chiltern confides in him, he wants to help. When
Chiltern tells his wife (Cate Blanchett) the truth about his riches she
demands that he leave immediately. Everett then sets up a way for the
husband and wife to get back together: he plans to have both of them in
his house in rooms directly next to each other with neither of them
knowing where the other is. He then plans to talk to Chiltern and have
him say that he regrets what he has done and is deeply apologetic for it
so that his wife can hear it from the next room. The plan backfires when
Gorring's butler mixes up Chevely and Chiltern's wife, sending the
latter away while putting Chevely in the next room, forcing Chiltern to
think that Gorring and Chevely are having an affair.</P>
<P>An Ideal Husband is an entertaining, light-as-a-feather production, as
funny as it is affecting. There is a wicked, knowing charm emanating
from the star-studded cast. Sometimes Parker's movie seems like a
showcase for these actors and actresses, but I didn't mind. If stars can
act well in a film with the intention of exhibiting their talents, then
more power to them.</P>
<P>Indeed, this peculiar comedy owes much to its gloriously gifted roster
of performers. Rupert Everett again deserves Oscar attention; he is
absolutely delightful as London's most eligible bachelor, sly and suave
yet sympathetic at the same time. Jeremy Northam is just as good: even
though he doesn't get too many comedic scenes, his performance is quite
impressive. The roles given to Minnie Driver and Cate Blanchett aren't
particularly showy, but both of them being fantastic actresses, they
make the best of it. But the real gem is Julianne Moore as the sneaky
blackmailer. Enigmatic and often hilarious, an Oscar nomination is in
order for her turn here.</P>
<P>The thematic significance of An Ideal Husband is not constantly apparent
nor is it important to enjoy this picture. I liked it because of its
charm, because of its comedy and because of its performances and
wouldn't dream of complaining about lack of particularly deep substance.
The film has more than enough wit to make up for any such deficiency.</P>
<P>This isn't as good as films come, but it's a welcome antidote to a
summer of mediocre big-budget timewasters. This won't be a doorbuster,
but that's too bad because it has more laughs than Big Daddy and Wild
Wild West combined. Typical Hollywood irony at hand.
