<P> We've seen lost of black comedies about gangsters in resent years.
Films such as "2 Days in the Valley",
"Grosse Point Blank", and the film that started it all "Pulp Fiction".
Now we have a new entry in the genre, with Chi-Kirk Wong's humorous send
up "The Big Hit". While the film is far from perfect, it is an enjoyable
exercise in escapism, with tongue firmly in cheek.
 The film opens with Vinnie (Antonio Sabato Jr.) dropping off two bags
of body parts for Melvin Surley (Mark Wahlberg) to dispose of as a
favor. The comedic nature of the film is set up immediately as when
dragging the bags from his car into his bathroom, Melvin complains about
the cheep plastic, which causes blood to leak out onto his driveway.
Melvin lives in a suburban neighborhood, where everyone mows his or her
lawns at the same time. His lover is Chantel (Lela Rochon) who is
constantly whining about money, which Melvin is too happy to supply her.
However, the real surprise is Melvin's fiancie Pam (played with
wonderful glee by Christina Applegate). A Jewish American Princess of
the highest order who is more concerned with her outward appearance and
the impressions of others as to be almost void of her own personality.
Melvin is a man with a distinct problem; he is the complete antithesis
of his surname.
 Melvin is a hit man by profession. But he is so concerned with being
liked that he submits to his friends and co-workers at every turn. After
going on a job, where he does all of the killing while his associates
stand by drinking coffee, Melvin gives up his payment after being made
to feel guilty by Cisco (Lou Diamond Phillips). Their employer, Paris is
a strong man with no determined business affiliation. Moreover, for once
it's doesn't matter.
 The plot takes a turn when Cisco devises a plan for a quick payoff,
kidnapping the daughter of rich Japanese industrialist Jiro Nishi (Sab
Shimono). Unfortunately, Jiro is now bankrupt, having blown his fortunes
on an ill-advised Motion Picture investment, which he also directed and
stared in (a marvelously inventive literal translation of "Taste My
Golden Spray"). Well the kidnapping of Keiko Nishi (China Chow) takes
place. Unfortunately, it turns out that Paris is the girl's godfather,
and he demands revenge. He orders Cisco to find the kidnapper and kill
him. In an effort to save his self, Cisco fingers Melvin.
 Now the plot as stated is not much of a stretch. Nevertheless, the
character writing and situations developed within the plot are so
wonderfully quirky and absurd that they are hilariously charming. "The
Big Hit" is a rarity for an action film, in that its simple plot is just
a means to set up wonderfully comedic character interplay.
 One surprising and welcome performance comes from Elliott Gould as Mort
Schulman, Pam's Father. Mr. Gould brings this little part to such
wonderful life as to be one of the many character highlights of the
film. In fact Mort Schulman could almost be an aged version of Gould's
character Alfred Chamberlain from Alan Arkin's film "Little Murders"
(1971).  Lainie Kazan as Mrs. Schulman is hilariously stereotypical. She
is the ultimate Jewish matron. "The Big Hit" is sure to cause some
concerns with the PC watchdog group. Lou Diamond Phillips rages as
Cisco, eating scenery with more ravenous energy than Peter Sellers could
in his prime. This is not what you would call a great performance.
However, it is a performance of such high satirical tenor that you
cannot help but either be amused or repulsed. Christina Applegate shows
a wonderful sense of timing, both verbally and physically in the film.
Her character of Pam is independent but soon shows that her mother holds
much more sway over her that she is willing to admit.
 This brings us to Mark Wahlberg. His Melvin is a variation on Jim
Carrey's character from "The Mask". A complete milquetoast until called
upon to act violently. While this performance will not go down as one of
his best, ('Boogie Nights' still holds that distinction), Mr. Wahlberg
shows a sweetness and comic flair that up until now was unseen. His
scenes with China Chow (as kidnapped Keiko Nishi) are hilarious,
especially a scene in which, handcuffed together, she helps Melvin
prepare a Kosher Chicken dinner for his future in-laws. As they marinate
and stuff the bird, the erotic electricity becomes so comical as to be
disgusting.
 Director Chi-Kirk Wong has created a marvelously structured comedy/
action film. His knowing references to other Honk Kong films may be lost
on most viewers, but for those who are familiar; these asides are
plentiful and joyously reverent. Director Wong has made a name for
himself as being one of Hong Kong's most notable stylists of action
films. He guided Jackie Chan through one of his best performances in
"Crime Story" and created one of cinema's best police dramas in "Rock
'n' Roll Cop". While there are surly others who can direct an action
scene, we have not witnessed a combination of character and action this
well tuned since John Woo's "The Killer".
 "The Big Hit", while not a great film, is a fine piece of
entertainment.
On a scale of ***** "The Big Hit" rates ***.  It is a surprising dark
comedy with some of the best action moments since John Woo's "Face Off",
and moments of laugh out loud absurdity.</P>
