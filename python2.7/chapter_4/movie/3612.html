<P>     There are essentially two ways to do a satire:  go for all-out 
zaniness with an overload of one-liners and sight gags (a la AIRPLANE), 
or try for something more subtle.  This second tactic, if used 
correctly, is almost always more scathing.  Robert Altman employed it 
for THE PLAYER, which is pretty much regarded as the ultimate skewering 
of Hollywood.  With SEARCH AND DESTROY, director David Salle tries 
unsuccessfully for something similar.  Even at its most effective, this 
film comes across as a pale imitation of far better pictures. </P>
<P>     SEARCH AND DESTROY opens by introducing us to Martin Mirkheim 
(Griffin Dunne), a slimy "entrepreneur" who finds himself $147,956 in 
debt to the IRS (exclusive of interest and penalties).  To solve his 
financial woes, he decides to make a movie based on a book called DANIEL 
STRONG:  AN ADVENTURE STORY, written by one of Martin's heroes, cable 
access pop psychologist Dr. Luthor Waxling (Dennis Hopper).  However, to 
get the rights to the book, Martin must first come up with several 
hundred thousand dollars in cash.  So, with his assistant Marie (played 
with wide-eyed vivacity by Illeana Douglas) in tow, Martin heads for New 
York City.  Once there, he goes to the offices of a supposed drug dealer 
named Kim (Christopher Walken), in hopes of raising the necessary money.  
Much to Martin's surprise, disappointment, and embarrassment, Kim turns 
out to be a legitimate businessman, but that doesn't mean he might not 
be willing to arrange a little drug deal--just to help out a friend.   </P>
<P>     Parts of this film seem a little too reminiscent of THE BIG PICTURE 
and NAKED IN NEW YORK, movies which, like this one, deal with the 
sacrifices and tribulations of getting a motion picture made.  The 
difference here is that, unlike the protagonists of PICTURE and NAKED, 
Martin isn't concerned about protecting the integrity of his script.  
Actually, he could care less about the integrity of anything, as long as 
he gets the money. </P>
<P>     Some of the core ideas in SEARCH AND DESTROY have potential.  Take, 
for example, the premise of approaching a supposed gangster who's not a 
gangster but who's willing to try being one.  The film has fun with 
this, at least to start with, chiefly because of wonderful performances 
by Christopher Walken (as Kim, a man determined to "do it with passion") 
and John Turturro (as a profanity-spewing small-time hood with terrible 
taste in wigs and clothes).  Eventually, however, this element of the 
plot descends into a series of tedious episodes punctuated by moments of 
extreme violence.  This is an example of how something that starts out 
fresh can end up boring and derivative. </P>
<P>     There are a number of enjoyable, sometimes hilarious moments in 
SEARCH AND DESTROY, but the framework joining them doesn't work 
particularly well.  This is a case when the whole is vastly inferior to 
its parts.  The focus is too diffuse, attempting to satirize everything 
from '80s greed and motivational TV programs to motion picture making.  
SEARCH AND DESTROY is very much hit-and-miss, and might have been less 
grating had it done more of the former and less of the latter. </P>
