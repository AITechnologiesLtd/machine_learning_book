<PRE>"Stigmata" -- Not Worth the Sacrifice
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>My friends will tell you that I'm not very religious.  I'm not an avid
churchgoer, and I'm sure that there is much that I will have to atone
for when I am finally reviewed for entry at the Pearly Gates.  Saint
Peter will probably ask me how much I know about the teachings of
Jesus, to which my answer will undoubtedly disappoint the heavenly
gatekeeper.  But despite my lack of faith, I DO know that the
scriptwriters of `Stigmata' will be taking the express elevator to that
other place because this film, based deeply on some Christian
underpinnings, recklessly throws away any semblance of theology out the
window.</P>
<P>The first such absurd example involves some rosary beads that contain a
supernatural spirit.  Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette) receives this
as a gift from Mom who bought it on the streets of a small Brazilian
town.  Frankie lives a normal stress-free life comprised of days
piercing nipples at her beauty salon and nights hanging out with her
girlfriends at the local clubs.  But soon after the receipt of her
gift, horrifying and unexplainable phenomenon begins to happen.  First,
holes mysteriously appear in her wrists as if something had driven a
stake through it.  She is rushed to the hospital where the doctors
think that she is suicidal.  A few days go by and some unseen force
severely lashes her back.  The doctors have no rational explanation. 
These events catch the attention of the Vatican who dispatches Father
Andrew (Gabriel Byrne) to investigate.  His sole purpose is to disprove
so-called miracles.  He is extremely skeptical about Frankie because
she is a self-professed atheist.  However, when the next miracle occurs
(her forehead is mysteriously slashed), he tells her of the Stigmata.</P>
<P>Father Andrew explains that experiencing the Stigmata is like a
miraculous gift from God.  Jesus suffered these exact same wounds. 
There were five wounds in all, including the staking of the feet and a
spear through the body.  `But Jesus died,' Frankie blurts out.  `Can I
give these gifts back,' she asks?  I would think that having such a
gift, though obviously painful, would be glorious and inspiring.  But
the movie portrays this as some sort of dark, demonic possession. 
Frankie (or actually the spirit that possesses her) begins to madly
etch out incomprehensible symbols and speak in a deep satanic voice. 
Both of these, we are told, are Aramaic, a long-forgotten dialect used
in the time of Jesus.  What is she writing?  What is she saying?  Are
these the actual words of Christ?</P>
<P>At this point, a new plot develops that takes this film in a completely
new direction.  Upon learning of this new development, the Vatican
leaders (headed by Jonathan Pryce) tell Father Andrew to conclude his
investigation immediately.  They are afraid of something and take it
into their own hands to address the issue of Frankie's miracles. 
Father Andrew, however, is determined to know the truth.  Think X-Files
where the enemy is the Vatican.</P>
<P>Does any of this make sense?  Well, if you were confused about religion
before, this can only add fuel to the fire.  It thinks that rosary
beads can contain spirits, it confuses miracles with possession, and it
portrays the Vatican as the instrument of an ongoing conspiracy.  I
also found this movie irritating in many ways.  I especially disliked
the sequences when she experienced Stigmata, which I though was
needlessly bloody and overly dramatic.  I also didn't care for the
accompanying sound effects which were grating and used exaggerated
noises (honking of horns, fluttering of wings) to try to add tension. 
There are some good ideas at work here including very nice
cinematography and grounding Frankie in a blue-collar atmosphere to
show that miracles can happen to the most common of folk.  But her role
is simply impossible and this film doesn't convince us that it is a
drama or a thriller or anything else other than something that is
masquerading as a horror film.</P>
