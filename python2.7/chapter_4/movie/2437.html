<P>     SUGAR HILL, a moody, atmospheric tale of violence and drugs on the
streets of modern-day Harlem, moves along too slowly for its own good.
While the story doesn't score points for originality, the themes
addressed are important and immediate, and ultimately it's a failure in
execution that keeps this film from joining the ranks of a number of
recent, memorable pictures chronicling life on the streets and in the
ghettos.</P>
<P>     Romillo Skuggs (Wesley Snipes) and his older brother Ray (Michael
Wright) grew up in Harlem with junkies for a mother and father.  At an
early age, the boys began working for one of the local bosses, Gus (Abe
Vigoda).  As the years went by, their influence and power expanded,
until they have become the premier drug dealers in the neighborhood,
wielding power to be reckoned with.  But Romillo is becoming
disillusioned with his life of crime, and is desperately seeking a way
out, even as Ray tries to keep the "team" together.  Things get more
complicated as another player (Ernie Hudson) enters the local drug
game, and the killings that start threaten to ignite into a full-scale
street war.</P>
<P>     With a brooding jazz score and dark, gloomy cinematography that
highlights shadows, SUGAR HILL is a masterpiece of atmosphere.  It has
a stylish feel that lends a romanticized aura to its depiction of
gangsters and violence.  This film does not have the punch-in-the-guts
realism of a BOYZ 'N THE HOOD or a MENACE II SOCIETY, nor does it have
the quality or scope of THE GODFATHER.  The 40s aura allows us to keep
all but the most brutal moments of SUGAR HILL at arm's length.</P>
<P>     The tale of a high-ranking criminal trying to go straight has been
the central focus of numerous movies.  If done right, it can be a
fascinating topic.  SUGAR HILL, however, having decided on the premise,
can't figure out how to execute it.  The script meanders for nearly two
hours, with numerous scenes dragging on for too long.  There is rarely
any tension or energy--of either the dramatic or action-oriented
variety.</P>
<P>     Presumably, one of the reasons for the uneven, plodding tone is to
allow for character development.  In that, the filmmakers have
underestimated their first half-hour.  A quarter of the way into the
film, Romillo and Ray are already fully fleshed out.  The additional
talky scenes add little to the relationship or the individuals, and
Romillo's constant repetition of the refrain "I've got to get out of
here" becomes tedious.</P>
<P>     Wesley Snipes, who appears capable of playing almost any sort of
character, from action hero to paraplegic, turns in another capable
performance as Romillo.  This is certainly not his best role, but the
actor understands the character whose identity he has taken on, and
manages to present a man capable of capturing the audience's sympathy
without compromising the essence of his personality.</P>
<P>     The weak link in the film may be Michael Wright, who plays Ray.
Only occasionally convincing, Mr. Wright picks one of the most
inopportune moments to act beyond the boundaries of believability:  the
all-important climactic moment.  This rather heavy-handed scene had the
misfortune of receiving a smattering of unintentional laughter within
the darkened confines of the theater where I viewed the film.</P>
<P>     The moral of SUGAR HILL is "don't do drugs," and this message is
presented in an obvious and uninspired manner.  The preachiness becomes
a little irritating, whether in words (Mr. Snipes' opening voiceover)
or in deeds (every act of drug use leads to unpleasant
consequences--often death).</P>
<P>     Still, this picture's most obvious flaw has nothing to do with its
sermonizing.  The problem lies instead with its somniferous pacing.
SUGAR HILL moves with all the speed of molasses.</P>
