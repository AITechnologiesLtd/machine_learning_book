<P>     Viewing BROTHER OF SLEEP is the cinematic equivalent of watching a 
train wreck.  It's definitely not a pleasant experience, but there's 
such a concentration of intense tragedy and drama that it's impossible 
to look away.  BROTHER OF SLEEP is wrenching, depressing, and often 
unpleasant, and there are plenty of narrative flaws, but the overall 
experience lies within the scope of what one expects from a well-made 
motion picture.</P>
<P>     The movie takes place around 1800 in the village of Eschberg, a 
small community nestled in the Bavarian Alps, 5500 feet above sea level.  
The main character, Elias Alder (Andre Eisermann), the illegitimate son 
of the local priest, is called the "Devil's son" because of his 
unnatural mental powers and amazing musical talent.  In the company of 
his lone friend, Peter (Ben Becker), Elias spends his days practicing 
his music on the church organ.  Meanwhile, he has fallen in love with 
Peter's younger sister, Elsbeth (Dana Vavrova), who is entranced by him, 
but promised to another.  The romantic situation becomes more complex 
(and strays into melodrama) when Elias refuses to commit to a 
relationship with Elsbeth, and Peter's homosexual passion for Elias 
causes him to take decisive action.</P>
<P>     Director Joseph Vilsmaier, who made the memorable epic STALINGRAD, 
has chosen to adapt Robert Schneider's novel in an artistic manner that 
borders on excessive.  BROTHER OF SLEEP is filled with images -- some 
breathtaking (like the opening sequence looking down on the Alps) and 
some nightmarish (like when Elias starts hearing voices and music in his 
head).  Despite its stern stance against organized religion (the 
hypocrisy of which gets skewered at every opportunity), the film 
endorses spirituality, and, as a result, there's a strange, almost-
mystical quality to the tone.  There are times when the manner in which 
BROTHER OF SLEEP has been produced interferes with the story it's 
telling.</P>
<P>     Two threads are woven throughout the whole of BROTHER OF SLEEP's 
tapestry -- the romantic triangle featuring Elias, Elsbeth, and Peter, 
and Elias' pursuit of his "natural-born genius" for music.  Frustrated 
love for Elsbeth and the unfulfilled need to release his innate talent 
fuel a powerful scene where Elias plays an organ with such inspired 
abandon that one of his listeners cries out, "The heavens have opened!"  
Even though the music itself isn't that convincing, the raw passion is, 
making this one of those transcendent scenes that justifies a trip to 
theater for BROTHER OF SLEEP.</P>
<P>     While the romance works, it's not as involving as it could be.  The 
distance between the audience and the characters keeps us from caring 
deeply about how things are resolved.  There are times when we can feel 
the lonely gulf separating Elsbeth and Elias, but that's not always the 
case.  Unlike JUDE, which plunges us into the heart of a doomed love 
affair and keeps us there, BROTHER OF SLEEP's stylistic flourishes don't 
foster the kind of intimacy necessary to fashion an equally wrenching 
storyline.</P>
<P>     Vilsmaier's view of Eschberg is bleak and colorless, allowing the 
town's physical appearance to match its spiritual state.  Except for a 
few key sequences when Elias' music transforms everything around him, 
BROTHER OF SLEEP is drenched in grays, browns, and other earthy hues.  
It always seems to be raining or snowing, and the ground is a like a sea 
of mud and slush.  Everyone is realistically filthy, with dirt on their 
skin, under their nails, and in their hair.  This isn't a film for those 
who want their movie characters to be neat and presentable.</P>
<P>     Of the trio of main actors, Dana Vavrova (who is the director's 
wife) is the only one who captivates.  Elsbeth is easily the most 
sympathetic person in the movie, even after she's largely out of the 
action.  Andre Eisermann plays Elias as slightly detached and distracted 
-- someone who lives on a different plane than everyone around him. Ben 
Becker effectively conveys Peter's intense jealousy, although the guilt 
he later develops isn't as believable. </P>
<P>     There are times when BROTHER OF SLEEP's narrative is choppy, but 
this does little to blunt the impact of the key themes.  And, although 
Vilsmaier's surreal style may detract as much from the film as it adds, 
much of the most provocative material comes through unscathed, including 
the central metaphysical conflict between the demands of genius and the 
desires of the body.  BROTHER OF SLEEP isn't the kind of movie to seek 
as a cure for depression, but, for those looking for a downbeat 
excursion into artistic storytelling, this film offers a solid example.</P>
