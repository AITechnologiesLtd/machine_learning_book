<PRE>Mulan (G) **** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Although it undoubtedly upset Disney executives, the disappointing
domestic box office performance of last year's _Hercules_ was probably the
best thing to happen to the Mouse's animation house.  While it was a light,
expertly crafted, and highly enjoyable trifle, it was just that, a trifle,
lacking the gravity that was a crucial ingredient of the studio's biggest
financial (_The_Lion_King_) and artistic (_Beauty_and_the_Beast_,
_The_Hunchback_of_Notre_Dame_) successes.  Seemingly galvanized by that
humbling wakeup call, Disney's tried-and-true blend of populist instincts
and weightier interests is back in full force and top form in _Mulan_.</P>
<P>In its current animation renaissance, Disney has proven to be better
suited to handling female protagonists (Belle, Ariel, Pocahontas) than male
ones (Aladdin and Hercules were varying degrees of milquetoast), and the
title character of Fa Mulan (spoken by Ming-Na Wen, sung by Lea Salonga) is
no exception.  Crippled in their ongoing war with the Huns, the shorthanded
Imperial Chinese army requires that one male from each family join the
military cause.  The only male in the Fa family is Mulan's father (Soon-Tek
Oh), and, despite his advanced age and bad leg, he valiantly agrees to
enlist.  Determined to save her father from what is certain death and
maintain honor in the family, Mulan, in a sequence of stunning visual and
emotional power, cuts her hair, dons battle armor, and joins the army with
her father's summons as the male Ping.</P>
<P>Although all of Disney's recent heroines have been strong feminist role
models, none have been quite as proactive as Mulan.  As can be expected,
she initially cannot keep up with the guys in basic training, but she
manages to make her every man's equal, if not superior, through her sheer
will and determination.  Mulan's transformation is highly reminiscent of
Demi Moore's in last year's Disney drama _G.I._Jane_, but _Mulan_ oneups
that film's hour-long toughening process by efficiently covering the same
ground during a single, rousing musical number, "I'll Make a Man Out of
You," sung by army captain Shang (spoken by B.D. Wong, sung by, yes, Donny
Osmond).  _Mulan_ also out-G.I.'s _Jane_ by having its heroine rely mostly
on wits, rather than brawn, in combat; while she has a high kick that
rivals the best of them, it's her quick-thinking brain that proves to be
most formidable.</P>
<P>The main thrust of the story sounds rather serious, but this is a Disney
film, after all, and it would not be complete without the requisite comic
relief, here in the form of the scrawny dragon Mushu (Eddie Murphy), who is
Mulan's self-appointed guardian.  A hilarious, jive-talking Murphy would
appear to be an out of place in this largely earnest tale, but Mushu is
more seamlessly integrated into the story than the seemingly grafted-on
comic relief in the two most serious Disney efforts, _Hunchback_ and
_Pocahontas_.  _Hunchback_  and _Pocahontas_ could have lost the sore-thumb
gargoyles and cute, mute Meeko the raccoon, respectively, without any major
loss to the film as a whole; however, the presence of Mushu, while still an
obvious concession to the masses, never feels gratuitous, and his funny
presence would be sorely missed.</P>
<P>Disney animated features have a rich musical tradition, and the downward
slide hinted at in _Hercules_ continues in _Mulan_.  _Mulan_ is the first
recent Disney animated effort that I feel could have easily survived
_without_ the songs, even if they are kept to a paltry (for Disney
standards) four.  Only two of the tunes by composer Matthew Wilder (yes, he
of "Break My Stride" fame) and _Hercules_ lyricist David Zippel, the lovely
if very short "Reflection," Mulan's de rigueur "I Want" song; and the
aforementioned "I'll Make a Man Out of You" serve a recognizable dramatic
purpose.  Nonetheless, Wilder deserves kudos for injecting some Oriental
flavor into the songs--for the most part, anyway (only "I'll Make a Man..."
sounds distinctly Western); but Zippel's lyrics are simply serviceable.
Picking up the slack is score composer Jerry Goldsmith, who gives _Mulan_
an appropriate epic sweep, most memorably in the haunting cue that
accompanies Mulan's fateful decision early in the film.</P>
<P>While the ears may be disappointed by _Mulan_, the eyes will be more than
satisfied.  Under the sure hands of directors Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft
and art director Ric Sluiter, _Mulan_'s look has a texture uncommon to most
animated features.  Backgrounds are kept fairly simple, and the screen is
often awash with scarlets and lavenders, creating a surreal yet emotionally
true visual landscape.  There's a general softness to the art, which fits
nicely the Eastern art tradition and lends the film a distinct identity and
personality.</P>
<P>I would not consider _Mulan_ to be in the upper echelon of Disney animated
features occupied by _Beauty_ and the highly underappreciated _Hunchback_,
but it ably upholds the Disney tradition of excellence.  Inspiring,
touching, serious, yet fun, _Mulan_ is animated entertainment of the
highest order, putting half-hearted efforts like Warner Bros.'s recent
_Quest_for_Camelot_ to shame.</P>
