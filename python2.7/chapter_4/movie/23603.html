<P>                These days, if you see a bunch of teens on the screen
you can bet they're on their way to either a) the bedroom, b) the prom,
or c) an early grave. The luckless bunch in "Final Destination" turns
out to be on the express train to Heaven, but the movie is so absurd the
audience may feel trapped on the highway to Hell.</P>
<P>       The best that can be said of "Destination" is it starts
off with an intriguing idea, which should remind some viewers of the
1996 TWA Flight 800 tragedy. High school senior Alex (Devon Sawa) is
about to embark on a flight to Paris with his fellow students when he
suddenly has a terrifying premonition and becomes convinced the plane
will explode. When Alex freaks out, he's removed from the aircraft,
along with several others, including the obnoxious bully Carter (Kerr
Smith) and the cryptic Clear (Ali Larter), a loner who doesn't seem to
be able to afford any shirts long enough to cover her belly-button.</P>
<P>       Within minutes after takeoff, the plane does in fact blow
up, which arouses the suspicions of the FBI and almost instantly makes
Alex about as popular in his community as poor Cassandra was in ancient
Troy. Only Clear seems sympathetic to this reluctant soothsayer and even
she bristles a bit when Alex begins insisting the worst is not over for
this handful of survivors.</P>
<P>       Up to this point, director James Wong has cobbled
together a passably cheesy chiller. But once Alex's cohorts start to die
off suddenly (due to such odd phenomena as unexplained surges of toilet
water and semis that manage to move silently through downtown streets),
"Destination" goes into an irreversible tailspin. As the screenplay
becomes progressively sillier, Wong tries to compensate by piling on the
gore -- it's not enough here for someone to merely get their throat
slashed if there's also a way to have them set on fire and impaled with
multiple steak knives.</P>
<P>      What's behind it all? Evil spirits? The ghost of a
disgruntled classmate? Satan? Since the screenwriters are too lazy to
think up an answer, they have Alex simply attribute all the mayhem to
"Death."</P>
<P>      Give Death some credit, though. Instead of simply
inflicting these kids with fatal aneurysms or sudden strokes, Death goes
all out to give each of its victims a splashy going-away party. When it
appears check-out time is near for Clear, Death sends lightning bolts
out of a cloudless sky, has a downed power cable shower her house with
sparks, finds a way to crack open her above-ground swimming pool and
even takes the time to blow up her car.</P>
<P>     One of Alex's teachers is identified as Val Lewton, which
may or may not be a nod to the great director of such horror classics as
"Cat People," "Isle of the Dead" and "The Leopard Man." What Lewton
understood -- and what Wong and company miss completely -- was that
often we're more frightened by what we don't see than what we do. So
even though "Final Destination" refuses to spare us a single bloody
detail, it's a whole lot less chilling than it was meant to be. James
