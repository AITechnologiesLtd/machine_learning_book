"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>This film in which guns play a major part in each pivotal scene is
probably supposed to start out as humorous look at the impact of
firearms in modern society before becoming shockingly appalling in its
last reel. The problem is that It's the Rage is neither funny nor
disturbing, and even its eclectic A-list cast can't save it from being
yet another bad Pulp Fiction rip-off.</P>
<P>Rage begins in the home of Warren and Helen Harding (played by
Pleasantville co-stars Jeff Daniels and Joan Allen), a wealthy yet
miserable couple that are awakened late one evening by what appears to
be a burglar. Warren guns down the intruder in the living room, but it
isn't until afterwards that he realizes that the prowler was actually
his business partner. Helen thinks her husband knowingly executed his
colleague, while Warren assumes that his associate was secretly
schtupping his wife. The cops (Robert Forster and Bokeem Woodbine) don't
know who to believe but are pretty sure that something fishy is going
on.</P>
<P>With murder acting as the final straw for their marriage, Helen moves
out and gets a job as an assistant to an insane billionaire named Norton
Morgan (Gary Sinise, Mission to Mars), who has made a fortune doing
something with computers, while simultaneously developing a fear of any
type of information. Norton chased away his previous assistant and now
spends his days cooped up in his giant office playing with his cyber-dog
and doesn't appear to be too into hygiene (but what computer billionaire
is?).</P>
<P>Norton's former assistant (Josh Brolin, The Mod Squad) dreams of making
movies for a living but instead finds work as a video store clerk and
develops a unhealthy fixation on a bleached-blonde, Bosco-stealing
delinquent named Annabel Lee (Anna Paquin, Rogue from X-Men). Rage also
features characters played by André Braugher (Frequency), David
Schwimmer (Friends) and Giovanni Ribisi (Gone in 60 Seconds), and all of
the film's characters are linked to each other, whether they know it or
not. In that respect, Rage is a bit like Magnolia or Short Cuts, but not
nearly as interesting or as well-executed as either.</P>
<P>While the acting in Rage isn't too bad, the script seems particularly
hackneyed. The whole harried-assistant-to-a-psychopath has already been
done to perfection by Frank Whalley (Swimming With Sharks) and Philip
Seymour Hoffman (The Big Lebowski). The bickering couple who live in the
large, soulless house reeks of Lester and Caroline Burnham (even though
Rage was completed before American Beauty was released). I can't think
of anything much worse than a film that thinks it's edgy and quirky but
just plain isn't.</P>
<P>Rage, which will see a brief theatrical run before bowing on pay
television, was directed by James D. Stern, who has recently helmed the
IMAX film Michael Jordan to the MAX, as well as directing Stomp on
Broadway. The script was written by Keith Reddin, who penned the play
Life During Wartime (adapted for the screen as The Alarmist), and Devo's
Mark Mothersbaugh (The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle) provides the
score.</P>
<P>1:37 – R for adult language, violence and sexual content</P>
