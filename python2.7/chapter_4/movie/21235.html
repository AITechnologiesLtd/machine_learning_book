<PRE>THREE TO TANGO
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Over the years I've gotten numerous letters from people infuriated at me
for not liking one of their favorite films. One of the frequent
complaints is that it is clear to them that I would never like the film
in the first place, so why did I bother to go?</P>
<P>Damon Santostefano's THREE TO TANGO, starring Matthew Perry, Neve
Campbell and Dylan McDermott, provides one answer to those questions.
(The other answer is that I review everything for my readers.) Going
into this movie, I had extremely low expectations. The last time I saw
the two male leads, FOOLS RUSH IN (Perry) and 'TIL THERE WAS YOU
(McDermott), I hated the pictures in general and their performances in
particular. Moreover, THREE TO TANGO's theme of a gay guy who really
isn't was not something that sounded at all promising.</P>
<P>What a pleasant surprise it turned out to be. A sweet little mistaken
identity story in a whimsical style reminiscent of Shakespeare's "As You
Like It," THREE TO TANGO doesn't have a pretentious bone in its body.
Its high-spirited swing music matches perfectly the happy tone of the
production. (The show is neatly bracketed with two energetic song and
dance numbers in the opening and closing credits.)  And lensed by Walt
Lloyd with a neon gloss of bright blues and greens, the picture looks
terrific.</P>
<P>As Amy, an upcoming, modern artist, Neve Campbell (WILD THINGS) gives an
adorable, pixyish performance that could charm the paint off the walls.
As superrich cad Charles Newman, Dylan McDermott turns his usually
unlikable demeanor into an attribute. Rodney Patrick Vaccaro's wryly
funny script is tailor-made for Matthew Perry as Oscar Novak, a
struggling architect. Nicely rounding out the cast is Oliver Platt
(BULWORTH), an always-funny actor, as Oscar's partner, Peter Steinberg.</P>
<P>When we meet the architectural firm of Novak and Steinberg, they are
about to make their proposal to Charles Newman for the renovation of The
Telford Building in Chicago. They find that they are hopelessly
outclassed in their presentation by a high-powered rival firm led by two
other architects, played by Bob Balaban and John C. McGinley.</P>
<P>Novak and Steinberg turn out to have one advantage. Oscar is mistakenly
assumed to be gay. (His partner is believed to be straight, when in
reality it's the other way around.)  Oscar, being gay, proves to be just
what Charles wants. Charles asks Oscar to spy on Amy, Charles's
mistress, to make sure she isn't seeing any of her old boyfriends. And
when, later, Amy ends up moving in with Oscar, even better. Life becomes
more and more complicated for Oscar as he falls head over heels in love
with Amy but doesn't dare tell her lest he lose his chance for the big
architectural contract. Amy bonds heavily with Oscar and tells him
things that she would never reveal to a potential boyfriend.</P>
<P>Perry's deadpan humor shines with some of his best lines being
unprintable. One scene that had no business working, but does, concerns
Oscar and Amy's first "date." After they eat rancid tuna-melts, they
both find that vomiting provides not only relief but an icebreaker in
their relationship as well due to their shared hardships. "It doesn't
get much better than this," Oscar says with a smiling sincerity after he
throws up. Done off screen, the regurgitation, my least favorite film
feature, manages to be surprisingly endearing.</P>
<P>As the story unfolds, Oscar and Amy's relationship deepens and is much
more believable than that of Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas in
RANDOM HEARTS. The sexual tension between Oscar and Amy is palpable even
if neither feels able to do anything about it. This tension is
especially in evidence in a funny bubble bath scene. Amy, completely
encased in opaque bubbles, starts telling Oscar about her one, brief
lesbian fling, which happened during college. He listens with wide-open
eyes. "I'm all for homosexuality when it comes to two gorgeous women --
or three," he says breathlessly in a revealing line.</P>
<P>Even when the movie turns slightly serious at the end, frequently the
kiss of death for comedies, the director makes the events credible, even
within the context of the unabashedly silly story. The result is a
romantic comedy with a genuine chemistry between the lovers and plenty
of laughs. A delightful story that manages somehow to be tender, it puts
a magical little spell on its audience.</P>
<P>THREE TO TANGO is rated PG-13 for sex-related situations and language
and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
