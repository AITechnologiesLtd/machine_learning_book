<P>Teen comedies were abundant in 1999, we had "She's All That", "Never Been
Kissed", "10 Things I Hate About You" and so many more....they were good
movies, but the bad things were the PG-13 ratings. I mean a teen's life is not
PG-13 and in 2000 we've had already three PG-13 teen movies, and they will
continue. In July of 1999, a raunchy NC-17 rated film that was all about teens
started to buzz, and was finally cut down to an R and released into theatres.
The film was what a real teens life was all about, no proms (well no good
proms) and no love stories, the film was "American Pie" a classic for the 90's.
It was a straight teen film, and it was a huge hit, which will definately spawn
a ton of copies. The first being the unbelievably funny "Road Trip" a new R
rated teen comedy that comes just at the right time when we are getting tired
or PG-13 teen movies.</P>
<P>Breckin Meyer plays Josh, a student at the University of Ithica in New York.
Josh and his girlfriend are at seperate colleges, but he is bent on staying
faithful, until her roomate tells him that she doesn't want him anymore. His
girlfriend is Tiffany played by the ever so beautiful Rachel Blanchard. Josh
meets Beth (Amy Smart) and the two go to a party, get drunk and make a sex tape
together, only to have his friend Rubin accidentally sends it to Tiffany,
causing Josh, Rubin, E.L. (played hilariously by Seann William Scott) and Kyle
(DJ Qualls) to have to go on a road trip across the country to retrieve the
tape. On the way there they encounter several misadventures that are gut
bustingly funny!</P>
<P>"Road Trip" is smartly written, very well directed, and the cast is having some
fun in their roles. To note Breckin Meyer is a great actor. He is funny, smart
and he fills the screen without getting on our nerves or hoping he was gone.
Seann William Scott was classic in "American Pie" as the sex-luvin Stiffler,
who in the end got what he deserved. Paulo Costanzo is a very talented actor
and fits the role of Rubin quite well, and DJ Qualls is irreplaceable as the
skinny Kyle, who seems to like people not his size.</P>
<P>Even though I didn't think "Road Trip" was as good as "American Pie" it was a
still a fantastic film. At times I almost choked to death from laughing so
hard. Some of you may say will most of this has been done yada yada yada, well
actually yeah it has, but some of these jokes are just so put well that we
forgive their unorginality. The cast is incredinly lovable and seems to be
having great fun with their roles, and Tom Green is just great as Barry the
overaged college student who at the beginning and end of the film is giving a
tour of the school.</P>
<P>I thoroughly enjoyed "Road Trip" it has a few flaws here and there, but its
raunchy and funny, and in the end a sweet love story that we actually get
involved in. Maybe we will get more R rated teen comedies, that actually show
how a teen's life is. A teen's life isnt PG-13 its definately NC-17 or X. I
can't wait now for American Pie 2 next year. Go see "Road Trip"  I guaratee
it's going to be one of the funnest times at the movies in the year 2000.</P>
