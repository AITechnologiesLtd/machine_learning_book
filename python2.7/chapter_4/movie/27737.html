<PRE>LAST RESORT
-----------</PRE>
<P>When Eastern European Tanya (Dina Korzun) leaves home with her 10-year-old 
son Artiom (Artoim Strelnikov) to meet her English fiance Mark, she instead 
finds herself a refugee with no money, no prospects and no passport in "Last 
Resort."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Artiom realizes that Mark is as neurotic as his mom and knows her hopes
will be dashed before she does.  Forced by circumstances to declare herself
and her son refugees, Tanya and Artiom are trucked off to Stonehaven, a former
honky tonk beachside amusement park, where refugees are housed in a cold,
dismal, forbidding apartment building behind barbed wire fences policed by
guard dogs.  Without money, there's no escape - 12 to 16 months before being
let out into English freedom, 4-6 months to be officially deported.  The
only money to be made is by selling goods, blood or yourself, if you happen
to be an attractive young woman.</P>
<P>Tanya meets Alfie (Paddy Considine, "A Room for Romeo Brass"), the manager
of the local arcade, in search for a phone card to attempt to reach Mark.
Shaggy, hangdog Alfie, initially a suspicious character who appears to 
leech his living off the unfortunates of Stonehaven, changes our opinion
of him in a nanosecond with the smile he flashes at Tanya.  Once
Tanya finally accepts the truth about Mark and sees the friendship that's
developed between Artiom and Alfie, a tentative romance begins.  However
the self realization the whole humiliating experience has brought to Tanya 
means she won't allow herself to slip back into her old dependencies.</P>
<P>Polish writer/director Pawel Pawlikowski has created a small gem of a movie.
His and cowriter Rowan Joffe's creative blending of an almost Kafkaesque 
political situation with both a gentle love story and a mother's journey to 
maturity is rivetting storytelling.  Visually, he and director of photography 
Ryszard Lenczewski combines jarringly close hand held camerawork with 
gorgeously framed, pastel character palletted landscapes.  Original music by 
Max de Wardener adds melancholy with the ghost-like refrains of the shuttered 
amusement park.</P>
<P>Pawlikowski is also blessed with an outstanding, natural cast.  Dina Korzun
allows a gamut of emotion to play across her open, innocent face.  She's
resigned when she goes to pornographer Les (Lindsey Honey, the real life
'most famous pornographer in Britain'), then girlishly amused by the skit he
pantomimes for her before ultimately breaking down with the shame of it when 
finally being broadcast over the internet.  She works marvelously well with 
Considine,whose shaggy charm and reigned in hope make the viewer root for him.
Considine makes the combination of a tough realist and a romantic work.
Strelnikov is astonishingly confident in his screen debut as the ten year
old street smart kid who adapts to a bad situation not of his making.</P>
<P>Thank goodness for the Shooting Gallery - while Hollywood continues
to churn out very little of interest, they rescue great little films like
"Last Resort" from obscurity.</P>
