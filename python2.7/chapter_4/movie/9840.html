<P>Well, the previews had us SF-types drooling for most of the year, and
it looks as though Paul Verhoven has delivered a reasonable product to
justify our wait. We get plenty of cutting edge special effects, and
unlike Spielberg's "Lost World," this one has a coherent story behind
it. Not a new story, though. Some have labeled this a parody, but I see
a careful reworking of a W.W.II B-movie, retreaded with futuristic
gadgetry and foes. There is some "1984" and some classic wartime
propaganda thrown in, but it is the inherent absurdities of those genres
that inspires any amusement.</P>
<P>Since this is a special effects movie, there's no sense spending the
budget on big names. We follow high school senior Rico (Casper Van
Dien), who is being pursued by Dizzy (Dina Meyer). But Rico is only
interested in Carmen (Denise Richards). Most of the action revolves
around these three, but we also get psychic Carl (Neil Patrick Harris).
And just so you don't think EVERYONE in the future is beautiful, the
gene pool still allows for a rodent-toothed Busey (Jake). Adult mentors
Michael Ironside and Clancy Brown round out a cast that keeps running
into each other, even though they all go their separate directions.</P>
<P>Carmen is one of those "natural pilots we always find in the movies,
and she plans to join the military. In this future society, you are
either a non-voting layabout, or a citizen, who has earned this status
by a hitch in the military. Rico's family is rich enough that he doesn't
need citizenship, but he wants to impress Carmen, so the fool signs up
anyway. Not smart enough for fleet, he ends up in the Mobile Infantry
(laser-cannon fodder). Dizzy joins to be near Rico, and the psychic goes
off to Intelligence, natch.</P>
<P>The military trappings are intentionally evocative of totalitarian
Germans and Soviets. This unified-world army would have been believable
as the army Orwell mentioned in Big Brother's news reports. There are
such news broadcasts here, presented with a CNN/Internet style. They
have the exhortative propaganda feel of 1984, with little of the parody
that Verhoven employed in his Robocop happy-news bits. </P>
<P>Once the war with the alien "bugs" starts, we are treated to plenty of
complex battle scenes, with hundreds of Arachnids kicking our butt.
Inexplicably, no good tactics are developed to deal with these superior
warriors. Our guys just fire their automatic weapons at 14-foot
arthropods that keep on slashing, even when half of their limbs are shot
off. Also unexplained is what these bugs do for a living as the sole
creatures on a barren planet. The ability of huge "tankers" to spit
fiery plasma is an interesting adaptation for a race that shows no signs
of tool-use. The bugs on the screen may appear three-dimensional, but
they truly have no depth. In contrast, the franchise antagonists in
"Alien" and "Predator" have enough definition that an audience member
could conjure up his own backstory. </P>
<P>Computer graphic imaging (CGI) was a new toy for stop-action expert
Phil Tippet when he built his dinos for Jurassic Park. Overseeing
Starship's effects, he was able to bring the many images together by
farming out pieces to several different effects houses. This movie does
not give us a quantum leap in technology, but it does signal that
Hollywood has turned the corner on producing CGI. Lesser efforts like
"Spawn" and "Mortal Kombat II" can now be churned out regularly, without
using the resources of a Manhattan Project. This movie does not rate a
position of honor comparable to Robert A Heinlein's source novel, but it
IS pretty cool.</P>
