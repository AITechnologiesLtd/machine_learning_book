<P>The Happy Bastard's Quick Movie Review</P>
<PRE>SOUTH PARK: BIGGER LONGER & UNCUT</PRE>
<P>Any movie that has a musical number that goes "Shut your f***ing face,
uncle f***er" can't be all bad, right?</P>
<P>Unlike most TV-show-to-movie translations, South Park: Bigger Longer &
Uncut shows an incredible urgency as it arrives on the big screen,
offering the same old visuals and the same old setting, but introducing
energetic dialogue (complete with profanity) and musical numbers that
really stand out from the usual disgusting comedy scene.  Trey Parker
and Matt Stone are commended for not standing down to the viciousness of
the MPAA.</P>
<P>The story's rather ironic, considering it's likely to happen in real
life: the South Park gang, consisting of jewish Kyle, barfing Stan, big
fat Eric Cartman, and the ever-dying Kenny, sneak into an R-rated movie
called "Asses of Fire", starring their favorite Canadian duo, Terence
and Phillip.  Upon viewing of the movie, they pick up several pieces of
profanity that they begin spewing everywhere, particularly at their
school, where trouble begins to brew.  That's when Kyle's overdefensive
mother begins a campaign called Mothers Against Canada, and it soon
brews into a war between the United States and Canada, with Terence and
Phillip held as prisoners of war, scheduled to be executed following a
big USO show with Big Gay Al.  On top of all this, if they do die, Satan
and his new lover, the impeccable Saddam Hussein (whose real head is
actually used on a figure in the movie) will take over the world.  Still
with me?</P>
<P>As I stated, the animation is pretty similar to what was seen on the
show.  At some points, there is some computer animation assistance, but
not to the point that you're forgetting you're watching cardboard
cutouts.  Still, everything appears as it would in the world of South
Park, and I really wouldn't have it any other way.</P>
<P>The script and musical numbers, however, are the real surprise here.
Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of South Park, simply could've
filled the movie with obscenities and it would've sold, but they've gone
the extra mile constructing great jokes and great little music bits like
the aforementioned "Uncle F***er" and an extended, choir-backed "Kyle's
Mom Is a Big Fat Bitch".  I even picked up the soundtrack just for
kicks.  There's some great sick jokes in here, too, not to mention a
clever little nod to The Phantom Menace and Dragon Ball Z.</P>
<P>The voicework is also top notch.  Although most of the voices are
provided by Parker and Stone, celebrities like George Clooney (who's
more than just a gay dog in the role of a doctor), Minnie Driver (who's
humorous in her bit as Brooke Shields- yes, Brooke Shields), and Eric
Idle (as a scientist who helps install a V-chip in Eric Cartman's head
to stop his incessant cursing- he's hilarious) add icing to the cake.
Also, a nod of the hat to Marc Shaiman for helping organize the great
musical numbers.  However, did we really need Satan doing a dramatic
number?  The irony is kinda funny, but the number was flat.</P>
<P>There's plenty of sick, disgusting laughs throughout the movie, as it's
smarter than your average curse-fest.  Sure, it's not for kids (make
sure they go see Tarzan instead- and STAY there), but adults will have a
riot of a time if they can tolerate the language.  I know I could, but,
then again, I'm a South Park fan.  And I'm not "fat ass".</P>
<PRE>RATING: 8 (out of 10)</PRE>
