<PRE>                              HOT SHOTS! PART DEUX
                       A film review by Gregory N. Bond
                        Copyright 1993 Gregory N. Bond</PRE>
<P>[Again, just released locally but probably old news to many of you.
FLYING HIGH was released as AIRPLANE! in the U.S.]</P>
<P>     This is made by (one of) the same people who did FLYING HIGH, TOP
SECRET and the original HOT SHOTS.  Like all of the above, it is chock
full of sight gags, one liners, running jokes and not very subtle
parodies of other movies. I noticed among others: Just about every
RAMBO film, a huge swipe at BASIC INSTINCT, CASABLANCA, TERMINATOR 2,
ROBIN HOOD - PRINCE OF THIEVES (and most other sword-and-valour
flicks), APOCALYPSE NOW, SPACEBALLS, STAR WARS, and probably a dozen
more that I couldn't exactly place.</P>
<P>     The basic story is RAMBO 2 done over: got to get the hostages out,
this time from Iraq.  Plenty of gags about Hussein, none of which are
complimentary.  Lloyd Bridges is completely over the top as the
befuddled U.S. President, Charlie Sheen with a fair bit of added bulk
does a good line in brooding, and a bunch of look-alikes in various
supporting roles.  I found that as a whole it worked better than the
previous HOT SHOTS, with more laughs and a more even production.
However, the style is not universally favoured.  If you are the type
left cold by FLYING HIGH, this movie is not for you.</P>
<P>     All in all it works very well, and I laughed a lot.  Worth a look
at $7.50 prices, certainly worth it for a video night.  Rated M for
some fairly heavy sexual innuendo, but no skin shown.</P>
<P>The Second Test at Lords on the Sid and Nancy scale.
