<P>"Wonder Boys" represents a dandy twist on a relatively new genre, the
coming-of-middle-age story. Generally, films of this type (the
outstanding "American Beauty" is a fine example) focus on men beaten
into numbness or despair by the crushing weight of time, responsibility
and social conventions. When some unusual event jerks them into
awareness, they respond by rebelling against the norm, desperately
trying to recapture the vitality of youth. After colorfully acting out,
usually by aping behaviors straight out of "Animal House," they
eventually learn valuable life lessons that help them put their world in
a better perspective.</P>
<P>Things are different for English professor Grady Tripp (Michael
Douglas). In his cozy academic cocoon, he never had to grow up in the
first place. A celebrated author, Grady smokes dope almost constantly,
regularly bangs his boss' wife and enjoys reverential treatment from his
students and the college staff. Still, he is an unhappy man. As the
story begins, his wife has left him and his girlfriend, Chancellor Sara
Gaskell (Frances McDormand), has just announced she is pregnant with his
child.</P>
<P>Once the wonder boy of the literati, Grady has become crippled by the
success of his novel. The follow-up is long overdue and many secretly
believe he is suffering from writer's block. In fact, the exact opposite
is true. Privately, he cranks out a dizzying number of pages for his
latest, a massive tome that makes "War and Peace" look like a pamphlet
by comparison. Terrified that the book won't live up to its predecessor,
Grady continues writing as a way of avoiding completion, and
examination, of his work. Unfortunately, his editor is about to arrive
for Wordfest, the university's annual literary festival, and Grady knows
the heat is on.</P>
<P>But wait, that's just the beginning. Within a few hours, Grady will find
himself dealing with a gifted (and very freaky) student who may be a
pathological liar, the police, a furious gent with James Brown hair, a
stolen jacket once worn by Marilyn Monroe, and a dead dog. And you
thought your weekends were hectic.</P>
<P>Adapted by Steve Kloves from Michael Chabon's 1995 novel, "Wonder Boys"
is the first movie for director Curtis Hanson since his magnificent
"L.A. Confidential," and it shows the filmmaker in excellent form.
Gliding from humor to poignancy with the greatest of ease, Hanson has
crafted a smart, sophisticated feature that will delight mature
audiences. While the wacky elements are occasionally laid on a bit
thick, this is a movie to treasure. Adding to the enjoyment is the
timing of its release – how often do we get quality adult fare in the
middle of winter?</P>
<P>The casting for "Wonder Boys" is impeccable. After playing so many oily
rich creeps that the very mention of his name makes me shudder, Michael
Douglas gives possibly the best performance of his career as the
rumpled, aging man-child. Whether the scene calls for laughs or
heartache, Douglas' line delivery and affect is dead on, without a
moment that seems forced. Grady is a mess, but a lovable one, and
Douglas deserves great praise for his work.</P>
<P>As James Lee, Grady's most talented, and disturbed, student, Tobey
Maguire is perfect for the role. I've grown tired of Maguire taking jobs
where he is required to do little more than flash his odd kewpy-doll
smile and act inscrutable, but in this context, that's exactly what is
called for and Maguire plays off Douglas superbly. Still, I hope that
Maguire starts selecting parts that demand a wider range of expression.
Also, it would be nice if he spent some time outdoors, because there are
coma patients whose skin has more color than this kid.</P>
<P>The supporting actors are just as good. Robert Downey Jr. is delightful
as Grady's editor Terry Grabtree, mixing flamboyance and functionality
with grand style. Downey's ongoing drug problems have made him a
national punchline, and this film is yet another reminder that he is one
of the finest actors working today. Hopefully, Downey will conquer his
personal demons and get back on track soon.</P>
<P>As Chancellor Sara Gaskell, Frances McDormand is compelling, although
she doesn't get a lot of screen time. The same holds true for "Dawson's
Creek's" Katie Holmes, who still manages to make a big impression while
serving as a strong stabilizing presence in the midst of all the
madness. Richard Thomas and the dynamic Rip Torn also appear, but,
sadly, both are given scant time in the film.</P>
<P>In addition to its stellar cast and rich storyline, "Wonder Boys" also
boasts a hell of a soundtrack, including a memorable new Bob Dylan song.</P>
<P>Because this is a tale of humor mixed with substance rather than the
typical flashy Hollywood fare, it would be easy for "Wonder Boys" to be
overlooked by filmgoers. Don't make that mistake. Regardless of your
age, this coming-of-middle-age story has something for everyone. If you
want winter to consist of more substantial fare than formulaic crap like
"Reindeer Games," here's a chance to put your money where your mouth is.</P>
