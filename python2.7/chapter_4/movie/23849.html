<P>''Return to Me'' is the kind of film I normally shred with the
enthusiasm of a puppy that just snagged your favorite slipper. The
romantic comedy is unabashedly sentimental, with plot contrivances
galore, stereotypical supporting players, overdone accents, nuns on
bicycles and an adorable gorilla. As if all that wasn't enough, it even
features Jim Belushi, whose very presence is enough to cause most
productions to implode. But from beginning to end, I found the film
utterly charming. Hell, I even liked Belushi.</P>
<P>Oh, what an awkward position for a jaded critic to be in.</P>
<P>First time director Bonnie Hunt (who also co-wrote the script and plays
a key role) casts David Duchovny and Minnie Driver in her fairy tale.
Duchovny plays Bob, a Chicago architect who loses his zoologist wife
Elizabeth (Joely Richardson) in a car wreck. Minnie Driver is Grace, a
barmaid on the waiting list for a healthy heart who receives a second
lease on life thanks to Elizabeth.</P>
<P>Months later, Bob wanders into the funky little restaurant run by
Grace's Irish grandfather (Carroll O'Connor) and Italian great-uncle
(Robert Loggia). The old boys play matchmaker, leading to the inevitable
pairing of Bob and Grace. Of course, the road to romance is rocky. Bob
still grieves the loss of Elizabeth and Grace is so painfully
self-conscious of her surgical scar that she's afraid to get intimate
with anyone. Cautiously, they begin the courtship ritual.</P>
<P>This may read like typical cutesy-poo fare, but that's only because it
is. And there's more. When O'Connor (who uses an Irish accent straight
out of a ''Lucky Charms'' commercial), Loggia and company aren't
hovering over the couple like mother hens, they spend their time
exchanging good-natured insults and debating the merits of vintage
singers. Going into sugar shock, yet? Well, try this on for size. The
ape Elizabeth worked with had a special gesture he used only with her.
When Grace visits the zoo, he cozies up to her right away. How cosmic.</P>
<P>The film has a fair share of chunky shtick as well. Bob's best pal
(David Alan Grier) fixes him up for an evening out, leading to some
extreme overacting from Bob's boorish date. There's also a running gag
over Jim Belushi's efforts to stop swearing in front of his kids. And we
have the aforementioned encounter with a perky bicycle-riding nun.</P>
<P>I could go on, but you get the idea. There's enough sweetness here for a
dozen Meg Ryan movies, but the damned thing still got to me.</P>
<PRE>Why?</PRE>
<P>Part of the reason is Minnie Driver and David Duchovny. Driver projects
a disarming vulnerability and, at long last, Duchovny drops his
''X-Files'' ironic cool and plays a guy who smiles and laughs and cries
like an actual human being. Together, they made me care about the
well-being of their characters.</P>
<P>Another reason is Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi. As Grace's closest
friends, they make a dandy couple. Hunt's tongue is as sharp as ever,
but nicely tempered by her nurturing qualities. As for Belushi, after
screwing up a long series of leading man roles, he is very likable in a
supporting turn, playing an affable lug quite comfortable in his skin. A
scene where he does an impromptu belly dance for Grace and his wife is
funny and appealing. Few other actors could successfully pull that off.</P>
<P>But the biggest reason is Bonnie Hunt's direction. She establishes and
maintains a fairy tale sensibility that makes the convoluted plotting
easy to tolerate. Hunt obviously conveyed her storybook approach to the
supporting cast, convincing them to go for magic over credibility.</P>
<P>The magic worked for me. I enjoyed spending a couple of hours in a world
where loving relatives dote over your every move, where caring friends
are there when you need them, and where romance triumphs over all.</P>
<P>There you have it. ''Return to Me'' is a cavalcade of corn, but I had a
ball. So sue me. Incidentally, I plan to keep this review handy from now
on. Whenever anyone fires off an irate letter accusing me of being a
cold-hearted bastard because I ragged on the latest mawkish offering
from Robin Williams, I'll send them a copy of this and let them choke on
it.</P>
