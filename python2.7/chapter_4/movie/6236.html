                         Dear God (1996)
                   A film review by Ben Hoffman
                    Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>          DEAR GOD is a pleasant enough comedy and Tom Turner (Greg
Kinnear) is a pleasant enough young man and all would have been well
if the very talented director had not gone overboard and made the
comedy utterly ludicrous and unbelievable.   The one saving grace is
that of Rebecca Frazen (Laurie Metcalf).  Metcalf turns in a most
hilarious performance when she suddenly emerges as an attorney in one
of the funniest bits of acting I can remember.  She is a gem!</P>
<P>          The story is simple.  Tom Turner is a conman.  He owes his
"friends" money that he cannot repay.  When a judge gives him a choice
of sentence, either prison or get a real job, he has to stop and think
before opting for the job.  Reminded me of Jack Benny when, in one of
his stingy skits, he is confronted by a holdup man who says "Your
money or your life" and Benny has to stop and think.  Turner finally
opts for the job.</P>
<P>          Turner works in the dead-letter department of the post
office with a bunch of weird characters played by Tim Conway, Roscoe
Lee Browne, Anna Maria Horsford and several more.  Also in the cast
are Hector Elizondo as the supervisor, Rue McClanahan and Jack
Klugman.  Nancy Marchand is the judge at film's end.  Maria Petillo is
the love interest.</P>
<P>          Turner wonders what to do with letters addressed to God from
people asking for help.  He decides to help them, an unlikely turn for
a conman . . . and so no one on the outside believes him.  But the
film gets crazy when hundreds of postal workers, with their vehicles,
surround the courthouse, and others with placards saying "Save Tom"
kind of moves the film from funny to utterly silly.  On the other
hand, it is a feel-good film so let us not carp.</P>
<PRE>                     Directed by Garry Marshall.</PRE>
