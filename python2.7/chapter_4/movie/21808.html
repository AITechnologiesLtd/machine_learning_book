<P>PLOT:
A giant metal man falls from the sky and befriends a small town kid whose
imagination and enthusiasm rank highly in his repertoire of qualities.
Unfortunately for the friendly duo, the United States government of the
1950s does not take too well to "alien" beings, and attempts to violently
get rid of the giant monster.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Hmmm...a serious animated movie with a message? Well, I'm sure it could work
but this one sure didn't do much for me. The ending of this movie was nice
with the deeper meaning and emotional touches, but for most of its run time
I found myself bored, searching for something-anything, nice music, some
humor or even a touch of romance or action, to make the film interesting to
watch. It wasn't to be. This E.T.-type flick moved along at such a neutral
pace that I kept wondering if anything interesting was ever going to happen!
Well, nothing really did and since I don't consider myself much of a 50s
connaisseur, or a sci-fi comic book enthusiast, there wasn't very much in
this films' ho-hum story that engaged me in any way. Of course, matters
weren't helped by the fact that the only so-called "bad guy" in the film was
completely one-dimensional and that the animation was obviously not intended
to impress. Think of it as an after school television cartoon program
elongated to match the length of a full feature and that's pretty much all
you have here. Much like the BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, I am not exactly sure what
all the hype about this movie is about either.</P>
