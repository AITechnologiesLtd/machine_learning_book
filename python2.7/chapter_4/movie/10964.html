<P>It would be easy to dismiss "The Wedding Singer." The film is admittedly 
fluff; just another throwaway comedy from a Saturday Night Live alumnus. 
The characters are mostly two-dimensional and the jokes are obvious and 
often corny. But the central romantic storyline is so sweet and good 
natured that it's fairly easy to overlook the film's many shortcomings. 
Ultimately, "The Wedding Singer" succeeds as light entertainment, a 
surprising triumph of charm over shtick.
Set in 1985, the story focuses on Robby Hart (Adam Sandler,) a former 
rock star wannabe who earns his living singing at weddings. Robby is very 
good at his job, as evidenced in the opening scene, when a drunken best 
man (Steve Buscemi) turns a toast into a hateful tirade and Robby's adept 
damage control defuses the volatile situation. An incurable romantic, 
Robby's world comes crashing down around him when his childhood 
sweetheart (Angela Featherstone) leaves him standing at the altar. He 
collapses into a bundle of pain and self-pity, only to be drawn out by 
Julia (Drew Barrymore,) an innocent young co-worker engaged to a 
philandering stud (Matthew Glave.) Will Robby and Julia escape their 
wretched fates and find true love together? You do the math.
>From a script by Judd Apatow, Carrie Fisher and Tim Herlihy, "The Wedding 
Singer" operates on two very elementary levels. There's the love story, 
of course, which is straightforward and sentimental without getting too 
sticky. The rest of the film is broad comedy, playing off the pop culture 
and manners of the mid-80s. Predictably, the film makes great sport of 
the entertainment and fashions of the period. Julia's fiancee wears the 
latest "Miami Vice" pastel outfits, complete with a perpetual three-day 
growth of beard. Other supporting characters ape the fashion stylings of 
Boy George, Madonna and Michael Jackson, while jokes about Rubik's Cubes, 
"Dallas,"  A Flock Of Seagulls and Van Halen are self-consciously 
inserted. The gags about the 80s are sometimes funny, despite being 
overly obvious and smug. In a few years, we'll probably be subjected to 
comedies looking back on those wacky days in the 90s, featuring tattooed, 
multi-pierced characters in droopy trousers prattling on about Laser Tag, 
"South Park," and the Spice Girls. The film's most tired joke involves an 
elderly person acting "hip," in this case an old lady "bustin' a move" to 
the Sugarhill Gang's "Rapper's Delight." Back in 1972, Ruth Gordon 
pioneered the "isn't it hilarious when octogenarians use trendy slang and 
swear" genre of comedy in "Harold and Maude." It was funny then, but only 
for about half of the film. 26 years later, the joke is annoying beyond 
belief. 
So why is "The Wedding Singer" getting a marginal recommendation? Because 
of Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler. Barrymore has grown from "that cute 
little girl in 'E.T.'" into a beautiful, fresh-faced young woman. A few 
years ago, Barrymore appeared on David Letterman's show the night he was 
celebrating his birthday. As her gift, she danced on his desk, at one 
point turning her back on the audience and briefly flashing her breasts 
at Dave. On numerous occasions, Letterman has talked about his fond 
memories of the incident, always describing Barrymore as "charming" and 
"sweet." It's easy to understand why he'd feel that way. Barrymore 
possesses such an air of innocence that actions that might seem vulgar if 
done be others come off as playful and disarming. As Julia, she is a 
delight, radiating a fresh-scrubbed goodness and generating real 
chemistry with Sandler. 
For his part, Sandler does his best film work to date, playing an actual 
person for the first time. Sandler, who can somehow look handsome and 
gooney simultaneously, is an intriguing performer, with a career built on 
playing a variety of whining half-wits. He's the kind of comic who is 
often funny, but just as often so irritating that you'd like to take a 
swing at him. In "The Wedding Singer," Sandler reigns in his more 
annoying character traits for the most part, playing a veritable Boy 
Scout lost in the self-centered, hedonistic 80s. If he continues in this 
vein and avoids reverting to his idiot persona, he may actually be able 
to play a full-fledged adult someday.
In addition to Sandler and Barrymore, "The Wedding Singer" boasts a 
terrific soundtrack, packed with great songs from the 80s. Pretend-punk 
Billy Idol even makes a cameo appearance, playing himself in the film's 
cheesy, but satisfying climax.
Thanks to Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, "The Wedding Singer" is a 
modest success, offering laughs and a tender romance to boot. The film is 
just a trifle, but in the mid-winter cinematic wasteland, you have to 
grade on a curve.</P>
