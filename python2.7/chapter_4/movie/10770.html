<PRE>A Film Review by Jason Wallis </PRE>
<P>"The Last Temptation of Christ" * * * * 
Starring Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, Barbara Hershey, Harry Dean Stanton,
David Bowie, Verna Bloom, Andre Gregory, Juliette Caton, Roberts Blossom,
Irvin Kershner, Nehemiah Persoff and Barry Miller 
Directed by Martin Scorsese </P>
<P>It is very rare that a film comes along and transends the way we look at
someone or something. A film that actually has the power to change the way
someone thinks. Martin Scorsese's epic masterpiece "The Last Temptation of
Christ" does just that. Watching it, you can feel that you are in the
presence of true genius and are viewing one of the most remarkable films of
our time. </P>
<P>And I know what you're all thinking: is Scorsese really the right guy to
direct a film of this nature? I was thinking precisely the same thing.
Actually, he is the only one that could pull it off without seeming preachy
or making the movie contrived. When you see the movie, you'll know exactly
what I'm talking about. No other director (that I'm familiar with, anyway)
could have put as much thought or passion into this film as Scorsese has.
As any true Marty fan knows, he grew up with dreams of becoming a priest.
Fortunantly, he became a filmmaker instead but, with this, has made up for
not becoming a man of the cloth as he has intended. He has made barnone the
greatest religious or biblical movie of all time. </P>
<P>Another aspect I wanted to tackle right off the bat is the argument that
this film is blasphomy. Being based on Nikos Kazantzakis' novel, it has
actually succeeded in becoming even more controversial that the material
from which it was based. The thing is this: in a scene late in the film,
there is a sexual encounter between Jesus and Mary Magdeline. Blasphomy,
right? The hook: it is not taking place in reality. It's all part of an
elaborate trick being played on Jesus by Satan, who is tempting him by
showing what his life probably would have been like if he had been born a
mortal man. Now, being the strict Christian that I am, if Scorsese had
shown this in any other light, I would not be recommending this film to the
extent that I am. But he is doing it to prove a point. It is, ultimently,
the last temptation of Christ. Satan is preying on him when he is at his
weakest; dying on the cross. </P>
<P>Now that those two points are out of the way, I can discuss the film. Like
I said, a movie of this power and beauty comes along once in a blue moon.
As I hope you have already guessed, it tells the story of Jesus Christ, who
we all have been brought up to believe was a purely perfect man that did
not possess any of the human qualities that every man has; such as fear,
longing, anger, etc. If you say he had these qualities, just like anyone
else does, that is considered a sin. Why? If he was born a man, then why
shouldn't he be born with at least some of the emotional qualities that all
people have? And if he was purely perfect, then how could he have been
tempted for forty days and forty nights in the desert? God forgive me if
I'm wrong, but maybe Jesus, despite popular opinion, did have his faults
and emotions as any other person has. </P>
<P>Don't get me wrong here; I am a Christian and I do believe that Jesus was a
divine human being and the son of God. So I don't want hate-mail from all
you devout Christians out there who may be reading this (what am I saying;
hardly anyone reads this, let alone devout Christians). Just wanted to get
that point across. </P>
<P>I'm going to be redundant here and mention again that Scorsese was the only
person who could have directed this movie. He adds just the touch to every
scene. For instance, when Jesus trashes the temple, turning tables up and
whatnot, you can see the intensity. I don't know how else to describe it.
You can just feel it. Not just at that part, either. The night that Jesus
is to be captured, he goes to pray in the forest. Marty adds exactly the
right amount of sentimentality to the characters that it evokes certain
emotions that very few films can make come out. </P>
<P>I guess that's also thanks to the wonderful performances throughout the
movie. Willem Dafoe is the perfect Christ, and Barbara Hershey makes and
wonderful Mary. But then there's the roles of Judas and Sal (Harvey Keitel
and Harry Dean Stanton, respectivly). I mean, they're great in they're
roles and all, but I just think they should have switched parts. It's
obvious that Judas was a very guilt-ridden man and that Sal was very
intense and pronounced. Now, does Keitel look guilt-ridden? Does Stanton
look intense? Hell no. They really aren't fit for their roles, but they do
a pretty good job anyway. </P>
<P>There's really not a whole lot to say about the story. We all know it by
now. We've all been taught about the disciples and the last supper and all
that. But Scorsese has put a completely different spin on what has been
generally regarded as the greatest story ever told. And in every scene, you
can see that special touch that only Marty can do. </P>
<P>"The Last Temptation of Christ" belongs up there with the director's other
efforts, including the brilliant "Raging Bull" or "GoodFellas". And I can
only hope that those who have so blindly dismissed it as blasphomy will
give it another look. </P>
