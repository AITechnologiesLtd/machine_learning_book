<PRE>                             UNDERCOVER BLUES
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  1/2</PRE>
<PRE>         [This is one of my golden oldies reviews - written years
          ago when I was just getting started and never posted.
          I stand by the conclusions, but in most cases many details
          are missing that I would normally include today.]</PRE>
<P>     For timing reasons having to do with baby sitters, we recently
went to a multiplex and saw UNDERCOVER BLUES.</P>
<P>     I would give it one half of a star for guts.  Anyone in a movie
this bad would have to have guts.  I later read a NY Times review that
said Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid had gotten so plump they looked
like they had the mumps in the show.</P>
<P>     The script was the worst part.  They had characters who talked
with funny accents in an attempt to make you laugh. They had lots of
"great" sight gags like two people trying to go in a door together and
therefore bumping shoulders against the door.</P>
<P>     Turner and Quaid both kept smiling like some idiots on a game
show.  The good news is that we were smart enough to vote with our feet
and left.  Buy some tickets and give them to your worst enemies.  Tell
them the show is great and smile a lot.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
