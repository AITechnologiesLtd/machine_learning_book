<P>I won't be coy; I'll just say it straight: I loved this movie.  If you
hang on my every word, then the rest of this review can wait till later;
hie thee to your local cineplex pronto, bucko.  And be sure to watch the
kids in the front aisle.  If, like I was before I went to see "Toy Story
2", you're in need of a good dose of cheer, the kids in the front aisle
will bring as much of that as watching the movie itself will.  Trust
Bammer on that one.</P>
<P>Ah, you're still here.  Alrighty then; I guess I should earn my keep by
actually reviewing this flick...</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: some spoilers contained below):
As the taglines so playfully pun, "the Toys are back in town": the old
familiar faces (and voices) that many of us grew up with--even if "grew up
with" started with the original "Toy Story"--come back to the big screen. 
Our old pals Andy (Morris) and his "living" Toys, cowboy Woody (Hanks),
astronaunt Buzz Lightyear (Allen), Mr. Potato Head (Rickles), Slinky Dog
(Varney), dinosaur Rex (Shawn), Hamm the piggy bank (Ratzenberger), Green
Army Men Sergeant (Ermey)  and Woody's lady, Bo Peep (Potts, complete with
Peep's Sheep), make a return appearance; they're joined by cowgirl Jessie
(Cusack), Stinky Pete The Prospector (Grammer), Bullseye the horse
(Stiers), Mrs. Potato Head (Harris), Tour Guide Barbie (Benson), and
probably the Father of the beanie-baby craze, Al The Toy
Collector/"Chicken Man" (Knight), in a tale that combines humor,
nostalgia, amazing computer animation, and even a Lesson or two, for kids
of all ages [yep, even for us 36-year-old Chicks].  </P>
<P>[STRONGER WARNING: the next paragraph definitely contains detailed movie
plotline information; if you do not wish to be "spoiled" whatsoever, skip
to "The Upshot"].</P>
<P>Lest you think that cast was too large to fit in a 100-minute movie, wait
till you hear the plotline: in a rapid-fire turn of events, Andy shelves
Woody after accidently "breaking" Woody's arm; Woody's shelf-mate, Wheezer
the not-squeaking penguin (which, unless I'm mistaken, is either modelled
after the Linux penguin, or is a character from a rather famous film
short...but I'm digressing again) is destined for the one event Toys hate:
the yard sale!  Woody accidently winds up in the "for sale" bin, from
which Toy-Collector Al--realizing that Woody might actually be a
collector's item--steals him.  This turns out to be a joyous occasion for
Jessie and The Prospector, who belong to Woody's "family"--but not for his
pals Buzz and company, who, remembering Woody's heroic rescue of Buzz in
the original "Toy Story", set off to do some derring-do of their own.  But
will Woody want to leave his new-found family, to go back to Andy, who may
have grown too old to play with dolls?  Hmmm... [end SPOILERS]</P>
<P>The Upshot:
I've taken the chance that some folks [who, obviously, will have forgotten
their Reading Is Fundamental lessons] will be upset at the audacity of my
giving so much of the movie away in the paragraph immediately
above--because it begins to address a subtle, yet very important aspect of
"Toy Story 2": it's more than just a "kiddie movie".  The attention to
detail alone separates it from your average animated cartoon, even those
that are as heavily computer-generated (TV's "ReBoot" comes quickly to
mind--RIP).  But there's something more going on here, something that I'll
address a little later.</P>
<P>For now, what's on the surface is delightful as-is.  </P>
<P>The original "Toy Story" wowed us (especially us techies) with its very
real-looking computer animation; I know I'm not the only one that had to
look more than a few times, before realizing that Andy and the other
Humans, weren't real.  Still, though there are some moments where you'd
swear they blended live-action with animation (check out Al's nose hairs
when he's passed out on the couch after his Cheesy Poofs attack), the
animation seems less precise in this movie than it was in its
predecessor's.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, though; where TS1
built the whole world of Toys and Humans as an introduction to the skill
of the technicians, if not the writers and voices, TS2 has a much deeper
tale.  I found myself wowed by the Pretty Pictures less often; here,
instead, I saw the characters.</P>
<P>And what a great bunch of characters there were!  Without going into
"spoilage" territory, I'll just say that the large cast was served well
enough, with no one character really hogging (oops, sorry Hamm!) the
spotlight the way Hanks' "Woody" and Allen's "Buzz" did last go-round;
and, again with an eye on detail, storylines that took place in TS1 are
built-upon in TS2.  But who would've thought that Mr. Potato Head would
be...[careful, Bammer; the kids might be reading]...would have a chance to
play "house" with his wife?  And remember the puppy Andy got in the first
flick?  Mmmhmm.  If I had to choose a weak spot, I'd go with Rex, who
bordered on whiny; even some of the kids in my group, started rolling
their eyes (on the other hand, my eyes got a workout when Jessie started
in with the Obligatory Disney Song--though after she was done, I was okay
about it because the song moved the story along in a somewhat necessary
fashion).  Though I can't truly recall Stiers (Major Winchester,
"M*A*S*H*") vocalizing Bullseye much, Grammer's take on Stinky Pete
reminded me exactly why I enjoy the TV show "Frasier" so much (would that
my favorite actor on that show, David Hyde Pierce, have been cast in TS2
as he was in my previously-favorite animated flick, "A Bug's Tale".  Alas,
it was not to be).  </P>
<P>By the time the movie was over, I wanted to run home and hug my "Curious
George" non-collector dolls.  Next time I see this movie--and believe me,
there'll be a next time, if only so I can catch everything I missed in
trying to take review notes--I think I'll bring old Curious with me.</P>
<P>The HUMAN Factor:
Frequent readers of my reviews know what is normally written in this
space; but something about this movie compelled me to take a different
tack this time.  Perhaps it's because I'm at a sensitive point in my life,
with a seriously ill family member in the hospital, and other stressors
that I won't bore my readers with--but there was something very
deep-reaching in this movie for me.  Between the concepts brought forth
about family, about friendship and obligations, about the silliness of
mere collecting of "treasure" and disposing of "junk" we no longer care
about, I came away from the movie with an appreciation of things I'd not
really given much thought to since I was a wee one, but that kids take the
greatest delight in.  Especially after seeing Jacob dancing his cute self
into a tizzy in front of the screen when the credits were rolling, to the
big-band-beat of Tom Scott's sax and Robert Goulet's singing "You've Got A
Friend In Me".</P>
<P>4-year-old Jacob, who I'd never met until today, made me grin so hard in
watching him dance, that I asked his parents if I could "interview" him
and his 11-year-old sister Jessica for my review.  I asked them both if
they liked the movie (yes, they both did), who their favorite characters
were (Buzz and Woody for Jessica, Buzz for Jacob; notably, their mom and I
both liked Bullseye the horse, best.  Hmmm.), and if they learned anything
from the movie.  Jessica couldn't really pinpoint anything, though she
politely agreed with my prompts; Jacob, on the other hand, was so hyper
after his delightful dance that he wouldn't stay still long enough for our
"interview", and when he calmed down for a minute, the adult in me seemed
to make him a bit less open than he was during his dance.  Which is,
basically, The Point I'm making: kids seem to have an understanding of the
sheer fun of Fun, fun for its own sake, that adults like me are simply
amazed at in watching it on a screen for an hour-and-a-half.  For me, the
layers that were behind the story in "Toy Story 2", though at first glance
they seemed to be simplistic "morals", made the story all the more deep. 
To Jacob, Buzz was cool, the music had a great beat, and he had a huge
space in which to run amuck for a few minutes.  And the funny thing is, we
were both "right".</P>
<P>Hey, call me a sentimental fool if you will, but some people pay Big Bucks
in therapy to gain that kind of insight; I figure that $7.50 (including a
box of popcorn--and lots of soul-cleansing laughs) ain't a bad tradeoff.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
I could feel the pull of the folks behind "Toy Story 2" wanting to impart
The Moral Of The Story to the audience, right near the end; by the last
scene, even my rediscovered inner-peace was starting to roil a wee bit. 
But it was a minor roil, and Jacob's Dance got me back into the smooth
groove.  So forget the gimmicky toy tie-ins (but hey, Tour Guide Barbie
had me rollin', and Mr. Potato Head's reaction...well, see it for
yourself); if you can't picture yourself going to a kiddie movie, go for
the gee-whiz animation, the inside jokes ("Father!")--look, if you just
need a reason, go because Bammer said so, 'kay? </P>
<P>"Toy Story 2" (rating: greenlight) 
I dare all the bah-humbugers out there to go pick up their favorite
non-commercial toy and remember what it was like to be a kid.  I dare
ya...I double dare ya...I double dog dare ya!  Ah, heck, just go see this
movie!</P>
