<P>   Ken Loach, whose "Carla's Song" pretty much fits in with
his traditional themes and styles, has its heart in the right
place--depending on your where you stand politically.  It's the
sort of film that would be hated by Oliver North, whose
infamous scheme funneled money to Nicaragua's Contras
during the 1980s civil war in that little country.  It will be
appreciated, though, by those who believe that the United
States should not support right-wing governments in the Third
World.  Aside from its politics, though, it has the feel of a
docudrama with improvised dialogue.  This is not the sort of
design that would win it a wide audience, but then at least
Loach is staying true to his pattern--the portrayal of poor and
working-class people who are failures in life and do self-
defeating things that drive them to madness.  If the
unpredictable actions of the hero of "Carla's Song"--a bus
driver in Scotland's commercial city of Glasgow--seem
unbelievable, you've got to realize that they are the gestures
of a man driven to good-hearted foolishness by his love of an
unlikely woman.</P>
<P>   Loach first treats us to a picture of a man with a most
ordinary profession, bus-driver George (Robert Carlyle).  He is
suspended for a week after fighting with a Javert-like ticket-
taker on his vehicle who threatens to arrest a passenger for
not paying her fare.  Though George has an affectionate,
down-to-earth girl friend, he falls instantly in love with the
passenger, Carla (Oyanka Cabezas), whom he pursues
relentlessly despite her aloofness and unwillingness to share
information about herself.  He learns, however, that she is in
Scotland as a refugee from her country's civil war.  Alone and
adrift, she has twice attempted suicide, is saved by George
who encounters her in a pool of bathtub blood, and incredibly
enough agrees to travel with her to Nicaragua to locate her
missing lover Antonio.</P>
<P>Loach's Glasgow is more realistic than Alan Jay Lerner's
depiction of the Scottish people in "Brigadoon" and his
Nicaragua is far removed from Central American tourist
posters such Costa Rica's (which claim that the country is so
romantic that even the oceans get together).  The Glasgow
workers are all hostile: the cab driver whom George's bus
barely touches is enraged; the ticket-taker treats a freebie
passenger as though she were an axe murderer; George's
boss threatens to fire him for inconsequential reasons; the
passengers on the bus whine at every bump; Carla's landlady
loudly threatens to throw her out.  But some Nicaraguans are
worse.  Loach's Sandinistas are an earthy, friendly, song-
loving group who teach literacy to the peasants. But the CIA-
backed Contras are brutal, blowing up suspected Sandinista
houses and in one case deliberately and methodically
paralyzing a man, pouring acid on his face and releasing him
to his misery.  Loach also introduces a CIA operative (Scott
Glenn) who allegedly sees the horror of his mission and goes
over to the other side.  We get the impression that the
Sandanistas would not think of stooping to the ruthlessness of
their foes--that they are as innocent as America's Black
Panthers who wanted only "to introduce breakfast programs in
ghetto schools and teach righteous behavior to its targeted
beneficiaries." </P>
<P>   Loach's politics are one-sided.  He has the right to herald
his views however much they may dismay and disillusion
those who have considered Sandinista leaders little more than
dictators bent on subverting all of Latin America into Soviet
client states.  His film, however, is marred by a largely
unintelligible Scottish dialect--it would be well served by
subtitles, as the English language spoken by the Nicaraguan
as a second language is more understandable than that of
the Scots.  More damaging is the uneasy mix of romance and
politics, making "Carla's Song" neither here nor there.  The
dialogue comes across as largely improvised making the film
too loose, even incoherent, but here Loach is nothing if not
consistent in his disregard for the traditional narrative.  Robert
Carlyle is effective, as he was in his previous films such as
"The Fully Monty" and Oyanka Cabezas's performance is
affecting though she does not have the sort of beauty that
would attract most men to her as obsessively she affects
George.</P>
<P>   With such works as "Lady, Ladybird," Loach's film about a
single mother of four with a history of abuse from males, and
"Family Life" which treats a 19-year-old woman driven mad by
societal pressures, Ken Loach is easier to respect than to like. 
"Carla's Song" keeps him firmly implanted in that ghetto.
