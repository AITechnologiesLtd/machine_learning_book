<P>"Twin Falls Idaho," by first-time directors and real-life brothers Michael 
and Mark Polish, manages to be a film about the potentially "tabloid" topic 
of siamese twins, but does not exploit this heavy subject matter. Instead, 
they have made an indie drama that is mature and discerning, about the close 
bond between siblings, and about the struggle of these two accepting people 
who have been dealt a certain hand in life, even while struggling to break 
free as individuals. If the film sometimes is a little too obvious and the 
dialogue doesn't constantly ring true, it is clear that the Polish Brothers 
have a definite talent as rising filmmakers, and due to their own closeness, 
have concocted a picture that is satisfying, solely based on the finely-tuned 
relationships that they have created between the three pivotal characters.</P>
<P>Penny (Michele Hicks) is a down-on-her-luck young woman who is broke and 
without any certain idea of where her life is headed. Sometimes prostituting 
herself for the much-needed cash, Penny winds up one evening at the scummy 
hotel room of her latest client, Francis (Michael Polish). When Francis 
enters into the room, however, and she discovers that he is one-half of a 
pair of siamese twins, Penny flees. After realizing that she left her purse 
at their place and feeling rather guilty for her unsympathetic behavior 
before, Penny goes back to the hotel to discover that Francis is actually 
very ill, and it is his brother, Blake (Mark Polish), who is the much 
stronger of the two. "How come you don't get sick too?" Penny asks, to which 
Blake replies, "Because if I got sick, who would take care of Francis?" Penny 
ultimately begins a close friendship with them, mostly because she detects an 
emotional closeness due to her own alienation from the world, and a brief 
romance appears to blossom between her and Blake, only to end with the cold, 
hard realization that it would never work out. "Maybe I'll call you when I'm 
single," Blake tells her humorously, but with an unavoidably very serious 
undercurrent.</P>
<P>"Twin Falls Idaho" is not set, as you may first assume, in Twin Falls, Idaho, 
but rather it is just one of many symbols that end up being just a little too 
heavy-handed for their own good. Symbolism is a tricky thing to do 
successfully, as it should almost always be of the subtle persuasion in which 
you have to think long and hard about certain things before you would even 
process that it was, in fact, a symbol. A recent, efficient example of this 
would be Stanley Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut," whose symbols, if you aren't 
paying close attention, could potentially fly straight over your head. 
Although not a serious, damaging criticism, "Twin Falls Idaho" is not so 
refined in this respect. For example, 'Twin' stands for the two brothers 
being twins, 'Falls' is their last name, and 'Idaho' is the name of the hotel 
they are staying in. Early on, Penny is oddly given a two dollar bill as 
change from a taxi driver, and her own name, Penny, symbolizes singularity, 
which further portrays the conflict between the idea of 'one' and 'two.'</P>
<P>Even if "Twin Falls Idaho" also is stronger in its set-up and first half, as 
opposed to its predictable, somewhat maudlin conclusion, the film is buoyed 
over to being recommended, if marginally so, because of the impressive 
performances and the one-of-a-kind relationship between the brothers, which 
is just about as believable and heartfelt as any sibling relationship has 
ever been portrayed on film. It would be too easy to group Blake and Francis 
as one being, and both are wisely given differing, distinctive personalities, 
even when they are also presented as being just about as close to one another 
as two people could possibly be, both physically and spiritually. Blake and 
Francis believe that being siamese twins is the only way they would prefer 
life, because that's the only way that they've ever known. At one point, 
Blake tells Penny, "We came into this world together, and we're leaving it 
together, too." And yet, Blake can't help but see Penny as his sort of 
savior, an understanding, virtuous light at the end of the tunnel, whom he 
starts to love, if only he could be alone with her. In one of the film's most 
powerful scenes, Blake and Francis trudge out for a night on the town during 
Halloween, the only day of the year when they blend in with everyone else and 
are accepted as "normal" people. Ending up at a party that Penny invites them 
to, they see another two attendants that have dressed up as siamese twins, 
but sadly witness them untying the strings between one another and going off 
in their own separate directions. For Blake and Francis, it isn't that easy.</P>
<P>In her film debut, model Michele Hicks is remarkable as Penny, the character 
with the most noticable arc. Hicks turns Penny into an experienced, 
hard-edged lost soul who nonetheless is extremely vulnerable to the world 
around her and unsure of what she wants to do with her life. For the story 
between the brothers to work, there had to be a third party that could come 
in and add an emotional center to the film, which Hicks brilliantly does. She 
is the one we follow most in the film, as we root for her to get out of her 
job as a hooker and redirect her path, no matter where it may take her. </P>
<P>"Twin Falls Idaho" is flawed in many ways (it also falls victim to a couple 
particular lines of dialogue that feel completely "written"), but its virtues 
also cannot be denied. The restrictive, unusual, but fully caring position 
that Blake and Francis are in is no better identified than between a touching 
exchange between Blake and Penny. "Do you ever get lonely?" she inquires. His 
answer: "For two minutes--just two minutes--each day, right after I wake up 
and right before I fall asleep, I'm alone. It's pretty difficult to ever be 
lonely."</P>
