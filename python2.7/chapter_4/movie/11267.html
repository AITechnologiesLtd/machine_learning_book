<PRE>                MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A leisurely told murder mystery and
          courtroom drama, but the real interest value is in
          the eccentric Savannah, Georgia gentry who form the
          background and texture of the story.  While not
          primarily a comedy, the (intentionally) humorous
          elements rank this among the funniest films of the
          year.  This is a film that deserved much better
          treatment from the critics.  Rating: 8 (0 to 10),
          high +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<PRE>          New York Critics: 4 positive, 13 negative, 5 mixed</PRE>
<P>     I saw this film well after most people saw it, and it still was
nothing like what I expected.  I knew it was a murder story dealing
with the well-to-do in Savannah, Georgia, society.  I expected it to be
dark and very serious and dealing with festering family relationships.
However, I do not remember a 1997 film that had me laughing so much.
The comedy elements of this film are delightful, the characters I
expected initially I would end up hating in this expose turn out to be
likable and some even endearing.  If anything the comic elements of
this film reminded me of a more smartly written MY COUSIN VINNY or
perhaps DOC HOLLYWOOD.</P>
<P>     Town and Country Magazine has wanted for years to cover the annual
Christmas party of society baron Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey) of
Savannah.  He finally has given permission and they have sent John
Kelso (John Cusack).  At least two surprises await Kelso.  One is the
number of eccentrics Kelso finds in one small space of Savannah.  One
man, for the best of reasons, gives a daily walk to an empty dog
collar. Another has several real pets on tethers, but they are all
horseflies.  The other surprise Kelso finds is that he is the stand-
offish one, and the upper crust of society are anxious to pull him into
their circle and be friendly.  The only sour note is a bitter scene he
notes between Williams and a Billy, low-class apparent houseboy.  After
the party Kelso goes to bed with more writing material than he
bargained for, and is awakened in the middle of the night to see a
fleet of police cars at the Williams mansion.  Billy had returned after
the party and had a run-in with Williams that left Billy dead.  Kelso
quits Town and Country and decides to write a book about the trial and
Savannah in general.  He also becomes a de facto member of the Williams
defense team.  He gets embroiled in more local eccentrics, mostly
friendly, and tries to unravel for himself what happened the night of
the killing.</P>
<P>     Director Clint Eastwood takes his time, and 155 minutes of ours,
unraveling the story of the hidden secrets of modern Savannah society,
many of which would have been shocking in the 1950s.  Both the type of
character Williams is and his being played by the usually sinister
Kevin Spacey makes this smart, suave, affable, yet candid man a real
pleasure to see on the screen.  John Cusack is serviceable as the
point-of-view character, but not the most watchable actor on the
screen.  The actor who surpasses expectations is Australian actor Jack
Thompson as Williams's lawyer Sonny Seilor.  Some may remember Thompson
as the supportive father of a gay son in THE SUM OF US.  Of a more
comic turn is Savannah personality The Lady Chablis whose minor secret
seemed obvious to me before the character even appeared on-screen.  I
strongly suspected just hearing Chablis's voice through a door.  It is
something of a false note when characters in the film are surprised.</P>
<P>     After I was bored by THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, I was not
expecting a lot from MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL.  Now I am
sorry I was not able to see the film until after I made my top ten list
of last year.  The film was a true unexpected pleasure.  I rate it an8
on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
