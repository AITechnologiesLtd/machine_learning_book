<P>Capsule Review:
    I'm going to go out on a limb here and call this consistently 
hilarious, and surprisingly raw (Has Soon-Yi been bringing home Kevin 
Smith videos or something?) look at the thin line between fiction and 
plagiarism Woody Allen's most satisfying film since Annie Hall. Allen, 
even more neurotic and self-loathing than usual, plays a successful 
author catching hell from both the people around him and their thinly 
veiled fictional counterparts. (The all-too-brief vignettes that we get 
to see of his writing contains some of Allen's finest absurdist humor 
since Bananas, including a Star Wars themed bar mitzvah that made me 
briefly consider changing my religion.)
    As usual, Woody is backed by some stellar talent, including 
Julia-Louise Dreyfuss, Mariel Hemmingway in a sly reversal of her 
Manhattan role, a surprisingly capable Demi Moore, and the wondrous Judi 
Davis, who once again proves that no other actor can make a 10-or-12 
letter obscenity detonate off the screen quite the way she can. Harry 
may shock some long-time Allen viewers by its sheer mean-spiritedness, 
but it's a quality that seems to have sprung the director from the 
stale complacency that's marred much of his recent work. As long as he 
can stay away from the Bergman influence for a while, this bodes well 
for The Woodman's cinematic future.</P>
