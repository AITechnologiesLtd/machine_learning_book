<P>"The Green Mile" is a good movie. At times, it is very good. But it's
not a great movie. I say this up front to try and balance out some of
the grandiose hype generated by the studio's publicity machine. For
months, "The Green Mile" has been touted as the most likely film to
sweep next year's Academy Awards. Last weekend, pre-release ads in
Sunday papers across the country upped the ante, with Paul Wunder,
Patty Spitler, Susan Granger and other notorious quote whores calling
the movie "the most extraordinary entertainment event of the year,"
"the best film of 1999," and "a masterpiece."</P>
<P>Were I cranking out a blurb for the movie, it would simply read
"'E.T.' on Death Row." Not that there's anything wrong with
that. Overall, director Frank Darabont ("The Shawshank Redemption")
does a fine job translating Stephen King's bestseller to screen,
although he focuses so much on whimsy and magic that the horrific
execution scenes almost seem out of place, which is pretty odd for a
story named after the green tile walkway leading to the electric
chair.</P>
<P>The bulk of the film takes place in 1935, centering on Paul Edgecombe
(Tom Hanks), a guard on a Louisiana death row cell block who spends a
lot of time grimacing in pain due to a severe bladder
infection. Things change with the arrival of John Coffey (Michael
Clarke Duncan), a hulk of a man sentenced to die for the murder of two
little girls. The guards soon learn that, despite his physically
imposing appearance, Coffey is a timid sort with the soul of a
child. Edgecombe discovers even more when the gentle giant abruptly
reaches out and cups the guard's crotch. The man isn't copping a feel:
Coffey is a bona fide healer. He magically absorbs Edgecombe's
infection, then releases the bad hoodoo by coughing up
computer-generated fly-like things that dissolve into the air above
him.</P>
<P>Despite clocking in at a whopping three hours, the bulk of "The Green
Mile" glides by, thanks to some extremely likable cast members,
including a cute-as-a-button pet mouse. The film drags only during the
cumbersome contemporary segments that bookend the story and when Hanks
drops by for a needless visit with fellow "Forrest Gump" veteran Gary
Sinise.</P>
<P>"The Green Mile" works best when Darabont focuses on Edgecombe and his
wife Jan (Bonnie Hunt); humane fellow guards Brutus "Brutal" Howell
(David Morse), sensitive newcomer Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper) and
seasoned vet Harry Terwilliger (Jeffrey DeMunn); and their
interactions with equally likable inmates Eduard Delacroix (Michael
Jeter - far less annoying than usual), Arlen Bitterbuck (Graham
Greene) and especially Michael Clarke Duncan, ole E.T. himself. Duncan
gives an absolutely convincing performance as the massive man-child:
he is so lovable that you want to take him home and treat him to about
a hundred Happy Meals.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the aforementioned cast is so charming that the
cell-block often feels less like death row and more like an extra
large version of Andy and Barney's Mayberry jail. When Darabont cuts
to the demented exploits of his two cartoonish villains, sadistic
guard Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison) and whacked-out prisoner "Wild
Bill" Wharton (Sam Rockwell), I half expected Aunt Bea to show up and
settle them down with some biscuits and apple butter.</P>
<P>The notion of a cozy, folksy death row seems especially bizarre during
the execution scenes. Imagine Barney Fife saying, "Come on, Otis,
we're gonna take a little stroll down the hall, hook you up to 'Old
Sparky,' then fry you like a Tater Tot," and you'll get the idea. One
electric chair sequence midway through the film is particularly
graphic and appropriately revolting. I would like to believe that
images such as these might give pause to proponents of capital
punishment, but if those folks can't grasp the concept that, if the
premeditated murder of another person is wrong, we shouldn't
collectively agree to do it, then visual aids probably won't help.</P>
<P>If you don't find the leapfrogging between homespun moments and grisly
deaths too disconcerting, then you should enjoy "The Green Mile" as a
cheesy, but absorbing fable with some dandy acting. I did, although in
the latter portions of the film, when Darabont drops the "E.T." motif
in favor of ham-handed religious allegory (John Coffey = J.C. = guess
who?), I found myself hoping for Coffey to lean out of the screen,
touch my forehead with his glowing fingertip and intone, "Go home."</P>
