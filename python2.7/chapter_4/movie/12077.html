<P>   It's a good thing that film critics have widely different
opinions on what they see. Otherwise you'd have a severe
downsizing in the industry--perhaps one national critic for the
275+ studios films introduced each year--and we wouldn't
want to eliminate the enterprise, would we?  Sometimes,
though, it seems that reviewers see different works altogether. 
Time Out New York magazine critic Andrew Johnston calls
"Sour Grapes" "very very funny," while Roger Ebert of the
Chicago Sun-Times says that it's "a comedy about things that
aren't funny." Whom to trust?</P>
<P>   In this case the Johnston-Ebert schism can be resolved by
splitting the difference.  The movie is neither very very funny
nor humorless.  In a way, it's like "The Odd Couple II" in that
you might find yourself rolling with laughter, then wondering
how you could do that for such cornball material.  Each movie
has something the other lacks, however.  "The Odd Couple II"
has crackerjack actors as the two leads; their gags are timed
perfectly.  But the material is older than they are. "Sour
Grapes" is deficient in pacing--sometimes the performers
seem to stop to wait for a laugh or perhaps even to
contemplate whether what they say really is as ludicrous as
it's supposed to be.  But the material is freshly crass.  "Sour
Grapes" is chock full of sick jokes, making light of heart
attacks, accidental castration, aneurysms, racial pigeonholing,
and especially of political correctness.  The gags come at you
thick and fast, delivered by two guys who are cousins, who
are friends, but whose temperaments are far enough apart to
create the central tension of the story.</P>
<P>   Evan (Steve Weber) is a successful New York brain
surgeon, considered one of the top men in the field.  His
cousin Richie (Craig Bierko) is a designer of sneakers.  Evan
is handsome and dates a WASP girl, Joan (Karen Sillas)
while Richie's flamboyant and goes with a gum-chewing little
bombshell, Millie (Jennifer Leigh Warren).  When the two
couples go to Atlantic City for a weekend of gambling, both
lose heavily until Richie, down to his last quarter, bums
Evan's last two coins to play the 75-cent slot machine.  When
Richie hits the jackpot (three grapes in a row), he wins the
grand price of $436,000.  Offering Evan a $1000 check he is
astounded when Evan counters with a demand for half the
money--"technically two-thirds"--because the winning grapes
came through on Evan's money.  After all, if you invest money
in a stock that skyrockets, you're entitled to the gains, aren't
you?  Though a little time is spent splitting hairs--for example,
were the two quarters a loan or an stake--"Sour Grapes" is
not concerned with matters technical or with proceeding on
unflawed logic.  The movie is a burlesque on the nature of
greed, a favorite topic of writers at least since Ben Jonson
penned the classic tale of acquisitiveness, "Volpone," and
how such cupidity can undo the best of friendships and lead
to a loss of close relationships.</P>
<P>   Some of the humor is on a level of vulgarity that might
make Howard Stern wince.  Because Evan and Richie have
staked out rival claims to the money, both advance through
the movie with anxiety leading to embarrassing
circumstances.  To relax, the double-jointed Richie is more
than ever devoted to his hobby of performing oral sex on
himself.  For his part, Evan performs surgery on an infected
testicle of a TV entertainer, Danny Pepper (Matt Keeslar),
cuts out the wrong one, and leaves the poor man fully
castrated with disastrous effects on his voice and thereby his
successful career.  (This running gag is perhaps the only one
that doesn't work, not so much because it's crude, but
because Keeslar is too outrageous to be believed or
sympathized with and because it is overly extended.)</P>
<P>   Viola Harris does a comic turn as Richie's Jewish mother,
who dotes on this son who takes such good care of her--until,
that is, the overindulged lad decides to have her killed for
reasons which are clear as you watch the movie.  The story
finds use for a Runyonesque group of homeless people, one
who acts in an embarrassing Stepin Fetchit mode, and in yet
another putdown of political correctness hones in on an
elderly couple who hesitate long and hard before telling a
black cop that the criminal being sought is also African-
American.</P>
<P>   We can't fail to mention that Larry David, the writer-director,
is co-creator of the fabulously successful Seinfeld series, a
rich man indeed who left TV to make movies like this one. His
straight-man, Steven Weber, looks strikingly like that TV
series' title character.   "Sour Grapes" may be strictly a strictly
debut accomplishment, though a solid one at that, but wait
until David really hits his stride and knocks out a series of
triumphs in the years to come.  Rated R.  Running Time: 92
minutes.  (C) 1998 Harvey Karten</P>
