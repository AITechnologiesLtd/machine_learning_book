<PRE>          LE JOURNAL D'UNE FEMME DE CHAMBRE (DIARY OF A CHAMBERMAID)
                         A film review by Julia Levin

<P>When this movie was over, I felt frustrated, almost disappointed.  But
the more I thought about Diary of a Chambermaid, the more I came to
admire it.</P>
<P>The themes of obsessive desire, inhibitions imposed by society and
ridicule of conventional bourgeois values dominate Buñuel's work, and
Diary of a Chambermaid is no exception to that.  Unlike some of Buñuel's
most surrealistic films (L'Age d'Or, Un Chien Andalou, Belle de Jour),
Diary is fairly straightforward.  No one but Luis Buñuel can combine so
brilliantly sexuality, perversity, and humor against the backdrop of
fascism's in France in the early 1920s.</P>
<P>Celestine (Jeanne Moreau), a chic, elegantly dressed Parisian, finds a
position of chambermaid in a suburban manor.  Her frustration with
province -- "The countryside is always a little trite" -- soon proves to
be a rather premature conclusion, as she discovers her boss' shoe
fetishism, among his other peculiarities.  Curiously, Celestine finds
Monsieur Rabour's weakness harmless, if not attractive.  Moreau has one
of those sophisticated faces that give away so much yet reveal so
little.  With a wicked flicker in her eyes and a smirk playing at the
corners of her mouth, Celestine learns very quickly how to wrap everyone
around her finger.  She is dignified and calm with frigid and stingy
Madame Monteil, and playfully dismissive of her husband's sexual
flirtations (Michel Piccoli is wonderful at portraying the spineless,
trapped husband).  Her poise, body language, and facial expressions,
especially in the scenes when she discovers Monsieur Rabour's private
shoe stock, are delightful to watch, and the restored B&W print makes
the best of it.</P>
<P>When Celestine suspects Joseph, Monteil's servant and a devoted
right-wing bigot, of a murder, she postpones her return to Paris and
decides to investigate the murder on her own.  Despite the fact that
Celestine goes so far as to frame Joseph, her coming on to him is an
example of a truly Buñuelian touch -- ambiguity and perversity.  Is she
really attracted to the sadist (she was horrified once while watching
him slaughter geese) and a murderer, or is she out for the revenge, or
perhaps even both?  We'll never know, and that's why I adore Buñuel so
much -- for him there is always so much more in people than mere
characterization.</P>
<P>The rise of nationalism and anti-Semitism in France provides Buñuel with
another chance to exhibit his radical, vitriolic, and atheistic view of
the world he finds so decadent and devoid of morality.  After all,
Joseph gets away with the murder and Celestine, an impetuous spirit
anticipating the aroma of justice, turns out to be no more than a shrewd
opportunist selling herself short to become another Madame Monteil -- a
bored bourgeois wife.</P>
