<PRE>Meet Joe Back
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>** (Out of ****)</PRE>
<P>What would you do if you were informed that you only have a very limited time
to live? This would be the ultimate life crisis. Some would spend their
remaining days putting their affairs in order to make life easier for their
families. Others would work on getting right with their god. Certainly some
would jump into that familiar river Denial and ignore the situation.</P>
<P>The most common answer is that one would do all those things that he had been
putting off. Tell a loved one how much she means to you. Express to your
friends the importance they've had in you life. Explain to your children the
lessons you've learned so maybe they won't have to make the same mistakes.
Visit Bali like you've always wanted to. Of course the reality that we all do
have only a limited time rarely sinks in and we continue in our work-a-day
world oblivious to the ticking of the countdown.</P>
<P>Media mogul William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) is approaching his 65th birthday
and is sure he is about to die. He has it from the ultimate authority. Death,
himself, delivered the news over dinner.</P>
<P>Parrish's daughter Susan (Claire Forlani) has had better luck. Involved in a
loveless relationship with Drew (Jake Weber), a business partner of her
father's, she meets a handsome stranger (Brad Pitt) in a downtown coffee shop.
There's an instant connection and they almost drown in each other's eyes.</P>
<P>That evening, she's shocked to find the man at her family's table. Parrish
introduces him as "Joe Black", a new associate. Unbeknownst to the rest, Death
has taken over the young man's body to spend some time on earth and try to
discover what being human is all about. He and Parrish have a deal. The Grim
Reaper will delay harvesting him as long as he acts as tour guide to our reality.</P>
<P>What Joe doesn't count on is falling in love with Susan. Although the two
seemingly don't have much in common -- she's a doctor from a very wealthy
family, he's an immortal force of nature -- they find themselves drawn together.</P>
<P>Director Martin Brest ("Scent Of A Woman") has taken a potentially 
fascinating look at coming to grips with mortality and the nature of
supernatural beings and ignored what should have been the film's strong
points. Loosely based on the 1934 "Death Takes A Holiday", there's promise in
the concept but it doesn't deliver.</P>
<P>The film's biggest sin is its length. At three hours, the admittedly
satisfying ending comes about 60 minutes after it should have. Virtually every
scene goes on longer than it needs to. Entire sub-plots could have been
eliminated without detracting from the movie.</P>
<P>Mostly what Parrish does during his last days is defend his company from a
hostile takeover. Headed by Evan, his board of directors ousts him from the
firm and he must fight to regain control of the business he's built. The
corporate takeover doesn't add much to the story except a couple brief
witticisms about death and taxes.</P>
<P>As part of their deal, Parrish can't explain who Joe really is to his business
cronies. In the real world if a handsome young stud suddenly showed up
constantly hanging out with a rich older man and they both refused to tell
what was going on, there would be an obvious guess as to their relationship. I
was surprised that this suspicion was never voiced.</P>
<P>The movie is filled with one-trick ponies. Forlani plays Susan as a nervous
hesitant woman, especially in the love scenes with Bill. She does a great job
at it, but about the fifth time it happens, you'll find yourself impatiently
tapping your fingers on the armrest.</P>
<P>Pitt's Death is understandably an enigma, but one that makes little sense. At
times Joe is childlike. He doesn't know what food is about. He can't figure
out how to tie his tie. He can barely walk. Think Peter Sellers in "Being
There". At other times, he delivers the insights that you'd think an entity
who has spent forever observing mankind would have.</P>
<P>The relationship between Susan and Joe is occasionally touching, but not very
believable. After all, she is in love with the guy she met at the coffee shop,
not this unnatural being inhabiting his body. As clueless and cold as he is
when they meet again, it's difficult to understand what she sees in him.</P>
<P>There are some well-done bits.The last minute of Joe and Susan's first meeting
comes out of left field and is a great cinematic moment.</P>
<P>The one time that the overly long scene work is when Susan seduces Joe into
discovering the garden of earthly delights. It takes forever for them to
undress each other and it's a slow heat coming to a full burn. Forlani has an
offbeat beauty that can be enticing at one moment and uninviting at others.
Not happening to be of the sexual persuasion to fully appreciate Brad Pitt's
physical attributes, I can only mention the involuntary "oohs" and "aahs" from
the women in the audience when his shirt comes off.</P>
<P>Hopkins is wonderful and it might be worth seeing the film just for him. He's
a grand actor, but at times he seems to be in a room by himself, reacting to
things that we can't see.</P>
<P>The movie misses the boat. There are interesting ideas to explore. Susan's
older sister Allison (Marcia Gay Harden) has spent her life trying to please
her father. Her husband Quince (Jeffrey Tambor) is the most human of the bunch
but gets little screen time. Surely Parrish has something better to do after
finding out he's about to die besides spend his time in the boardroom. But
these aspects get slighted in favor of far too much time spent on corporate
wheelings and dealings and Joe and Susan who get dull fast.</P>
<P>After what seems to be five or six hours into the film, you'll begin to wonder
whether Death is coming for Bill Parrish or this movie.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for over 23 years and isn't answering
the door if there's a guy with a big scythe out there. Let Death contact him
at <A HREF="mailto:Redman@indepen.com">Redman@indepen.com</A> like everyone else.)</P>
