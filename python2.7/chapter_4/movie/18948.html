<P>Mike Figgis' The Loss of Sexual Innocence is a movie so confusing, so 
boring, and so poorly done that the Better Business Bureau should step 
in and stop any poor, unsuspecting citizen from wasting their money on 
this sad excuse for a film.</P>
<P>The premise of this piece of junk production that is attempting to pass 
itself off as art is nearly unrealizable. Figgis (best known for his 
critically acclaimed film, Leaving Las Vegas) takes several small 
stories involving Nic (John Cowey at age five, George Moktar at age 
twelve, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers at age 16, and Julian Sands at adult age), 
the film's central character, and interweaves them with the biblical 
tale of Adam (Femi Ogumbanjo) and Eve's (Hanne Klintoe) descent from the 
Garden of Eden. There is no apparent rhyme nor reason to the order of 
assembly of these stories, nor any true connections other than a common 
loss of innocence, notably not always of a sexual nature.</P>
<P>Making the plot even more difficult to follow is the film's resemblance 
to many silent picture of the early 1900's, opting for a delightful 
musical score in place of dialogue. The little speech in this film is 
insignificant to the plot, or so you assume because it is almost 
entirely drowned out by the background music.</P>
<P>The Loss of Sexual Innocence leaves its audience asking themselves 
"Huh?" Not only is the viewer totally disillusioned, but it is works 
like this that are constantly making the line between art and junk ever 
more blurry. Perhaps a more fitting title would have been "The Loss of 
Artistic Innocence."</P>
