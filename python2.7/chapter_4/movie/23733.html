<P>   A forlorn Harry Belafonte once sang, "My heart is down/ My
head is turning aroun'/ I had to leave a little girl in Kingston-
town."  The aki, rice and the fish are still nice in Jamaica's
capital but the island paradise of Belafonte's memories has
greater problems than broken hearts in Chris Browne's "Third
World Cup."  Browne takes us inland to Kingston, to
neighborhoods of the island that few tourists see or care to,
given the penchant of Americans and Europeans for the
beaches of Montego Bay and Ocho Rios.  "Third World Cop"
conveys memories of Perry Henzell's 1973 cult favorite "The
Harder They Come"--about a country boy who goes to
Kingston to make it as a singer but whose record climbs the
charts only after he turns to a life of crime.  That film, starring
Jimmy Cliff, is credited almost single-handedly with launching
the reggae craze in America.  Browne's new film also bears a
generous and bouncy reggae soundtrack, particularly the
lilting "We Run Tings" performed by Red Dragon, and a few
numbers from Grammy Award winners Sly Dunbar and
Robbie Shakespeare who also produced the soundtrack.  But
despite its incredible popularity back home in Jamaica where
ten percent of the adult population has purportedly seen the
box-office blockbuster, as a police drama the movie's most
recommendable feature is its unintentional comedy.</P>
<P>   North Americans will probably want to compare "Third
World Cop" to Gordon Parks's "Shaft," which came out two
years before Perry Henzell's classic.  Browne gets some
calculated grins whenever he contrasts crackerjack, Shaft-like
law enforcer Capone (popular Jamaican actor Paul Campbell)
with his plump and bumbling Keystone-Cop partner Floyd
(Winston Bell), but the real fun of the movie comes from the
simplistic, amateurish shootouts. The story is for the most
part so unambiguous that unlike even the great James Bond,
Capone is never injured nor is there ever a hint that he may
be up against forces he cannot control.  As the reggae song
goes and as Capone himself intones, "We control
things...things don't control we."  The central thrust of the tale
is the struggle between a good man, Capone, and his
long-term boyhood friend who has turned to a life of crime,
Ratty (Mark Danvers).</P>
<P>   The story opens as Capone, stationed with the Port
Antonio police force, is interrupted by thugs in the midst of a
sexual liaison.  After Capone demonstrates that he is not
much into due process but is perfectly willing to set a
previous jury ruling of "not guilty" right, Capone is transferred
to the capital city of his youth, Kingston, where a man of his
vigor is needed to break up a gun-running scheme.  Learning
that the man he had once treated like a brother, Ratty, is
involved with local crime lord Wonie (Carl Bradshaw), he
seeks to make Ratty an honest man again, a guy whose
talent with kids could make him a fine social worker.  For his
part, Ratty tries to bring Capone into a partnership with him,
promising Capone great deal more money than he could ever
make with the Jamaica police department.  =</P>
<P>   The struggle for men's minds takes a back seat to feverish
gun play in which Capone, outnumbered and outgunned (he
carries two pistols while the forces of evil brandish Uzis),
easily overcomes the hoodlums who have set up shop in one
of Jamaica's many shantytowns.  The obligatory romance
theme involves Capone's childhood sweetheart, Rita (Audrey
Reid--who comes across more as a transsexual than a
femme fatale)--and is underdeveloped.  =</P>
<P>   We can safely presume that the box office popularity of
"Third World Cop" in its home country has more to do with
the popularity of its star performer and with the accent on
action than with any sort of dramatic complexity.  For those
not familiar with Jamaican patois, the movie is subtitled but
only for those parts of the screenplay that would be as
incomprehensible as "Trainspotting"-style Scottish.  The
picture is suffused with washed-out colors that make it
appear as though it were transferred from video, which
doesn't detract too much considering that the locales used as
background for the gunplay are more generic than Jamaican.</P>
