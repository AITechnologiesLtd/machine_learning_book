<PRE>                              NOTTING HILL
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Julia Roberts *is* Julia Roberts – almost – in NOTTING HILL, a
well-crafted romantic comedy from the geniuses behind FOUR WEDDINGS AND
A FUNERAL.</P>
<P>     The deceptively simple plot begins when uber-famous film star Anna
Scott (Roberts) winds up in William's (Grant) book shop on Notting Hill,
something of a British cross between a pre-Disney Times Square and a
Moroccan street market.  After William accidentally dumps orange juice
down Anna's front, an on-again, off-again, on-again, off-again, on-again
love affair blossoms.</P>
<P>     Using Anna's (and Julia's) celebrity as a catalyst, the plot is
propelled along by run-ins with the press and paparazzi, the duplicity
`required' of a big film star, secret love affairs on the side, world
travel, and buttinsky PR flacks.  It's amazing that Anna comes off as
likeable at all, but with EveryBrit Grant as her foil, it's hard not to
fall for her in the end.  Of course.</P>
<P>     So far, sounds like an everyday comedy – but NOTTING HILL wins its
real points in the details.  Director Michell's London is every bit is
real as a Beatles album.  And, big surprise, it's the cast of completely
unknown supporting characters that really carry the film.  Special kudos
to Rhys Ifans as Spike, William's pig of a roommate, who carries large
chunks of the film on charm (or lack thereof) alone.  I give him an
early Best Supporting Actor nod.</P>
<P>     If you like lighthearted romances, NOTTING HILL is for you.  The
women in our audience (who comprised about 90% of it) would seem to
agree.  I can't complain, either.  I mean, it's Julia Roberts.  How can
you not fall for her?</P>
