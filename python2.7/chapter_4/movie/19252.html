<PRE>                     SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT
                         A movie review by Joe Barlow
                             (c) Copyright 1999</PRE>

<PRE>        "This movie has warped my fragile little mind."
                -Eric Cartman, "South Park: Bigger, Longer and
Uncut"</PRE>
<PRE>        The above quote from Eric Cartman could easily function
as
a one-sentence review of the new animated film in which he
stars.
I never thought I'd see the day when a cartoon about
potty-mouthed
children, a sex-obsessed cafeteria cook, and a piece of singing
feces
became not only acceptable television programming, but a
national
phenomenon as well.  God bless America.</PRE>
<P>        Since debuting on Comedy Central in 1997, "South Park"
has
continually pushed the envelope of good taste and challenged
the
conventional idea of what is and is not appropriate for
television.
The battle has not been an easy one: since the very first
episode
was aired, the network has been besieged by letters from angry
parents, religious organizations, and nearly every political
group in the country, all demanding the immediate cancellation
of
the series.  But the proof is in the Snacky Cakes: Trey Parker
and
Matt Stone, the show's creators, have demonstrated that
poo-poos and
profanity can not only entertain the masses, they can also mean
big
merchandising dollars.  Now they're gambling that they can take
the
premise (and its profits) to the next level.</P>
<PRE>        "South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut" is ninety
minutes of
nearly continuous profanity, vomiting, sexual innuendos and
fart
gags.  It's crude, horrifying, shocking, disturbing... and the
funniest movie I've seen since 1993's "Clerks."  Moral
Majority,
kiss my ass.</PRE>
<P>        In the small "redneck mountain town" (according to the
opening song) of South Park, Colorado, life is quiet and
peaceful--
idyllic, even.  But the town's solitude is challenged when a
new
film opens at the local theater: "Asses of Fire," starring
Canada's
Terrence and Phillip (a comedy duo whose schtick revolves
entirely
around their ability to fart on cue).  Four of the local
children
(Eric Cartman, Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski and Kenny McCormick)
sneak in to see the R-rated movie, and are quite taken with the
new vocabulary words contained therein.  As is the way with
children,
they promptly begin showing off their new arsenal of colorful
phrases
at every possible opportunity.</P>
<P>        The community is outraged that four pure, innocent
children have been corrupted by the film (apparently they don't
watch the "South Park" TV show), and soon the president
declares
all-out war on Canada, the bastion of evil responsible for the
offending movie.  Terrence and Philip are sentenced to die, and
the boys hatch a plan to save their idols.  Even more is at
stake,
however: Kenny discovers that if Terrence and Phillip are
killed,
Satan and his lover, Saddam Hussein, will gain dominance over
the
world.</P>
<PRE>        No matter what you may think of the convoluted plot,
one has
to admire the skill that has gone into constructing it.  "South
Park"
is one of those treasured rarities: a movie that actually
enriches
the TV show upon which it's based.  Once again, envelopes are
pushed
to the breaking point (the MPAA initially gave the film an
NC-17
rating), and contemporary topics are brilliantly satirized:
look for
sly jabs at Jar Jar Binks, racism, conservative America, and
the MPAA
itself... not to mention the Broadway musicals from which the
film
draws much of its inspiration.</PRE>
<P>        Yes, that's right, the film is an all-out musical
affair,
with lots of singing and dancing.  Fear not, however: unlike
those
in recent Disney features, these tunes are actually memorable,
managing to stay imbedded in your head for days afterwards.
There's
"Mountain Town," the bouncy opening number which extols the
virtues
of small-town life; the inspirational "What Would Brian Boytano
do?";
the villainous "Blame Canada" (which recalls the positively
evil "Be
Prepared," from "The Lion King"); and a frantic rendition of
the toe-
tappin' "Kyle's Mom's a Bitch" (an "It's a Small World"-type
sing-
along), which is guaranteed to offend absolutely everyone.</P>
<PRE>        The irony is that once you get past the language,
"South
Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut" has a more uplifting message
than
much of the tripe Disney has drummed out in the last ten years.
It
stresses that we are one planet, and we should treat each
other's
beliefs with respect and tolerance.  It also reminds us that
children
are people too, and deserve to be treated as thinking
creatures, not
something that needs to be coddled and shielded from the big
bad
world.  Hear, hear.</PRE>
<PRE>        Is the movie actually 'good'?  That's totally
subjective:
after all, how does one rate the artistic merit of a
surprisingly
graphic love scene between Satan and Saddam Hussein?  Or of
watching
a little boy burn himself to death by attempting to light his
own
flatulance?  All I can say is that the movie made me laugh
harder
than almost any other I've ever seen, and I was actually a bit
moved by the strangely sweet yet unapologetically ridiculous
final
scene.  Admittedly, the pace and premise do begin to grow a bit
stale by the time the final twenty minutes roll around, but
it's a
minor drawback: there's so much to see and hear in the first
hour
that I don't think any fan could possibly be disappointed.  If
you
think you've got the stomach for it, you'll be hard-pressed to
find
a more daring comedy.</PRE>
<PRE>        Oh, and Kenny dies.</PRE>
<PRE>                     RATING: *** out of a possible ****</PRE>
