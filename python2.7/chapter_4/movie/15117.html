<P>     Judith Moore Nelson (Holly Hunter) is a woman sort of on the verge of
a nervous breakdown.  On the surface she appears to have it all, from a
professional career as a nurse to a spacious Manhattan co-op apartment.
Underneath, she's still reeling from her husband (Martin Donovan) leaving
her for a younger woman.  Alone in her apartment, she fantasizes about
committing suicide; sitting alone in a restaurant, she fantasizes about
being invited into the company of two friendly women.  Living single has
left Judith frazzled, overwhelmed and unsure what her next step in life is
going to be.</P>
<P>     No, it's not the plot for an episode of "Ally McBeal," though it sure
seems like it at times.  Writer and first-time director Richard
LaGravenese sets up LIVING OUT LOUD as a wistful comedy about adults
reaching a point in their lives where they wonder if it's too late to make
up for their bad decisions.  In addition to Judith, we meet Pat (Danny
DeVito), the elevator operator in Judith's building and a man with
problems of his own.  Divorced and coping with the recent death of his
young daughter, Pat is a big dreamer perpetually just one step ahead of
complete financial ruin.  When Judith actually strikes up a conversation
with him one evening and the two begin spending time together, we get to
see the power of simple companionship for people who need a break from the
company of their own thoughts.</P>
<P>     At least initially, it appears that LIVING OUT LOUD is going to
balance the stories of its two main characters, and that's when the film
is at its best.  DeVito's performance may be his best screen work to date,
finding the romanticism at the heart of Pat's irresponsibility.  Playing a
decent guy is one of an actor's toughest challenges, but DeVito makes Pat
a genuinely decent guy who's also an interesting guy.  With Queen Latifah
added to the mix as a singer with unique relationship issues, there's an
earthy counter-point for Hunter's nervous energy.</P>
<P>     The importance of that counter-point is only truly evident when it's
gone.  At 93 minutes, LIVING OUT LOUD feels strangely incomplete, perhaps
because Pat vanishes into the background in the final half of the film and
Judith takes over completely.  Unfortunately, a little of Judith goes a
long way.  While it's easy to sympathize with her situation, it's much
harder to sympathize with her, because -- to put it bluntly -- she grows
annoying to spend time with.  Holly Hunter is a very talented actress, but
here she acts with mannerisms instead of finding the character's emotional
center.  She plays Judith like an alien investigating the world -- an
interesting choice for a character in existential crisis, but one that
underlines things rather than letting them unfold.  In nearly every scene,
you can see Hunter's acting muscles bulging and flexing.</P>
<P>     LIVING OUT LOUD still manages to be somewhat satisfying, largely
thanks to DeVito and LaGravenese.  For a writer making his first venture
into directing, LaGravenese shows a solid cinematic sensibility, though he
does also let the camera linger on people delivering dialogue.  It's
wonderful to find a writer actually writing for grown-ups, and some of his
tart lines and absurdist fantasy situations are fun in bits and pieces,
but ultimately LIVING OUT LOUD is a frustrating experience.  It could have
been an off-beat love story, or even an off-beat friendship story -- in
either case, a story about two people who help each other stop living
inside their dreams and start living out loud.  Instead, it's primarily
about the contributions other people make to one quirky woman finding
herself.  All that's missing is a computer-generated baby dancing to
"Hooked on a Feeling."</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Holly McBeals:  6.</PRE>
