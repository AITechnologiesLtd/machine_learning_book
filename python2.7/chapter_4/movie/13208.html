<PRE>THE TRUMAN SHOW
Rating: **** (out of four)
PG, 1998
Directed by Peter Weir. Written by Andrew Niccol.
Starring Jim Carrey, Ed Harris, Laura Linney.</PRE>
<P>Those who have grown accustomed to Jim Carrey as a one-note Johnny
specializing in funny faces and fart jokes might be surprised to see him in
THE TRUMAN SHOW, one of the better films of the past few years, portraying
Truman Burbank, a man who has lived his entire life on national television.
He lives inside the largest studio ever constructed, set up to resemble a
small island town, unaware that everyone around him is an actor and that
cameras are hidden everywhere. "The Truman Show," created by an enigmatic
producer named Christof (Ed Harris), is on the air twenty-four hours a day
and is a worldwide hit. Christof and his actors all seem to hold Truman in
high regard, even as they manipulate and deceive him.</P>
<P>Truman's a nice guy and a bit of a goof, partly because he's been raised in
an idealized, "Leave It To Beaver"-style community. He lives a pleasant,
stable life with his "wife" Meryl (Laura Linney), and has to deal with only
the mild conflicts and difficulties designed by the show's producers. He's
nearing thirty years old, however, and he's starting to wonder what life is
like outside the island, and he still sometimes pines for a strange woman
he met in college who started to tell him a bizarre story when she was
suddenly whisked away by her "father," who claimed she was schizophrenic.
(In fact, she was trying to tell Truman that his life was a television
show.)</P>
<P>"The Truman Show" is television, not reality, and as a result the other
actors sometimes have to pause awkwardly in the middle of dialogue for
product placement, and there is the occasional technical glitch. The show
has remarkably efficient damage control: when a stage light falls from the
sky and lands outside Truman's house, for example, he hears a radio report
shortly afterward that a malfunctioning airplane had just flown overhead
and shed a few parts. But now that he's starting to question his place in
the world, these things are starting to bother him a little more. He starts
taking a few risks, like jumping out in the middle of albeit slow traffic
and finds that, lo and behold, all the cars instantly stop to let him
through. His attempts to leave the island are continually thwarted through
various "coincidences." He's beginning to think that there is some sort of
secrecy or conspiracy surrounding him, and, of course, he's right.</P>
<P>Most of Andrew Niccol's screenplay focuses on Truman's gradual realization
that things aren't what they seem and Christof's increasingly desperate
attempts to keep him convinced of the deception. Carrey turns in an
excellent performance, convincingly capturing both Truman's initial
golly-gee-whiz naivete and his nervous insistence on knowing the truth,
while never losing sight of the character's essential charm and niceness.
There is perhaps one instance of a hastily executed plot development, but
other than that, the screenplay flows nicely, and director Peter Weir does
a particularly good job of finding the right mix of irony and genuine
empathy for Truman's scripted emotional moments.</P>
<P>But what really makes THE TRUMAN SHOW work is all the side issues raised by
the screenplay. At one level, it's a satire of television, in that the
viewers and producers talk about Truman as if he really were nothing more
than a character in a TV show, and some of his little daily problems are
the artificial, contrived stuff of soap operas. It can also be read as a
shot at the current fad of "reality" programming that has brought us the
likes of "World's Scariest Police Chases" and "When Animals Attack."
Equally interesting, however, is the issue of how we simply accept the
reality into which we are born. There are times when I found myself
wondering why Truman didn't start getting suspicious earlier, but the small
bits of weirdness like the supposed crumbling airplane may well just be
part of everyday life as far as he's concerned. Niccol's screenplay also
addresses the human rights aspect rather well. He allows Christof to argue
that it is the outside world with all its violence and unrest that is sick
and twisted rather than his scheme to keep Truman in the studio and on
camera, yet still ultimately sides with the small "Free Truman" movement
that seems to have sprung up.</P>
<P>Simply put, THE TRUMAN SHOW has everything that makes for an excellent
film: an engaging lead performance, a screenplay with solid
characterization and plotting and interesting subtexts, and controlled
direction that adds to the personality of the film without getting in the
way. Some of the buzz surrounding the film has labeled THE TRUMAN SHOW as
the Movie of the Decade. I don't know if I'd go that far, but as of
mid-June 1998, it's at least the Movie of the Year.</P>
