<P>=93Eyes Wide Shut=94, the final theatrical effort of late visionary direc=
tor
Stanley Kubrick, transports the viewer through a dark, fascinating
tunnel of sexual voyeurism. Like a thought-provoking amusement ride
through a towering Gothic cathedral, Kubrick=92s closing bow plumbs the
innermost depths of the human conscience. =93Eyes Wide Shut=94 is a rare
psychological thriller that had my eyes feverishly affixed to the screen
throughout most of the 2 hour, 40 minute running time, all the while
pulsating with the type of technical brilliance associated with
Kubrick=92s name. Even the most simplistic conversation between character=
s
is given Grade-A treatment by the director - the lighting, camera
movement and background score all helping to sustain the impeccable
atmosphere.</P>
<P>To me, that is one of Kubrick=92s most impressive achievements: the
ability to create and maintain atmosphere. =93The Shining=94 is a stunnin=
g
example of his exquisite talent to mesh characters, plot and
surroundings into a total cerebral experience. =93Eyes Wide Shut=94 is
another one of these dream-like experiences. Upon its initial release,
critics and audiences stood at a decidedly mixed consensus. Some more
naive viewers, presumably unfamiliar with Kubrick=92s craft and brand of
filmmaking, went in anticipating more of a prototypical Tom
Cruise/Nicole Kidman romance vehicle. In turn, the somber, artsy
approach most likely drove them away sickened with humdrum monotony.
Others found the experience to be vague and meandering - posing the
suggestion that perhaps the concept and material was not worthy of the
great director=92s touch. Personally, I will offer high praise for the
visually and intellectually consuming =93Eyes Wide Shut=94. It may not
warrant a =91Classic Kubrick=92 stamp of approval, but =93EWS=94 is a hau=
nting
piece of visionary artwork, and certainly a worthy finale in a
phenomenal filmmaking saga.</P>
<P>Cruise and Kidman play Bill and Alice Harford, a wealthy New York couple
who, at first glance, seem to be at the peak of happiness in their
lives. We join Bill and Alice on the Eve of a party they are rushing to
attend, hosted by Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack), a long-time friend of
the family. We watch curiously as Alice succumbs to the charm of an
older businessman, and as the two embrace each other on the dance floor,
openly discussing the meaning of marriage and whispering other
adulterous notions. Bill, meanwhile, is being tempted by a pair of
flirtatious girls who obviously want to lure him into a more private
sector of the ongoing party. More than a trifle vague, but interesting.
All of this subtle sexual cavorting leads to Alice, who - under the
influence of pot - reveals that she once considered an affair with
another man. Bill, confused, begins to prowl the moonlit streets to
search for some kind of redemption.</P>
<P>These events unspool into a surreal, engrossing exploration of
character, and it is here that Kubrick=92s visual genius really tightens
its grasp. Bill, a physician, encounters an old doctor-friend turned
musician (Todd Field) who reveals the secret of an masked underworld
gathering. After a brief stop at costume shop owned by a strange old
kook (Rade Serbedzija), Bill makes tracks for the bizarre sex convention
hoping to.... well, we don=92t really know. I imagine you=92re all famili=
ar
with this part. Yes, it=92s the notoriously controversial orgy sequence.
To escape the wrath of the dreaded NC-17, Kubrick was forced to trim
roughly 1 minute of gratuitous fornication and obscure a number of
protrusive body parts using shadows of onlookers (digitally added during
post-production). Some critics, like Roger Ebert, were quick to express
their disapproval of this MPAA intervention - arguing that Kubrick=92s
intended version would never be seen. These critics do make a valid
point.</P>
<P>But I want to skip easy jabs at the MPAA and focus on the film as it
stands. Two of the most captivating moments in =93Eyes Wide Shut=94 occur=</P>
<P>during simple character interaction. The first is the conversation
between Cruise and Field in a darkened bar. Every word, every syllable
is emphasized, and the incredible mood projected by such a customary
moment is definitive of Kubrick=92s magical ability to enrapture the
viewer over his career. The second moment is a chilling conversation
between Cruise and the convention leader, which just oozes atmosphere
and style, with lucid background music and tantalizing camera angles.
Although alone it may resemble a cat walking across a piano, the score
is of fundamental support. =93Eyes Wide Shut=94 is almost perfect from a
technical standpoint, and you already know what editing factor would
make it totally perfect.</P>
<P>No one other than Cruise and Kidman is given enough screen time for
register, but playing a pair of well-realized characters, the real-life
couple delivers. At times, our emotional link to the Bill character
wavers, and Kidman=92s vocal slurs occasionally become grating. =93EWS=94=
 is
also overlong, and some of the dramatic stuffing lacks real substance.
What I=92m saying is that =93Eyes Wide Shut=94, written with unstable
fluctuation between certain characters and events, is not the classic
cinema of =932001: A Space Odyssey=94 or =93A Clockwork Orange=94. But, a=
s he
places the viewer under his spell from minute one, we realize it may be
a long time before the realm of movie-making sees another rare genius
like Stanley Kubrick.</P>
