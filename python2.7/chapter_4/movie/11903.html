<P>BASQUIAT, is a perfect example of what a film maker can do, when he cares
about what he is doing, rather than just making a film that is supposed to
mean something. The touches, the care, the details, and the totality of this
film, is what makes this so endearing and important. Never mind the artist
even.</P>
<P>The film itself, though, is as good as it gets about the artist, and while
it obviously does not approve of the artist's way, it never stops to make a
judgement about his lifestyle, and here is the beauty of it all. As Jean
Michel says " if I take it all out it will all become boring ... "</P>
<P>And this is what the film does so well. Wether the performances are close to
the originals or not is another question, but it is hard to fault the
attitudes that some people take here. New York does get its share of shit
for art, that becomes known as "art", and although Basquiat and Warhol were
not major
intuitive players, they did add a certain amount of freshness and weirdness
to the period that helped push the buttons, and expand the art business in
that area, and eventually around the world.</P>
<P>But it was not new. And it was not tremendously original. Jean Michel
Basquiat, did however have to offer something that others did not. He did
have an artistic perception that others around him did not, not even Andy
Warhol. And the film does go a bit out of its way to show that Andy Warhol
is really
not the artist that he was made out to be, and lacked the resolution to be
the intuitive force that Basquiat DID have.</P>
<P>Few films stand out in the art world. Generally films like this that deal
with music do better in film. Films about writers tend to be harsh to stick
with as the narratives get tiresome. But films about art, are even harder,
because it is necessary that one embroider the work into the film, and this
is not easy. The best of these, LA BELLE NOISEUSSE, is four hours long, but
it is riveting, and the main subject IS the art, and the main people
involved in it, the painter and the model. With Basquiat, he is his own
model through his feelings, and this allows for a nice place for the film to
come from.</P>
<P>Few films take care of things like this one does... it is excellent. And
should be seen. It's a shame that it did not get a wider release, because
the film has excellent music and visual imagery to really blow off most star
wars dilettantes.</P>
<P>4.5 out of 5 GIBLOONS
