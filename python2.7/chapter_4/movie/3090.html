<PRE>                           STAR TREK: GENERATIONS
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  The next First Generation "Star
     Trek" film is also the first Next Generation "Star Trek"
     film.  A physical phenomenon that does nasty things to
     time (and even worse things to logic) is loose in the
     universe.  Kirk gets to meet Picard and the two fight a
     world-chewing villain.  This one is a feast for the eye
     and a famine for the brain.  Rating: high -1 (-4 to +4)
     [This review contains some spoilers of the early parts
     of the film.  Spoilers of later parts of the film are
     saved for an afterword.  You have to excuse me for not
     taking "Star Trek" very seriously.  Of late I find I am
     just a "Babylon 5" sort of guy.]</PRE>
<P>     There are two kinds of "Star Trek" fans.  There is the kind who
like action and special effects and the kind who like a well-thought-
out science fiction idea.  The most popular "Star Trek" films are the
ones aimed at audiences who want to turn off their minds and just have
a roller-coaster ride.  In a small unofficial poll the best-liked "Star
Trek" film is STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN.  That film is built
around a completely absurd plot device called the "Genesis Effect" that
seemed to create and instantly evolve life on barren planets, moving
suns in place as needed.  The film did have good action and special
effects, however, and many of the fans were not troubled by the film
being built around a poorly-conceived premise.  STAR TREK GENERATIONS
should please the people who liked WRATH OF KHAN and should irritate
the set of fans who were irritated at that film.  This time the story
is built around something called the "Nexus."  This thing is described
as a scientific phenomenon, but as used in the film it is pure pixie
and fairy dust.</P>
<P>     As the film opens, Captain Kirk and other members of the Corpulent
Space Corps are guests aboard a brand new Enterprise under the
fledgling Captain Harriman.  The ship is not really provisioned to
travel, but then this maiden voyage is intended only as a three-hour
cruise.  We all know, however, that the Enterprise's enterprises never
run smoothly.  This Enterprise is unexpectedly called to a rescue
mission.  Things do not go well for Harriman and most embarrassing of
all for the new captain is that old Captain Kirk is, for the first time
in his career, sort of killed.  Unfortunately, Spock is not along to
help Kirk through that trying first death.  Meanwhile, 78 years later,
the Next Generation crew is involved with a similar rescue.  Curiously,
they seem to rescue one of the same people that the earlier Enterprise
rescued.  He is one Dr. Soran (played by Malcolm McDowell), an inhuman
non-human with his own plans for the weird temporal phenomenon that
chews planets, attacks Starships Enterprise, and especially likes to
suck up captains.</P>
<P>     This is a film with a plot that goes in for quantity rather than
quality.  One film that is less than two hours long involves two
Enterprise crews, renegade Klingons, enemy Romulans, an interstellar
temporal thingee, a sailing ship, Jean-Luc Picard's family, a Christmas
tree with odd ornaments, a new chip that greatly modifies Data, two
different Enterprises on the brink of destruction, Captain Kirk's long
lost love, some very funny-looking eggs, and a mad scientist.  That is
just a bit too much for everything to gel.  What works the best are the
acting--which most of these people can do in their sleep--and those
special-effects action sequences.  The space battle scenes are always
impressive on the big screen, though hardly original.  One sequence
involving the Enterprise and the planet Veridian III actually is
breath-taking.  Not all the visuals work out so well, however.  When
blown up to ten feet across, Data's make-up looks not enough like the
covering of a machine and way too much like clown's greasepaint.  But
in general the look is more polished than the script deserved.  To have
so many nice special effects lavished on the film and yet to have such
a poorly thought-out script is a very negative indication of the
filmmakers' opinion of their audience.  Unfortunately the "Star Trek"
people probably do know their audience only too well.</P>
<P>     This film is a triumph of style over substance.  It is far more an
exercise in sci-fi than science fiction.  I give it a high -1 on the -4
to +4 scale.  I have to be honest and say that I walked out of the
theater thinking this film was at least decent, but as the film started
to gel in my mind and I realized some of the gaping holes in what I had
seen, I realized this script had far too many problems to get near a
camera.</P>
<P>     SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER</P>
<P>     I would like to say a little more about why this thing called the
Nexus has no place in a science fiction film.  The Nexus seems to have
attributes usually ascribed only to Heaven.  It is a physical
phenomenon that seems to pluck people out of our universe and somehow
plop each person right into the best of all possible parallel universes
for that person.  There the castaway has things like a ready-made
family.  Picard has a wife and children who are not at all surprised to
see him suddenly appear.  Kirk, who has been in the Nexus for 78 years,
seems to have just arrived.  Kirk and Picard apparently manage to
escape the Nexus only by wishing to be elsewhere.  (Perhaps they
clicked their heels together and said "There's no place like
Veridian.")  The concept is great for fantasy fans but has little to do
with physics or any other science.  It is an idea full of
contradictions that seems to have been contrived only to give Soran a
motive for his crimes--so it is a nice place to be--and to have Kirk
and Picard come together in time--so it is a temporal phenomenon.  Room
is certainly left for a sequel since the interstellar transtemporal
space ribbon is still zapping around out there were no one has gone
before.  Of course leaving room for a sequel in a "Star Trek" film is
redundant.</P>
<P>     Besides the foolishness of the main premise--and the fact that 47
people are pulled out of the heaven-like Nexus and 78 years later the
Federation seems to have forgotten that the Nexus exists--there are
other problems in the script.  In one sequence Picard is crawling only
very slowly through the hole in the rocks and is fired upon.  There is
no way he could have moved fast enough to get out of the way of the
explosion, yet he sustains not even a scratch.  A rocket fired from
Veridian III to its sun seems to hit its target in seconds.  In fact,
based on timing we see, the filmmakers apparently thought the sun wasa
small ball less than a mile overhead--this is a giant step backward in
cosmology.  The bug in Geordi LaForge's glasses is still broadcasting.
Will he ever discover it?  All these touches seem speak more of the
first draft of a script than of a finished product.  To have so many
people working on the film and not to have anyone asking basic
questions like "how do the captains get from the Nexus back to Veridian
III?" indicates to me a very cynical attitude of the Star Trek
organization--and this is the product of an organization, not just a
few script-writers--toward science fiction fans.  They have taken the
attitude that their audience cares about visuals and not intelligence
or even the basics of continuity in scriptwriting.</P>
