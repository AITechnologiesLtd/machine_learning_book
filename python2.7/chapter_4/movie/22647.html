<PRE>FELICIA'S JOURNEY (Artisan Entertainment)
Directed by Atom Egoyan</PRE>
<P>         Director Atom Egoyan specializes in movies that create slightly
unsettling atmospheres, and "Felicia's Journey" is no exception. As the
story (adapted from William Trevor's novel) gently unfolds, it's like
having one of those disturbing dreams in which everything seems normal
but feels a little askew, almost if as some horrible tragedy is lurking
just around the corner. "Journey" is very much the work of the same man
who previously gave us the jarring "The Sweet Hereafter" and "Exotica."</P>
<P> In the film, Bob Hoskins plays a quiet, cultured little man
named Joseph Hilditch, who lives by himself in a sprawling old house and
works in a factory, overseeing a staff of cooks who prepare lavish
lunches for the workers. Hilditch's mother Gala (played by the dirctor's
wife Arsinee Khanjian) was a popular French chef back in the age of
black-and-white broadcasts and she sometimes invited her little boy on
the program to serve as comic relief. It appears he's still mired in the
1950s, if his choice of home decor and music are any indication. When
his ancient food processor finally gives out, Hilditch simply walks into
a spare room and pulls out another identical model from among the dozens
he's stockpiled.</P>
<P> "Food must be served by caring hands, not by machines,"
Hilditch tells a salesman trying to pitch him a line of vending machines
that would put his culinary team out of work. "It makes us feel loved."
At home, he creates elaborate gourmet meals for himself, while watching
tapes of his mother's show.</P>
<P> Felicia (Elaine Cassidy) is also alone in the world, having
been shunned by her self-righteous father after becoming pregnant by
Johnny (Peter McDonald), a young man who left their depressed Irish town
to look for work in England. Utterly guileless and unaware she's
probably been used, Felicia follows him.</P>
<P> Both characters experience flashbacks in which they suffer at
the hands of domineering parents -- Felicia's dad calls her a whore in
public and Johnny's aloof mother (Brid Brennan) ignores her pleas for
information on where Johnny went, while Hilditch reflects on being
treated like a prop on the set of Gala's show --  although their methods
of processing this abuse are completely dissimilar.</P>
<P> You may correctly suspect the lives of Hilditch and Felicia are
destined to intersect, but the beauty of "Felicia's Journey" lies in its
refusal to adhere to a predictable path. Every time we think we know
what's going to happen, the story spins off in a curious new direction;
only in its unconvincing climax does it go wrong.</P>
<P> Speaking in a deliberate, understated voice and using a minimum
of gestures (when he's not cooking, his hands are often buried in his
pockets), Hoskins makes Hilditch a truly unnerving character, someone
who's outwardly sedate yet seems to have ugly secrets drifting around in
the back of his mind. Although Felicia's naive and unquestioning nature
might have made her a fairly drab heroine in the hands of a less
talented actress, Cassidy brings her tenderly to life and makes her
plight heart-wrenching. James Sanford</P>
