<PRE>                             SLEEPY HOLLOW
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               CAPSULE: This is much more a tribute to than
          an adaptation of the Washington Irving story that
          has become a children's Halloween classic.  SLEEPY
          HOLLOW is an exquisitely sepulchral horror
          adventure involving witchcraft and a head-hunting
          Hessian headless horseman from hell.  This poetic
          and beautifully realized film surpasses all of
          director Tim Burton's earlier work but THE
          NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS.  Rating: 8 (0 to 10),
          high +2 (-4 to +4)  Spoiler warning: the review is
          followed by some comments on the film intended for
          people who have already seen the film, one of which
          could be a serious spoiler.</PRE>
<P>     One of the greatest horror films ever made is Edgar Ulmer's 1934
THE BLACK CAT.  It is a delightful black comedy, an exercise in mordant
horror starring both Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi in their first film
together.  It claims to be based on the classic story by Edgar Allan
Poe, but one can search for hours through the film and not find
anything that Poe would recognize.  One could hardly call it a
retelling of the Poe.  It is a little easier to find elements of
Washington Irving's "Legend of Sleepy Hollow" in Tim Burton's new
SLEEPY HOLLOW, but it is amazing to see how many people are calling
this a retelling of the Irving.  It most certainly is not.  Instead the
story has been disassembled and many of the pieces have been used in
telling the story of what might be a supernatural killer bringing
sleepless nights to the little New York State village of Sleepy Hollow
in 1799.</P>
<P>     Ichabod Crane (played by Johnny Depp) is an enlightened police
detective and reformer from New York City.  He is excited about the
coming of the new century.  (He calls it a new "millennium," indicating
that there must have been a bunch of people working on this film who
did not realize that new centuries and new millennia do not always come
at the same time.  So not everything scary about this film is
intentional.)  Though Crane himself is afraid of the sight of blood--
and seemingly even his own shadow--he believes that new scientific
methods will revolutionize police detective work.  He even has invented
for examining evidence a set of instruments that would do David
Cronenberg proud.  However, his methods are not welcomed by the local
constable and burgomaster (cameos by Alun Armstrong and Christopher
Lee).  Crane is sent by carriage upstate to investigate some recent
mysterious killings in Sleepy Hollow.  Three decapitation murders have
taken place in the little village and Crane is to report to prominent
citizen Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon) and begin his investigation.
And if scientific methods can be employed, so much the better.</P>
<P>     Physically, Depp is all wrong to play the gangly Ichabod Crane.
However the queasy detective shows great internal dissonance when the
strength of his enlightened ideas push against his physical and
psychological weaknesses.  And he tries to hide his distress, not very
successfully, with his cold-fish demeanor.  The strain of this police
case eventually is really too much for him and he finds he is cracking
under the strain.  It is a delightful change to have a vulnerable hero
who has self-doubts and weaknesses.  Perfectly matching the spirit of
the film is a terrific Michael Gambon.  He must have spent hours in
front of a mirror achieving just the perfect facial expression for each
of his scenes, frequently conveying at the same time disdain, disgust,
and fear.  His daughter, Katrina Van Tassel, is Christina Ricci who in
spite of her buxom appearance still looks a lot like Little Wednesday
from THE ADDAMS FAMILY.  Perhaps that is a mold she will take a long
time breaking.  Miranda Richardson quietly plays Van Tassel's wife, but
is clearly the source of most of Van Tassel's strength.  When the
Hessian is given his head he is played by Christopher Walken who
appears to be having a grand time of it.  Rumor has it that Tim Burton
is so introverted that he wants to deal with as few new actors per film
as possible.  As a result many of his actors get used over and over.
Familiar faces include Depp, of course, but also Jeffrey Jones and Lisa
Marie, all from Ed Woods's entourage.  There are more familiar faces
including Michael Gough, Ian McDiarmid, and Casper Van Dien.</P>
<P>     Tim Burton is as much a visual stylist as a director.  His
particular visual style is recognizable and goes back to his amateur
film FRANKENWEENIE.  In this film he uses that style a little less, but
it is still recognizable.  The visual aspects of this film are, in
fact, its greatest attraction.  This is a nice film to look at.
Frequently large mattes are used to create scenes, but in a departure,
they are not intended to be realistic.  Instead they are either obvious
paintings of idealized nature or of smoke-filled scenes of villages
setting a tone for the film.  Sleepy Hollow is an area of mists and
darkness.  The few sunny scenes are memories of the past and again at
the end of the film when normality returns.  Burton intentionally lifts
images from classic horror films.  The film opens with an image of
dripping blood spattering borrowed from the Hammer film (THE HORROR OF)
DRACULA.  Later an image is borrowed from THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM.</P>
<P>     Washington Irving might not have thought much of SLEEPY HOLLOW.
But for a horror film, it is poetic and surprisingly pleasurable.  As
it rarely does when I am watching a film it occurred to me at about the
halfway point that I was really enjoying the film.  Even with all its
faults, this film is fun.  I give it 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high
+2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     SPOILER WARNING... SPOILER WARNING... SPOILER WARNING...</P>
<P>     There are several points I would fine-tune with this film
including: 1) The birdcage on the disk is always filmed as if it is
right side up including at the end when it is filmed from both front
and back.  Seen from the front the cage and bird should be upside-down
if the user sees it right side up.  2) The ending of the film is
completely given away much too soon by the voice of the witch in the
woods.  Anyone who saw the very good TV-movie MERLIN will have heard
the same false voice used extensively.  3) Toward the end of the film
a clue is presented and interpreted.  Crane says that a dead body will
not bleed.  And starting a short time after the death of the body that
is true.  But if the filmmakers were aware of that fact, why did they
have the earlier pregnant victim's body bleed when it was dug up?  They
should have known it could not do that.</P>
