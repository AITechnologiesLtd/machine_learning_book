<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A sitcom type of nonsensical comedy, one that has abolutely no bite.
Everyone in it is a cartoonish character, with the satire nonexistent
and the comedy coming in a forced and heavy-handed manner derived from
its physical comedy. It is such a forgettable film, that I forgot it 3/4
of the way through.</P>
<P>The film's one-idea joke is about a misunderstanding, as 2 of the 3
escaped convicts wind up stealing a homosexual couple's R. V. and find
themselves in Happy, Texas, expected to put on a beauty pageant as a gay
couple. The jokes are coming at the expense of the convicts being cast
as homosexuals, as the locals in this small-town accept them because
they want the young schoolgirls to win the contest so that they can go
for the first time to Dallas for the state regional finals.</P>
<P>The film opens on a Texas chain gang, where a smart, suave, con artist,
Harry Sawyer (Jeremy Northam), and a dumb, crude, goofy, car thief,
Wayne Wayne Wayne Jr. (Steve Zahn) get into a brawl with a mean-spirited
murderer, Bob Maslow (M. C. Gainey) and when transported back to the
prison for solitary confinement, their van overturns, allowing them to
escape.</P>
<P>Wayne and Harry go off chained together and steal the R.V., and soon
find that they are in Happy, Texas, and that Sheriff Chappy (Macy) is
there to escort them to town to see the judge and arrange for their job
payment. The humor comes about as the convicts find they stole the
vehicle of the gay couple David and Steven, who are professional beauty
pageant organizers hired to prepare the grade-school girls for the
Little Miss Fresh-Squeezed competition.</P>
<P>If there is anything amusing about this film, which is doubtful, it
comes at awkward moments for the two convicts, who are trapped into
being perceived as homosexuals. There is physical humor as Wayne acts
crass and unsure of himself around the children and their teacher Miss
Shaefer (Illeana). He attempts to choreograph their show numbers and has
no clue how to relate to the kids; while Harry's character gets caught
in a romance with the single bank president, Josephine McClintock
(Ally), who goes by the name of Jo. Their romance seemed artificial,
sort of like filler stuff for the fluff story. Not to be undone by
Harry, Wayne has an equally unconvincing romance with Miss Shaefer. And
to make things fit the formula pattern of this very soft satire, Chappy
and Harry start dating. This romance was just as unconvincing as the
others. The convicts are caught in awkward tender moments, which is
where the comic effort is always going. If this were on TV, where it
belongs as a sitcom, there would be canned laughter during the mock
romantic scenes.</P>
<P>The third escaped convict comes predictably back into the picture,
forcing the boys to go through with their plans to rob the bank, even
though the boys have a change of heart about robbing the bank, seeing
how everyone in town is so nice to them. This bank robbery is the final
clumsy attempt to draw laughs out of its unconvincing story, but this
robbery scene was too witless to watch without cringing. The film lacked
the art of making these situations funny...it didn't know how to draw
satire out of situations that were set to be mocked. The actors were
pleasant... but they just weren't too funny or believable.</P>
