<PRE>                                SECRETS AND LIES
                       A film review by John Schuurman
                        Copyright 1997 John Schuurman</PRE>
<PRE>Written and Directed by Mike Leigh.</PRE>
<P>"O what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive!" Sir
Walter Scott first wrote it --  Mike Leigh and his superb movie have
shown us the truth of it. </P>
<P>This is (appropriately) a complicated movie; guile and duplicity have
made it so. The story unfolds with evidence of the tendrils and shoots
of deceit cast all about and we need to have our wits about us as we
watch. The film does not make unreasonable demands on us but the
attuned observer will quickly become aware that there is a lot of
submerged hurt lying around. The main action of the movie is to take us
through a marvelous and simplifying exercise in unearthing the pack of
lies that make for pain. From cemeteries and slums; from secrecy and
deceit the hurt is nudged and beckoned to the surface and in the end we
say with the characters, "This is the life ain't it?" "Yeah....Yeah." </P>
<P>Ironically, the integrity of it all is the most compelling thing.
Writer/Director Leigh has drawn his characters so fully and so candidly
that he makes us forget it is a movie about lies. Indeed, the great
accomplishment here is that we forget that it is a movie at all. I
can't remember a film that called me into it quite so thoroughly. </P>
<P>It is a movie that shows people all fouled-up with misunderstanding --
of both their own and others doing -- slowly coming to terms. Despite
their inherent dimness of soul, they slowly turn up shiny. </P>
<P>Me too. It was something like a earnestly said and deeply felt service
of confession and reconciliation in a church service: I felt clean as I
walked away. </P>
