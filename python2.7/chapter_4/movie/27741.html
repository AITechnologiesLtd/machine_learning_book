_Down_to_Earth_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        There's no denying that Chris Rock is a funny man.  On the
stand-up stage, he blazes, eliciting many a large laugh with his fierce
mix of rage and joy.  But one thing few would ever say about Rock is that
he's a great actor.  This is not to say that he's an especially bad one,
for he has been effective in small roles in _Dogma_ and _Nurse_Betty_. 
It's just that one doesn't exactly equate "lead movie star" with him, and
his flat starring vehicle _Down_to_Earth_ doesn't do anything to change
that perception.</P>
<P>        Part of the problem is that he is never quite able to completely
shake off his stand-up persona.  Granted, on screen he displays the same
charismatic presence he has on stage, but the barking line delivery and
cadences of his stand-up delivery also carry over, which makes it
difficult to separate Rock from the character he's supposed to be
playing.  _Down_to_Earth_, a remake of 1978's _Heaven_Can_Wait_ (which
itself was a remake of 1941's _Here_Comes_Mr._Jordan_), makes an obvious
attempt to ease the transition by casting Rock as Lance Barton, a
stand-up comic.  This, however, just makes matters worse; whenever Lance
takes the stage and does his act, we see Rock (who happened to co-write
the script and recycle some of his own material), not the character of
Lance.</P>
<P>        The plot, as it is, has struggling stand-up Lance suffering an
untimely death in a traffic accident; apparently, this was a mistake, so
an angel named King (Chazz Palminteri) quickly gives Lance another
body--which, unfortunately, is that of just-deceased  billionaire Charles
Wellington.  Lance negotiates this to be a temporary arrangement, but he
has second thoughts when he meets activist Sontee (Regina King), whom
Lance manages to successfully woo while in the body of the much-older
white man.</P>
<P>        Rock and King manage to generate some charm together, but their
romance is often lost amid easy fish-out-of-body jokes (there is not only
one, but two, scenes of Lance bumping to rap music, forgetting he's in
the form of a portly old white man) and boring subplots, in particular
one revolving around Wellington's scheming wife (Jennifer Saunders) and
her lover (Greg Germann), who also happens to be Wellington's right-hand
man.</P>
<P>        _Down_to_Earth_ was directed by Chris and Paul Weitz, but this
film doesn't display any of the antic spirit of their last film,
_American_Pie_--not even during the stand-up sequences that should be
comic high points.  But just at fault, if not more, is Rock, who
fashioned a less-than-ideal project for himself.  When someone wants to
see a Chris Rock comedy, one wants to see him R-rated unleashed--not so
much in terms of profanity than his intelligently biting adult humor.  In
_Down_to_Earth_, not only has his edge been smoothed over, so has his
smarts.</P>
