FILM FREAK CENTRAL
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/~billchambers/">http://www.geocities.com/~billchambers/</A> )</P>
<P>starring Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon, Joan Allen, Jeff Daniels
written and directed by Gary Ross</P>
<P>PLEASANTVILLE is a kind of inverted Truman Show: its two protagonists
are aware they are stuck in a TV show, but everybody around them isn't.
This is a film that in its own peculiar way lectures against
conformity-life without individuality as a (here, literally and
figuratively) black and white world.</P>
<P>Maguire (The Ice Storm) stars as David, the World's Biggest
"Pleasantville" (a fictitious "Father Knows Best"-like family values
sitcom from the fifties) fan. One lonely Friday night, at the start of a
"Pleasantville" marathon, he and his rebellious sister Jennifer
(Witherspoon) are zapped into the program by a mysterious TV repairman
(Don Knotts-whose cameo garnered loud applause at the recent Toronto
International Film Festival premiere). The siblings must live out the
lives of characters Bud and Mary Sue Parker, son and daughter of
housewife Betty (Allen) and office man George (Fargo's William H. Macy).
David knows every episode by heart, so he finds it easy to blend in;
careless Jennifer is intent on taking Pleasantville by storm: within
hours of her arrival she steals a basketball player's virginity and
lectures her naive mother about the birds and the bees. Her impulsive
actions trigger a most unusual effect on the gray landscape: flowers,
trees, even people begin to look more vibrant than usual. At first,
Maguire scrambles to undo Witherspoon's ‘mistakes', but when the love
bug bites him unsuspectingly, he joins the Pleasantville revolution.</P>
<P>Ross's (co-screenwriter of Big) beautifully-photographed (by John
Lindley) and scored (by Randy Newman) directorial debut is a flawed but
fascinating motion picure that recalls the fantasies of Robert Zemeckis
(Back To The Future, Forrest Gump). The movie demonstrates how a
mini-society can be corrupted by, frankly, the introduction of
free-spirited sex. Those who discover passion in Pleasantville turn to
colour; the town's traditionalist mayor Big Bob (the late J.T. Walsh)
outlaws "coloured people", resulting in street riots and political
protests. But the movie wants to have its cake and eat it, too: David
gives an impassioned, convincing speech that champions self-exploration
and experimentation.</P>
<P>PLEASANTVILLE's most problematic character is Macy's: as a chauvanistic
father and husband utterly dependent on his wife's homecare (he doesn't
even know how to heat up leftovers), we actually feel sorry for him when
she ditches him for golly-gee soda shop owner Daniels. It's not George's
fault he is a prototypical man-of-the-house fifties TV character. Ross
simultaneously resents and sympathizes with him. (The ending feels a bit
rushed, glossing over exactly what will become of George and others like
him.)</P>
<P>PLEASANTVILLE touches on giant issues (racism, book burning) but is a
bit too PG-13 "pleasant" in its execution. I was never quite sure what
Ross was trying to say, but his film is a finely acted,
thought-provoking experience nonetheless.</P>
