<PRE>                          A CHORUS OF DISAPPROVAL
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>One can pretty well expect that if it is something Alan Ayckbourn has
written, it is going to be a great farce. In fact, the play on which
the film is based did win several awards.  One can only assume that
something happened in the transition to film. For one thing, sets with
hilarious goings-on in different rooms are a hallmark of Ayckbourn
farces.  Seeing the film with the mobility of a movie camera where the
set no longer is an integral part is possibly what is missing in the
film.</P>
<P>Initially released in 1989 it was withdrawn because of a legal
disagreement between the producers.  Because the film does not depend
on any particular date, however, the fact that it is now being released
seven years later does not spoil the story in any way.  It is a kind of
timeless farce with  Dafydd Ap Llewellyn (Anthony Hopkins), as a
tyrannical, hysterical monster of a director of an amateur production
of THE BEGGARS OPERA. Into this town of Scarborough, England comes Guy
Jones (Jeremy Irons) who has been sent by his employer to do some work
there.  Guy is of the opinion that he was sent there because of a
computer glitch.</P>
<P>Guy, a shy man who has recently lost his wife, sees an ad in the local
newspaper announcing casting of amateurs for a play.  He thinks this
may be what he needs to alleviate his boredom.  However, much to his
innocent surprise, every woman in the cast as well as others who just
live in the town are trying to get him into bed.  This includes Hannah
(Prunella Scales of Fawlty Towers fame) who is the sex-starved wife of
Dafydd. Then there is the swinging couple who like to have different
partners to break the monotony of married life. (Jenny Seagrove and
Gareth Hunt) in a very funny episode involving Guy, a woman friend, and
the swingers.</P>
<P>While the comedy is handled flawlessly, the film slows down
considerably with the insertion of a sub-plot involving Guy's company
and the greedy townspeople of Scarborough.</P>
