<PRE>Only for Real "Troopers"
(A film review of "Starship Troopers")
by Timothy Scott        </PRE>
<P>        Okay, so I admit maybe I'm getting old, but the best advice I can 
give for anyone thinking of seeing "Starship Troopers" can be summed in 
two words - Ear Plugs.</P>
<P>        Normally, IUm a tireless advocate of THX quality theaters with 
state-of -the-art digital sound.  But this film had me wishing I had my 
remote control. You don't so much watch "Starship Troopers" as survive 
it. By the end, youUll likely feel as battered and bombarded as the wounded 
troopers themselves.</P>
<P>        Somewhere amidst the carnage is a message from director Paul 
Verhoeven that we are a society addicted to violence, as capable of 
inhumanity as the creatures we so gleefully destroy.  But you'll probably 
miss that as you dodge the endless bullets, razor claws and
dismembered body parts hurling at you from every direction.</P>
<P>        Verhoeven has made another in the long line of technically 
brilliant "theme park" films we've come to expect BEFORE Labor Day.  I 
suppose by turning up the camp factor Verhoeven has convinced himself 
that this is social commentary. Sure, if you look hard enough you can find 
meaning watching the Coyote trying new ways to kill the Road Runner. 
Sorry Paul, I'm not impressed.  This film made me feel like I'd been 
dropped inside a video game during an earthquake. Of course, I mention 
video games on purpose because I know this film is coming to a Nintendo 
near you. Frankly, that might be more fun.</P>
<P>        Of course, such video game graphics won't compare to the computer 
generated images seen in this film. As supervised by Phil Tippet  of 
Jurassic Park fame, Industrial Light & Magic do their usual first rate 
job with the effects.  Visually, I haven't seen a film
with this many eye-popping wonders since "The Fifth Element." 
Interestingly, both these films only make me wonder how incredible it 
would be to see effects like these attached to a real story.  Let's just 
hope George "Skywalker" Lucas knows what I'm talking about.</P>
<P>        So, what about the story, you ask? Well, it centers around the 
hormonal tendencies and macho posturing of about a half dozen new 
recruits, some of whom will live and some of whom will die a grisly, 
horrible death.  Succeeding as a trooper is basically advancement by 
attrition. If you stick around long enough for the commanding officers to 
die, sooner or later they put you in charge. </P>
<P>        The cast is made up of unkown actors because, let's face it, the 
bugs get top billing here (they must have a killer agent).  What's most 
remarkable about the actors is what perfect physical specimens they are. 
Their performances are so stiff you'd think the tongue that supposed to 
be in cheek got sucked out by aliens too.  Although, in fairness, 
straight is exactly how this material should be played. If anyone of 
these characers winked at the audience at all, the whole premise would 
collapse.</P>
<P>        The film is certainly not as derivative as say, "Independence 
Day."  Verhoeven seems to prefer borrowing from himself. The clever news 
sequences for example are very reminiscent of "RoboCop" (not to mention 
the incessant bloodshed).  The best moments occur when the film is 
clearly not taking itself seriously as it parodies the WWII newsreels and 
propaganda films trying to recruit young men and women to sign up for 
Federal (read: Military) Service.  </P>
<P>        By joining up, they can become "citizens" - valued members of 
society honored for their commitment to protecting the human race above 
all else. The youth are taught in school that being a citizen is a badge 
of honor making it easier for them to enjoy privleges like going to 
college, entering politics or obtaining a license to get pregnant.
These parodies of fascism arenUt new, but in this kind of film it comes 
across as rather witty.</P>
<P>        Unlike "RoboCop" "Total Recall" or even "Showgirls", "Starship 
Troopers" will not be remembered years from now.  Despite its 
bludgeon-like impact, none of the perfomances stand out. In fact, even 
the big, nasty bugs seem bland. In it's attempt to satirize overkill, 
thatUs exactly what it becomes.  The Audience is Listening...just not as 
well as we used to.</P>
