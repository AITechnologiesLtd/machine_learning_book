<P>   During the New York City blackout of the late seventies,
some bad things were going down.  Stores were looted, car
windows were smashed, people were getting mugged. 
Something good came out of the experience, though. All TV's
were kaput in my own apartment building, and people
climbed down the stairs, candles in hand, to find out what
was going on.  Neighbors met neighbors for the first time as
we looked through the glass entrance to the building and
marveled at the absolute darkness of the adjacent streets,
streets rendered even darker than we had known them to be
during those rare total solar eclipses of the sun.</P>
<P>   The solar eclipse which is the central character of Eric
Mendelsohn's small and slight film, "Judy Berlin," serves
partly as metaphor for the obscured childhood dreams of the
folks of the Long Island community of Babyon and in part as
a marvel of nature which brings their repressed feelings to
the fore.  In this debut feature of Mr. Mendelsohn--which was
screened appropriately at a recent Hamptons Festival--some
strange and wonderful things happen during that single day.
But this picture is no high-budget vehicle for a Paul Thomas
Anderson, whose "Magnolia" similarly, in a period of a few
hours, brings together estranged people freighted with
feelings of guilt but adds a dramatic payoff of Divine will:
thousands of frogs rain down on one area of the San
Fernando Valley.  Instead, Mendelsohn's feature film is a
story of epiphanies realized by a small group of these
ordinary Long Island who are hit by a recognition of their
long-contained feelings.</P>
<P>   At the center is the mother of the title figure, Sue Berlin
(Barbara Barrie), a buttoned-down, divorced elementary
school teacher who relates well to her well-behaved pupils
and is about to come to grips with her feelings for her boss,
Arthur Gold (Bob Dishy), a frustrated principal.  Sue's
daughter, Judy Berlin (Edie Falco), about to leave for
Hollywood to try for an acting career, is a bubbly woman of
32, full of misguided optimism about her possibilities, who is
brought back to Earth in a chance meeting with Arthur Gold's
son depressed and unsuccessful son, David (Aaron Harnick)-
-a failed film-maker who is still living at home with his dad
and his mother, Alice (Madeline Kahn).  </P>
<P>   While the most amusing scene in the movie takes place as
a small group of tourists watches a dramatized replay of what
the town was like in 1857 (with Judy Berlin playing the neatly-
costumed farmer), we are concerned principally with two
relationships sparked into life: one between Arthur Gold and
the divorced Sue Berlin; the other between the nebbishy
David and the spirited Judy.  While we suspect that both
connections will fizzle out like the clouding over of the sun at
12:48 that afternoon, Mendelsohn has afforded us a slice of
life, and of equal importance, has affirmed his faith in the
beauty of suburbia.  </P>
<P>   "Judy Berlin" goes against audience expectations in that it
is uncritical of life outside metropolitan areas.  The picture
appears to have been made by a man who was brought up
on a quiet, tree-lined street in a relatively small community,
who had little desire to go to "the city," and who has a great
affection for the suburban way of life.  While the picture
poses as a modern Chekhovian tale--the silences and pauses
more meaningful than the spoken dialogue--Jeffrey
Seckendorf's cinematography is hard to take.  The entire
screen is enveloped in shadows, disastrous especially for a
black-and-white movie, giving what is purportedly an
optimistic yarn the ambiance of a cynical noir film.  While Bob
Dishy is super as a man who has been ground down by his
yammering wife and who takes comfort in a brief hug with
one of his teachers, there is not enough drama to make the
story watchable.  "Uncle Vanya" this is not.  Rather this is the
sort of chamber piece that would fit perhaps in a 50-seat off-
off-Broadway theater but is lost on the large screen.  </P>
<P>Not Yet Rated.  Running Time: 96 minutes.  (C) 1999
