<PRE>200 CIGARETTES
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * 1/2 out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>>From the title of 200 Cigarettes, one might assume that it is either a
propaganda film from the tobacco lobby, or a comical entry for the
Guinness Book of World Records.  However, in actuality, the film turns
out to be a threadbare ensemble comedy, struggling to be an 80s
nostalgia film, and failing.  In fact, the 200 of the title could be a
reference to the number of minute subplots in the film, each of which
holds about as much substance as a wisp of cigarette smoke.</P>
<P>The film is set on New Year's Eve, 1981.  Monica (Martha Plimpton) is
hosting a party, and the film cuts back and forth between many of her
invited guests as they meander their way across New York City, slowly
making their way to her apartment.</P>
<P>There's not really a main plotline, but the subplot with the most
prominence is that of Lucy (Courtney Love) and Kevin (Paul Rudd). Kevin
has just painfully broken up with his girlfriend, Ellie (Janeane
Garofalo), and Lucy wants to cheer him up by taking him to the party.
However, as the night progresses, it is obvious that a romance is
budding between the two.  But, can Paul recover from his break-up in
time to notice Lucy?  Or is this match not meant to be?</P>
<P>The search for love is common throughout most of 200 Cigarettes' myriad
subplots.  For example, a clumsy, but earnest girl (Katie Holmes), can't
help falling in love with a love-phobic lout (Jay Mohr).  Or, two lost
Long Island girls (Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffman) discover love in
the most unlikeliest of places.  The emcee for the evening is a
disco-friendly cab driver (Dave Chappelle) who manages to meet just
about everyone that night.</P>
<P>The main problem with 200 Cigarettes is a common one to the ensemble
comedy.  Very few of the film's subplots actually work, and the film
spends far too little time with them.  Instead, we are constantly
reunited with barely recognizable characters we care little about in
situations both tedious and contrived.</P>
<P>The actors in 200 Cigarettes aren't able to help matters much. Christina
Ricci is buried beneath her screech of a New Yawk accent. Ben Affleck
wanders aimlessly through his scenes as a highly desirable bartender.
Jay Mohr's character inexplicably takes a 180 degree turn halfway
through the film.  Katie Holmes is lost amid some uninspired bits of
slapstick.  Paul Rudd and Courtney Love are nearly the only appealing
ones in the film, but there is far too little of them to be spread
around.</P>
<P>The film is set in 1981, but that seems to be more of a marketing ploy
than an actual setting.  There's nary a nostalgic bone to be found in
this body. Sure, barely a moment goes by without an early 80s song
floating by... but, if you're wise, you'll buy the soundtrack, and skip
the movie.</P>
<P>200 Cigarettes is not an absolute disaster.  It's more like a crowded
party in which there are only one or two interesting people.  Awkward,
overcrowded and mostly boring...it's not a party to remember.</P>
