<PRE>        "From what I've seen of the rich, you can have 'em," snorts the
lawyer to his client.</PRE>
<P> "I do," the client replies, through a carnivorous smile.</P>
<P> The lawyer is Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz (Ron
Silver). The client is Claus von Bulow (Jeremy Irons), a man who had one
of the very richest, an heiress named Sunny (Glenn Close), who now
lingers in an endless coma. When Dershowitz and von Bulow first meet,
Claus is seeking someone to help him with his appeal after being
convicted of attempted murder. Dershowitz, despite considerable
reservations, takes the case.</P>
<P> Director Barbet Schroeder's delectable "Reversal of Fortune"
reconstructs the infamous von Bulow scandal and makes it more mystifying
than ever by presenting it as a real-life "Rashomon." As a result,
Claus' defenders may question their position after seeing the film, but
his critics may have some moments of self-doubt as well.</P>
<P> The marriage of Sunny and Claus is played mostly for
extraordinarily dark comedy, a marathon of extracurricular affairs,
pill-popping and mind games. While Sunny was usually portrayed in
newspaper accounts as a meek, frail romantic taken for a ride by gigolo
Claus, Close's portrait is far deeper and more colorful. On one hand,
she's Sunny the Valium Zombie, a paranoid hypoglycemic whose meals
consist mostly of sundaes and cigarettes and who celebrates Christmas by
washing down various drugs with multiple cups of eggnog. But Close isn't
entirely unsympathetic to the woman; when Sunny begs Claus for love,
then insists she likes to sleep with the window open in mid-winter
because she finds the chill "reassuring" she brings a sad resonance to
the stereotype of the poor little rich girl.</P>
<P> Speaking of chilliness, it's a credit to Irons that he somehow
manages to make Claus' icy facade alluring and compelling. His frozen
heart is sheathed in a suave, even-tempered exterior that slowly wins
your trust.</P>
<P> But just when you start to think perhaps Claus was unjustly
accused, pesky details creep into the picture. If Claus wasn't plotting
Sunny's death, why did he show his mistress a legal analysis of Sunny's
will? Why did he lie to the doctor who investigated Sunny's first coma?
And what possible reason could there have been for him to spend five
whole days in a cramped apartment with his mother's corpse before
reporting the death to the authorities. In the eyes of Schroeder and
company, Claus may or may not have tried to kill Sunny but it's certain
he did very little to stop her from destroying herself.</P>
<P> In any case, it's the sorrowful Sunny whose presence hangs over
everything. "I never came out of this coma," Sunny remarks in her
ethereal narration, adding with a hint of mischief, "and I never will."
We may never learn the truth about what really went on inside the von
Bulow's Newport estate during that black Christmas, but "Reversal of
Fortune" serves up plenty of fascinating theories. James Sanford</P>
