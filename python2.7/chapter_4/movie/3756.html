<PRE>                                   AMATEUR
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Hal Hartley's latest film, AMATEUR, is quite a departure from his
earlier work.  Gone is his traditional lead, the crimson-haired ingenue
Adrienne Shelly, and in her stead are two foreign actresses, Isabelle
Huppert (as a lapsed nun trying to make it as a porn story writer and who
believes she is a nymphomaniac) and Elena Lowensohn (as Sofia, a somewhat
psycho porn star).  Hartley's favorite male lead, Martin Donovan, remains
as Thomas, the slimeball husband of Sofia.</P>
<P>     The plot is this:  Sofia is fed up with Thomas, so she tries to kill
him.  He doesn't die--he just cracks his head and develops amnesia. 
Isabelle finds him and takes him under her already fragile wing.  Throw in
an extortion plot wherein the old Thomas was trying to blackmail a
nameless entity, and add the thugs trying to kill him.  Eventually,
everyone gets sucked into this scheme, and nothing works out for any of
them.</P>
<P>     Why AMATEUR?  Well, all the principals are new at something: 
Isabelle is new at the porn game and a virgin to boot.  Sofia is new at
trying to extort money from someone.  Thomas is new to life in general. 
Clever, right?</P>
<P>     Well....  The problem is that the plot is revealed so cryptically and
moves so slowly that it renders the movie stagnant.  It's difficult to
follow, and the characters drone on and on at each other, philosophizing
at length, about what, I can't even remember.  The action/comedy sequences
are superb, but there just aren't enough of them to carry the film.  The
end result is that AMATEUR is a fabulous story that's told rather badly.</P>
<P>     At least the acting is on target, and the story is original.  And
some of the film's scenes, especially the ones involving the two thugs,
Thomas's old partner, and his torture and revenge, are so bright as to dim
the rest of the movie.</P>
<P>     Hartley's characteristic oddball-ness is here, all right, but the
fresh and funny approach to the way we live our lives is absent.  AMATEUR
could have been an action-driven comedy instead of a sloppy narrative;
Hartley made a "deep" and tragic movie about big-time people.  Whereas a
movie like TRUST, a film about lower-middle class twenty-somethings, was a
comedic riot.  Hal, I hope you return to your old ways.</P>
<PRE>     And I miss Adrienne, too.</PRE>
