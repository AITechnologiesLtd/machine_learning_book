<PRE>TITANIC
Review By David Wilcock (C)1998</PRE>
<P>Running Time: 195 minutes (3 hours 15 minutes!)
Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet and Billy Zane
Written & Directed By James Cameron</P>
<P>Titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it's upsetting that it
isn't. The film, which cost $200 million+ to make and could of put
20th Century Fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it 'sunk' (pun
intended) is a labour of love for Cameron, who wrote and directed
the film. We all know that big budget dosen't mean great film (see
Waterworld (1995)) but Titanic is far superior to Kevin
Costners waterlogged epic. But sadly, Titanic just misses the
mark of masterpiece (although it is one of Cameron's best films)</P>
<P>The film starts with present day explorers searching the runied
Titanic. They find a safe, and inside a picture of a woman. The
woman in the picture (an old Winslet) tells the explorers that the
picture is of her. The explorers invite her over, and she then tells
her story of Titanic. In the flashback, DiCaprio plays poor boy
Jack Dawson, who, after winning a poker game, wins two tickets
to board the grand ship Titanic, leaving Liverpool to go to
America. Also boarding the ship is rich woman Rose DeWitt
Bukater (Winslet) who is being forced into a marriage with a man
she dosen't love at all, Cal Hockley (Zane) so her family can
remain rich. She nearly commits suicide on the ship, but Jack
comes to the rescue, saves Rose, they fall in love, and Cal gets
jealous and eventually tries to kill them. Oh yeah, and the ship
sinks.</P>
<P>And that is the main problem with the film, and which stops it from
being a work of genius. The story and script (both by Cameron)
are both weak. The story is full of cliched characters, (the creepy
man who the nice girl has to marry, the poor boy with heart, the
stuck-up mother) and poor dialogue (the script consists of lots of
in-jokes of how the boat won't sink, and most of the dialogue is
pretty basic) It's a shame really, as the audience does have to sit
through 3 hours of this film. Without good dialogue, a film could
become a very long, very boring film (like Camerons own
Terminator 2, 1992) But, luckily, there are some redeeming
features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear.</P>
<P>Firstly, there's Cameron's direction. There are some great
sweeping shots of the Titanic, and some clever fades between the
flashback Titanic and the ruined Titanic. But the scenes Cameron
directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end. There is a
lot of mayhem and panic, all done very well by Cameron. It's a
scary sight, watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery
depths below. Thanks to Cameron's direction, then, the audiences
attention is held for the full 3 hours 15 minutes.</P>
<P>To support the directing are the excellent cast, working very well
with their underwritten characters. DiCaprio is good, although he
only looks 16-17 years old. His performance of a over excitiable,
yet also well mannered boy is excellent, and he also has some
funny lines. Winslet is great also, and her transistion from a well
mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth. Zane
is deliciously evil as Cal, saying every line with a sneer and a flicker
of the eye lash. The audience really does come to hate him. He
may be playing the same character he plays in every film he's in
(like Dead Calm, 1988) but he does it really, really well. Also
worthy of note is Kathy Bates (Edward Scissorhands, 1990) as
a loud mouthed American. </P>
<P>Finally, the icing on the 'great things' cake are the special effects.
Cameron is a whiz with effects (just watch Aliens (1988),
Terminator 2 and True Lies, 1994) and they are used very well
throughout. The sweeps of the ships are awesome, although Digital
Domain, who did the effects, cannot animate human movement too
well. The humans seem to move to 'smoothly', there's just
something odd about them. You can tell that they have been
animated on a computer. Of course, the ship sinking scenes are
awesome, with bodies flying all over the place, and the scene
where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed. Titanic
is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the film. </P>
<P>Titanic, then, is a wonder of directing, acting and CGI, but not
writing and story. Again, like most of Camerons films, the editing is
loose (Cameron edits himself), and the film could of come in under
three hours with a few more cuts. Titanic, then, although not the
Godfather of movies it could of been, is a wonderful attempt at
creating a work of genius. Enjoyable, scary, and even sad, Titanic
is a film cinema was invented for, filling the screen with incredible
images, and assaulting the ears with awesome sound. A superb
film, but sadly not perfect.</P>
<P>OVERALL RATING= ****1/2 out of ***** (4 1/2 out of 5)</P>
