                         There's Something About Mary
                    A movie review by "Average Joe" Barlow
                             (c) Copyright 1998</PRE>
<P>STARRING:   Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon, Ben Stiller, Lee Evans,
            W. Earl Brown
DIRECTORS:  Bobby and Peter Farrelly
WRITERS:    Ed Decter, John J. Strauss, and the Farrelly Brothers
RATED/YEAR: R/1998</P>
<P>        Everybody loves Mary (Cameron Diaz), and it's easy to understand
why: not only is she beautiful, intelligent, funny, and financially secure,
she has the proverbial heart of gold as well.  She places other people's
needs well above her own, to the extent of spending all her free time doing
volunteer work with the mentally retarded, a group that includes her
beloved brother Warren (W. Earl Brown).  Men can't resist Mary, and that's
her biggest problem: she's constantly (and unintentionally) attracting
losers when she wants a soulmate.
        Ted Stroehmann (Ben Stiller), Mary's high-school sweetheart, has
never been able to forget her.  After learning that she moved to Miami
after graduation, he hires a private investigator named Pat Healy (Matt
Dillon) to track her down.  If it turns out that she's still single, perhaps
he'll be able to win her back.  Unfortunately, Healy also falls in love with
Mary after he locates and meets her.  The two men suddenly find themselves,
along with numerous other guys, in a fierce battle to win her heart... and
they will stop at nothing, and I mean *nothing*, to end up with Mary in
their arms.
        That's the intriguing premise of "There's Something About Mary,"
the surprisingly funny new film from the Farrelly Brothers, the duo who
brought you "Dumb and Dumber" and "Kingpin."  They've come a long way since
then.  "Mary" is far more mature (on the whole) than either of its
predecessors, which too often relied on potty humor involving wee-wees,
bathroom noises, and uncovered bottoms.  Instead, "Mary" gives us
characters that are actually interesting, rather than merely serving as
transitions from one sight gag to the next.
        That's not to say that "Mary" is lacking in the humor department,
however.  There are lots of laughs to be found, and the scenes featuring
the cute little dog belonging to Mary's next-door neighbor Magda (Lin
Shaye) are almost painfully funny.  Unlike "Dumb and Dumber," "There's
Something About Mary" wisely allows the jokes to serve a story that's
clever and interesting in its own right.  The result is a film that leaves
you laughing even as you wonder what's going to happen next.
        Matt Dillon's performance as Pat Healy, the private investigator,
is tremendously entertaining.  After eavesdropping on a conversation between
Mary and her girlfriends, he discovers that she wants to meet a guy who
loves to travel to "exotic places like Nepal."  Her mystery man must also
be creative (like an architect, for instance), and he must love sports.
This gives Dillon's character the opportunity to introduce himself as a
freelance architect and football nut, who owns a condo in Katmandu.  In
another attempt to impress her, he proudly states that he "loves working
with retards."  Mary is of course aghast at his crassness, but he doesn't
catch on.  He then explains how he keeps his "little retard friend Mongo"
locked up in a cage, but allows him to run around the yard on one of those
"clothesline-leash things."  The scene is brilliantly played by both Diaz
and Dillon: just witness the way Mary is torn between repulsion and
adoration for Healy, and the way he simply doesn't get why his crass
remarks offend her.
        Stiller, as the high-school sweetheart, is fun as the straight
man.  He never tries to be anything he's not: all he wants is another chance
with the girl of his dreams.  Perhaps this is why he's so appealing to us.
Other less important characters drift in and out of the film, including
Mary's British friend Tucker (Lee Evans), who plays a bigger role in her
life than we might originally expect.
        "There's Something About Mary" contains moments of true comic
genius, but alas, it sometimes shows chinks in its armor.  The directors
seem unsure whether its target audience, the "Dumb and Dumber" fans, will
be able to handle a story of this caliber, so they revert to the "potty
humor" standby a little too often.  The opening scene, for example, in
which a high-school-age Ben Stiller gets ready to take Mary to the prom,
features a much-too-long segment in which our hero gets his male anatomy
caught in his zipper.  (Sarcasm: Boy, *that's* funny.)  Another scene,
which coincedentally involves an *adult* Ben Stiller bathroom penis
adventure, is even more tasteless.  The packed audience howled with
laughter at both of these scenes; I scowled and rolled my eyes.  (Sarcasm:
Wow, that's even *funnier*.)  And I guess I'm the only person in the world
who does not find anything amusing about a man getting his crotch bitten
by a dog.  (That's three Ben Stiller penis jokes in the same movie, folks.
I think the directors have some latent issues they need to work through.)
        The mostly clever screenplay only falters once more: early in the
film, we learn that Mary's brother Warren tends to go ballistic when
someone he doesn't trust touches his ears.  After seeing this happen twice,
I predicted that by the end of the film, Warren would allow one of Mary's
suitors to touch his ears, and Mary would use this as a factor in deciding
which one she wanted to date.  I was not wrong.  (And please don't accuse
me of giving away a plot point; if you CAN'T see this coming, you should
have your film-watching license revoked.)
        Overall, though, "There's Something About Mary" is a treat.
Cleverly written, with characters who are an absolute joy to watch, this
is one that should be seen by anyone who's ever pined over "the one who
got away."  With this role, Cameron Diaz finds herself one step closer to
super-stardom.
        Oh, be sure to stay for the end credits, which feature a Jackie
Chan-style montage of outtakes and cut scenes.  Seeing the cast and crew
lip-synching along to the '60s pop classic "Build Me Up, Buttercup" is 
almost worth the price of admission by itself.</P>
