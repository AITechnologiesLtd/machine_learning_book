<P>END OF DAYS (M).  
(Beacon/Village Roadshow)
Director: Peter Hyams
Stars: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gabriel Byrne, Robin Tunney, Kevin Pollack, 
Rod Steiger, CCH Pounder, Derrick O'Connor, Miriam Margolyes,
Mark Margolis, Udo Kier
Running time: 120 minutes.</P>
<P>After a two year hiatus from the screen, a period that
included heart surgery, Arnold Schwarzenegger is back to prove that he
is still the main man when it comes to big budget action films.
Guiding him through his paces in his return to the screen is Peter
Hyams (Capricorn One, etc), who gave fallen action star Jean-Claude
Van Damme two of his best films in Time Cop and the Die Hard clone
Sudden Death.  Thankfully, End Of Days is Schwarzenegger's best action
flick since True Lies.</P>
<P>Best described as The Omen meets The Terminator, End Of Days
is the first major mainstream film to tap into the paranoia and fear
surrounding the end of the millennium and the uncertainty surrounding
what the brave new world will bring.  Written by Andrew Marlowe (Air
Force One, etc) the film deftly mixes Biblical prophecies about doom
and the end of the world with pyrotechnics and spectacular action
sequences.</P>
<P>Here Arnie tackles no less a villain than Satan himself.  In
the form of Gabriel Byrne, the devil has come to New York to wreak
havoc according to an ancient prophecy from the Book Of Revelations.
He has to consummate his relationship with the virginal Christine
(Robin Tunney, from The Craft, etc) in the hour before midnight to
consolidate his power in this world.  Christine has been specially
protected by guardians since her birth to ensure she is kept pure for
Satan's inevitable arrival.</P>
<P>Arnie plays Jericho Cane (a suitably Biblical name for a
flawed hero), a former cop now working as a body guard for a high tech
protection firm.  He becomes involved in trying to protect Christine,
not only from the devil himself, but from a hit squad of Vatican
sanctioned assassin priests, who want her removed for obvious reasons.</P>
<P>Arnie is back to doing what he does best, carrying high power
weaponry, destroying half a city and killing half the population of a
major city to perform his duty.  However, his seemingly invulnerable
character here has a little more depth than we normally expect from
the one dimensional Schwarzenegger, although his act of sacrificing
himself to save mankind reeks of the end of Terminator 2.</P>
<P>Kevin Pollack does his familiar schtick as the wise cracking
off sider, and brings some humour to proceedings.  Byrne (who hits for
the good guys in the forthcoming spooky religious thriller Stigmata)
does a wonderfully malevolent job as the devil in human form.  Rod
Steiger (who was originally slated for the Byrne role) contributes a
smaller role as a priest who urges our hero to have faith.</P>
<P>End Of Days may lack a little in the logic department, but it
certainly makes up for these failings with some spectacularly staged
action sequences and great special effects.  Hyams, who also doubles
as cinematographer, handles the action with his usual efficiency, and
he doesn't let either his star or his audience down.</P>
