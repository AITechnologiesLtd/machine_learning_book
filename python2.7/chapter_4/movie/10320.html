<P>     One of the more monotonous entries in the 35 year-old (!) series,
TOMORROW NEVER DIES is long on action but short on style.  (And suave.
And sex appeal.  And...)  Brosnan, Pierce Brosnan is back, looking good
and acting a world more relaxed than his first Bond at-bat, GOLDENEYE.
Though still far from the cool cucumber that Sean Connery was, Brosnan
appears well on his way to eventually outperforming Timothy Dalton, Rog-
er Moore, and ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE one-timer George Lazenby.
Too bad, then, that 1997 finds the role retooled, from secret agent to
super (action) hero.  (Gotta feed the international audience...)  Babes,
bon mots, and battling wits?  Fuggedaboudit.  This year's Bond spends
most of the movie in motion, fighting the bad guys on land, on sea, and
in the air.  (The plot involves a media mogul, played by Jonathan Pryce,
who wants to start a world war to improve ratings.)</P>
<P>     The opening, involving a stolen fighter jet at a "terrorist arms
bazaar," is engaging enough, but quickly displays that director Roger
Spottiswoode (AIR AMERICA, TURNER AND HOOCH) isn't exactly a master of
mayhem.  His sole inspired sequence is a parking-lot car chase, with
Bond driving from the *back* seat of his customized BMW.  (You know, the
one from the TV commercials.) Other problems range from the obvious (no
one behaves as if WWIII is imminent) to the insidious (the high-tech
sets look too much alike).  (Composer David Arnold's persistent quoting
of Monty Norman's original theme is annoying, as well.  And, jeez, did
the miniatures have to look so obviously like miniatures?  At least Judi
Dench is back, as "M.") For a holiday blur of explosions, automatic-
rifle fire, breaking glass, and twisted metal, this is the movie for
you.  Just don't expect to leave feeling either shaken or stirred.</P>
