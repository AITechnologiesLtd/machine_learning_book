<P>   You might be tempted to walk out during the first twenty
minutes of "Black Cat, White Cat."  The opening scene,
perhaps meant to develop one of the principal characters,
comes off as largely irrelevant and all too casually paced. 
But remain in your seats.  You're in for a treat.  "Black Cat,
White Cat" is one of the most energetic pictures you'll ever
see, featuring unrelenting physical comedy: pratfalls, vulgar
jokes and repugnant situations, as well as oodles of ethnic
folklore.  Emir Kusturica, arguably the most important director
of films in the Serbo-Croatian language, demonstrates his
resolute love of gypsies in his native land with a frenetic
burlesque that his previous work, "Underground," barely
suggests.  The Bosnian-born filmmaker--who in 1995, after
some disastrous reviews of "Underground" swore off films--
has come back with a vengeance in this pulsating French-
German-Yugoslav production now scheduled to open
commercially in the fall of 1999.</P>
<P>   Following up on his Cannes-winning "Time of the Gypsies"
which Kusturica made ten years back, "Black Cat, White Cat"
follows the lives of two feuding gypsy families living on the
banks of the Danube River.  The families are led by two 80-
year-olds who have not seen each other in twenty-five years,
though they remain good friends.  Grga Pitic (Sabri
Sulejmani) and Zarije Destinov (Zabit Mehmedovski) are big
industrialists, one owning a cement plant, the other heading a
garbage dump, each with a son involved in a predicament. 
Zarije's boy Matko (Bajram Severdzan), is a racketeer
planning to rob a train of its fuel.  To fund the operation he
contacts Grga.  The operation does not pan out: Matko is
double-crossed by Dadan (Srdjan Todorovic) to whom he
now owes a debt.  Dadan, a manic, coke-snorting gangster,
demands that Matko marry off his son Zare (Florijan Adjini) to
Dadan's dwarfish daughter, Afrodita (Salija Ibraimova).  When
Afrodita demurs, insisting that she will wait for a man she can
love, she is unceremoniously dumped into a well until she
reluctantly agrees to the match.  For his part Zare has fallen
for the attractive barmaid, Ida (Branka Katic), whom he
follows around like a puppy, but upon Ida's shoulders falls the
need to instruct the callow young man in the mysteries of
love.</P>
<P>   "Black Cat, White Cat" features a hilarious, extended
wedding scene, full of throbbing gypsy music, a scene in
which the hugely entertaining Srdan Todorovic walks away
with the movie.  A perpetual motion machine, Dadan is all
motility, sniffing coke, waving his arms about like a 20-year-
old American kid in an acid-rock disco.  He alternately
threatens his opponents and celebrates his daughter's
nuptials with all the frenzy of a cheetah on speed, ultimately
gaining his comeuppance as he falls through the floor of the
local outhouse.</P>
<P>   The film combines Marx-Brothers antics with Fellini-esque
scenes (including a repeated vista of a pig eating a
dilapidated car and gaggles of geese, a dog, and two cats).
Kusturica's camera people, Thierry Arbogast and Michel
Amathieu do a matchless job of capturing fetching expression
on the faces of the mostly unprofessional actors as they
plunge headlong into life.  One darkly comic situation centers
on the two octogenarians who, believed to be dead, are
hidden in the attic under mounds of ice so that the wedding
can proceed without the customary 40 days of mourning. 
The subtext that runs through the picture is Kusturica's
implied belief that ethnics around the world are not only
similar in temperament but they are also the folks who really
know how to live.</P>
