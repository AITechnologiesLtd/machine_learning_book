Dr. T and the Women</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>Did you like Diane Keaton's "Hanging Up?" If so, you'll probably equally 
enjoy this rich (as in wealthy) women farce. Dressed in furs, wild hats 
and jewelry, these well-to-do women bumble around Dr. T (Richard Gere) 
like bees with cell phones. </P>
<P>Though adored by his entourage of gynecological patients, daughters, 
sisters and even his screwy wife, Dr. T tries to keep his life from 
bursting apart at the seams. It's one thing after another until the roof 
blows off. </P>
<P>The film opens between the legs of one of Dr. T's gynecological 
patients. Circus appropriate, Dixieland music comprises the soundtrack. 
But somehow, everyone thinks the gentle and sincere Dr. T has it all 
together. Even Dr. T's hunting pals envy his seemingly perfect life and 
perfect wife. "You're a lucky man, hang on to her," they advise him of 
his mentally ill spouse. "I'm trying," he replies with a heartfelt 
anxiety not picked up by the camouflaged buds. </P>
<P>With wife (Farrah) institutionalized, daughters feuding over a wedding, 
woman lined up outside the office door for a check up; Dr. T finds a new 
refuge and a new set of problems. </P>
<P>Gere is compelling and charming as always, the women perform admirably. 
Though the dialogue is strongly real, it's seldom sparkling. Sporting 
some fairly well paced direction, it's the story that seems to have a 
point missing. </P>
<P>Coupled with the oft times annoying cell chat, the film hardly leaves 
the goer with any sense of satisfaction. Though the climax is 
interesting ... it isn't fulfilling, and you'll leave the theater 
feeling like you've just witnessed the work of a great conversationalist 
who didn't have much to say. </P>
