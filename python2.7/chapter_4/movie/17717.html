<PRE>THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>In THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS (LA VIE RÊVÉE DES ANGES), Isa (Élodie
Bouchez) and Marie (Natacha Régnier) are two twenty-year-old women who
lead an itinerate lifestyle.  Rarely with much money, they go from one
odd job to another.  They meet at a sewing job, something for which
neither of them is particularly well suited.   Isa, who carries all of
her possessions on her back, talks Marie in letting her stay in the
apartment in which Marie lives temporarily until its owners come back.
Since both of the owners are in a coma after a car accident, it isn't
clear when, if ever, they will return.</P>
<P>The bleak and surprisingly thin story has the two women form a modest
bond due to their similar circumstances.  Besides being without funds,
both grew up in unhappy homes -- Isa because her parents broke up and
Marie because her parents didn't.</P>
<P>In a story in which almost nothing happens until the last scene, we do
learn much about Isa's smoking techniques.  First-time director Erick
Zonca, who shares the writing credits with Roger Bohbot, apparently
believes that people reveal much about their character by the exact
manner in which they smoke.  Although both women share a nicotine habit,
Zonca uses repetitious tight shots to dwell on Isa's proclivity.</P>
<P>Isa, with her fingernails always partially covered with old nail polish,
likes to grip her cigarettes as if she is trying to crush them.  She
prefers long drags that suck in her checks, and she follows them with
vigorous exhales of dense smoke.  After every third puff, she
ritualistically picks off a tobacco particle from either her lip or
tongue.  I have yet to decode the precise significance of these
mannerisms, but given the screen time devoted to them, they must contain
important symbolism.</P>
<P>The title is essentially a misnomer.  The story has little to do with
angels or dreams, although a subplot does have Isa sitting in the
hospital with the apartment owner's comatose daughter and reading from
her diary.  Most of the movie is devoted to Isa and Marie's relationship
and to Marie's sex life.  A troubled and angry woman, Marie acts like
she is going to slug the men she meets but ends up going to bed with
them instead.  Sex with Marie can be rather like a wrestling match.</P>
<P>Character-driven movies like this succeed based on how compelling the
characters are, and neither of the leads here ever manage to draw us
into the story.  The director makes especially uninspired choices in the
staging.  Besides his obsession with the intricacies of smoking, he also
features a segment on the washing and drying of a backpack.  The result
is that, at the end, when the film finally tries to engage the audience,
we've long since lost interest.</P>
<P>"You've been moping around all week," Marie complains to Isa during one
of their mild spats.  This is the exactly the problem with the movie.
It mopes around most of the time with not much to say.  Oh well, at
least the two actresses do show promise even with such bland material.</P>
<P>THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS runs 1:53.  The film is in French with English
subtitles.  It is not rated but would probably be an R for sex, nudity
and profanity.  The movie would be fine for older teenagers.</P>
