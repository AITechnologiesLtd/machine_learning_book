<P>     James L. Brooks has a rare gift as a film-maker:  the ability to give
the people what they want while also giving them what _he_ wants.  TERMS
OF ENDEARMENT was a crowd-pleasing tear-jerker buoyed by smart comedy and
rich characterizations; BROADCAST NEWS brought a throwback romantic comedy
sensibility to an upscale study of journalistic ethics with an
unexpectedly down-beat conclusion.  Even the notorious Little Musical That
Wasn't I'LL DO ANYTHING demonstrated Brooks' willingness to cut bait when
he knew the audience had no interest in what he was offering.  His
instincts have proven as irreproachable as they are unconventional.</P>
<P>     AS GOOD AS IT GETS had the potential for a classic written all over
it.  For once, however, Brooks doesn't have a grip on how best to handle
his material.  He casts Jack Nicholson as a bile-spewing satyr, then turns
him into a repentant bile-spewing satyr.  He crafts an appealing
relationship between two troubled and mis-matched characters, then muddles
the mix by throwing in a third troubled character.  He takes 90 minutes of
great material and drags it out over nearly two and a half hours.</P>
<P>     It didn't have to be like that.  AS GOOD AS IT GETS has a wonderful
character at its center, a truly horrible human being named Melvin Udall
(Nicholson).  A reclusive writer diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive
disorder, Melvin has turned his condition into carte blanche to insult and
berate everyone with whom he comes in contact.  That includes Carol
Connelly (Helen Hunt), the waitress who serves him breakfast every
morning, and goes double for his neighbor, gay artist Simon Bishop (Greg
Kinnear).  Then, unexpectedly, Melvin finds himself forced to do something
for someone else, caring for Simon's dog Verdell after Simon is beaten in
a robbery attempt.  That one act seems to launch Melvin on a spate of
selflessness, including helping Carol with her sickly son and driving
Simon to meet with his estranged parents.</P>
<P>     It's an admirable theme for a film, this notion of a man deciding to
change himself when he realizes the effect those changes have on other
people.  But why, of all people, Jack Nicholson?  The pre-conversion
Melvin is an outrageous delight, getting away with hateful rantings few
other characters could without inspiring protests.  His growth as a
character saps him of all his bad-boy energy, leaving in its place a
tricky romance with Hunt which somehow works even with Nicholson
perpetually looking like he's straining at the end of a leash.</P>
<P>     That romance might have been even more effective if Brooks had kept
his attention fixed on how Melvin and Carol are so good and so bad for
each other.  Hunt is superb and heart-breaking as the single mother
struggling to discover how to live her own life again, matching Nicholson
for don't-mess-with-me vigor.  Yet there's always Simon there in the
background, a distracting tangent the lightweight Kinnear can't invest
with sufficient gravity.  His story adds little but the adorably grungy
Verdell, a couple of showboating scenes for Cuba Gooding Jr. as a fuming
art dealer, and a lot of padding to an already over-long film.</P>
<P>     Brooks is too adept with a witty line to turn out a tedious film, and
Nicholson and Hunt too capable to fumble the well-rounded
characterizations.  AS GOOD AS IT GETS simply turns out to be a rare case
of Brooks failing to ride what works for all it's worth.  It's funny but
fitful, because we know this isn't as good as a James L. Brooks film gets.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 plugged Nicholsons:  6.</PRE>
