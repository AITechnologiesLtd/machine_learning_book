                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1993 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>107 min., R, Comedy/Documentary, 1992
Director: Tim Robbins
Cast: Tim Robbins, Gore Vidal, Alan Rickman, Giancarlo Esposito,
      Ray Wise, Susan Sarandon, James Spader, Fred Ward, John Cusack,
      Peter Gallagher, Kelly Willis, Fisher Stevens, Lynne Thigpen</P>
<P>     Tim Robbins plays Bob Roberts, a folk singing senatorial candidate.
He travels around singing songs about the problems with America.  As his
campaign goes on, some people start to turn against him.</P>
<P>     BOB ROBERTS starts off with a good idea, a folk singer who pops
into a government race and then doesn't do much (remind anyone of Ross
Perot).  The problem that hurts this film is that the film isn't that
funny.  Too many of the jokes fail.  Tim Robbins can't sing very well
either, which is not good when his character is a singer.  I don't
recommend that you see this film in the theater.  Instead, if you wish
to see it, wait for the video cassette.  This film is worth viewing for
a very cheap rental.  I give BOB ROBERTS a two on a scale of zero to
five.  BOB ROBERTS is rated R for explicit language and violence.</P>
<P>     The biggest problem that I noticed in this film is that Bob
Robert's music videos were not funny.  I think that they were supposed
to be funny, but they certainly didn't turn out that way.  The videos
weren't well done, and didn't hold my attention.  Some of the songs that
Tim Robbins sang were well done, but in my opinion, Tim Robbins can't
sing.  Those songs that were well written ended up being butchered by
Robbins.  The rest of the songs fell into the same category as the music
videos.</P>
<P>     What I think Tim Robbins tried to create was a pseudo-documentary
showing some of the problems with America today.  The film's basic
problem is that Tim Robbins didn't stick entirely to documentary format
in this film.  Some of the scenes were shot as a movie, and the others
were shot as a documentary; then the two were combined.  I didn't think
that this style worked.</P>
<P>     This film isn't entirely bad.  Most of the cast did a very good
job.  The actor that I think gives the best performance in this film is
Alan Rickman.  He seems to stand a little above the rest of the cast.
The actor that I think does the worst job was Gore Vidal.  He doesn't
seem to be with the film very much.  Some of the scenes (especially the
live television show part) I thought were well done.</P>
