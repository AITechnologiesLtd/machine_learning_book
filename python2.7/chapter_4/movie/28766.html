<PRE>THE TAILOR OF PANAMA
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>What's a spy to do if he can't even land a decent assignment?</P>
<P>THE TAILOR OF PANAMA, based on a John Le Carré novel, is directed in a 
laidback fashion by John Boorman (THE GENERAL). Not exactly a spy story 
or a comedy, although it has aspects of both, the movie is basically a 
character study. Although the acting by the leads, Pierce Brosnan, 
Geoffrey Rush and Jamie Lee Curtis, is consistently dead-on, it isn't 
until the last act that the story finally comes together.</P>
<P>After some dalliance in Madrid, MI6 operative Andy Osnard (Brosnan) is 
relegated to the backwater assignment of a post-Noriega Panama. Deciding 
that there must be some major international incident afoot if he can 
just find the right source, Andy turns to a tailor, Harry Pendel (Rush), 
since he figures that everyone confides in their tailor. Moreover, since 
Andy knows that Harry has a secret criminal past, he uses that to 
blackmail him. Rush, who has a tendency to overachieve with his acting, 
is decidedly reserved this time. Harry, wanting to please and scared to 
do otherwise, manufactures some political intrigue for Andy.</P>
<P>Brosnan, famous for his 007 role, plays Andy as the anti-Bond. Although 
Andy, like Bond, sleeps with as many women as possible and speaks fluent 
double entendre, he is as slimy and oily as Bond is slick and debonair. 
It is a wonderful against type performance by Brosnan and the best 
argument for seeing the movie.</P>
<P>In a smaller but equally important part, Jamie Lee Curtis plays Harry's 
loyal and loving wife. With a quiet intensity, Curtis manages to 
dominate scenes that others should own. And in an age in which actors 
have no problem with massive violence but carefully write no-nudity 
clauses into their contracts, Curtis has a good body and is more than 
happy to flaunt it. She has some simple but erotically charged scenes 
with Brosnan. The best of these has her breast literally falling out of 
her low-cut dress. This incident has more genuine sexuality than a dozen 
canonical scenes of humping actors on squeaking bed frames. </P>
<P>THE TAILOR OF PANAMA is a small movie that ages well. The more you think 
about it; the more you appreciate its subtle charms.</P>
<P>THE TAILOR OF PANAMA runs 1:49. It is rated R for strong sexuality, 
language and some violence and would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
