<PRE>The Land Girls (1998)
Reviewed by Alex Bryson
*** / ****</PRE>
<P>It is 1941 and as the men of Britain's farming communities leave to
fight their roles are assumed by women of the Women's Land Army. The
Land Girls tells the tale of three such ‘girls' brought together from
different backgrounds: Rachel Weisz' Cambridge graduate ‘Ag',
Catherine McCormack's Stella and Anna Friel's (predictably chirpy)
hairdresser, Prue.</P>
<P>Underneath what is ostensibly a story about friendship forged in a
time of adversity, about pulling together and female bonds that
transcend boundaries of class and so on, a more subdued tale of regret
and thwarted happiness lies. Disguised for most of the film by
digestible sentimentality this makes for a bittersweet experience
ultimately.</P>
<P>This is a period drama with a pastoral theme almost out of a Hardy
novel, but the producers know what they are doing and pull it off with
ease. The impossibly picturesque farming community is photographed
beautifully, and this pretty facade will no doubt satisfy those
looking for a BBC costume piece (the costumes are wonderful too
actually).</P>
<P>For such a long film the plot is slight - really just a series of
vignettes chronicling the development of the main characters, but the
acting holds it together. Steven Mackintosh is charged with bedding
the entire female population of the South-West it seems (it is
particularly welcome seeing the Our Mutual Friend pair again), and all
three ‘Land Girls' are a pleasure to watch.</P>
<P>There are many moments of comedy, but in some ways the ethos is grimly
stoic. In keeping with the times duty and sacrifice are paramount, and
additionally we are provided with an examination of guilt and regret
at the choices we make. Don't let that put you off this rewarding look
back at what is fast becoming ancient history though.</P>
