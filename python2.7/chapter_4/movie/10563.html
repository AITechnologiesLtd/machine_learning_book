<PRE>SPELLBOUND (1945)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Alfred Hitchcock
Writers: Ben Hecht and Angus MacPhail (based on the book by Francis
Beeding)
Starring: Ingrid Bergman, Gregory Peck, Michael Chekhov, Leo G. Carroll,
Rhonda Fleming, John Ermery, Norman Lloyd, Bill Goodwin</P>
<P>Psychoanalysis has played a big part in the realm of suspense/thrillers
since the 40s, creating films that would use an analysis to make up for
the typical investigating.  Recent films like "Final Analysis" and "Kiss
the Girls" has relied on a therapist to become the protagonist, and for
his work to play as the detective work in the film.  Well here's the
first one to ever do this: Hitchcock's "Spellbound."  And while not many
thrillers have used this idea as well as this original film, it's still
not the greatest film, especially for a director as amazing as
Hitchcock.</P>
<P>"Spellbound" is nevertheless an intriguing film from start to finish. 
It deals with a female protagonist (not a big thing in thrillers of the
40s): Dr. Constance Petersen (the amaing Ingrid Bergman), who works at
an institute as their only female doctor.  One day, the place is
introduced to a new head of the institute: Dr. Edwards (a very young
Gregrory Peck), who begins to show strange signs of some kind of
psychological intemperment, reacting bizarrely to things as simple as
rubbing a fork against table cloth, or the black stripes on a sweater.</P>
<P>Soon enough, though, Constance and Edwards are hitting it off, and
finding out they love eachother.  But as soon as this happens, it turns
out that Dr. Edwards is not whom he seems.  He is really a man named
John Ballantine, and the real Edwards is dead.  But Constance finds out
quickly that John is not a cold-blooded killer, but really a deep
amnesiac.</P>
<P>Constance risks her entire career to find out about this man since she
loves him, and flees with him into hiding to an old professor of hers,
the eccentric Dr. Brulov (Michael Chekhov - no relation to the Star Trek
guy - sorry, had to be said), where she is sure that she can cure him by
analysis, and discover whether or not he actually did kill Edwards.  The
film unfolds beautifully, holding our interest throughout, but the
ending is somewhat anti-climactic, but works, and even spurns one of the
most tense sequences at the end, even if it is pretty contrived.</P>
<P>There are several flaws with the film, such as: why does Constance risk
her entire life and career for some guy she just knew for a couple days,
even if she does swear she loves him?  There's a great dream sequence
designed by the dream-meister himself, Salvador Dali (Hitch must be a
big fan of "Un Chien Andalou"), and it's great and all, but how does
John, who dreamt it, remember every single detial so clearly?  I know
that when I've had a dream that weird that I can only remember instances
of it.</P>
<P>However, what makes the film rise high above the flaws of the film is
the way that this film is absolutely spellbinding.  The film, as I said,
unfolds wonderfully, and this is so; I was guessing the entire time. 
The film doesn't know a whole lot about psychology, but it at least
knows the basics, and uses these to suspenseful heights, which are
steady throughout the film as you can seldomly see what direction it
will be going in.</P>
<P>The acting from everyone is pretty great, with Bergman showing that
she's a strong woman, although not too strong as she risks her entire
career over an amnesiac man whom she apparently loves (the film could
have backed this up a little bit more).  Peck is great, although his
look of confusion and hypnotism gets so redundant that I started
snickering as the film goes on.  And Michael Chekhov as the wily old man
steals every scene he's in.</P>
<P>There are, of course, the great Hitchcockian moments throughout the
film, some which were pretty innovative for the time.  There is a really
nifty chase scene which is done intelligently as Constance and John are
trying to flee from the police while not making any noticable riffs. 
There's a scene where John is under a trance and it is very forseeable
that he may kill someone (with a brilliant follow-up scene).  The dream
sequence, as I said, is trippy and cool as hell, although too unvague
(and makes too much sense).  And the finale is, as I said, forced, but
with a great POV shot, is done so tensely that yes, I cringed.</P>
<P>Although most of the time, it is, as the title says, spellbinding, it's
still not the greatest film.  Maybe it's the fact that psychology and
suspense are tough bedfellows, but I still can't remember a film that
blended these two ideas together in a neat coherent whole.  It's a minor
disappointment when held up to a lot of Hitchcock's other flicks, but
measured on its own, is a rather satisfying film to watch.  Fun, albeit
not the most intelligent fun it could be, but is still the best suspense
film dealing with psychoanalysis that I can remember.</P>
