<P>Summary
    An elevator ride provides the chance meeting between Corky (Gina Gershon)
and Violet (Jennifer Tilly). There is an instant attraction between them. They
don't speak, probably because Violet is not alone. She is escorted by her
boyfriend Caesar (Joe Pantoliano), a cocky Mafia thug. Corky was recently
released from prison and managed to find work performing building maintenance
on
the apartment complex were Violet and Caesar live.
    It is not long before the two women speak, and their obvious attraction
leads to a passionate love affair. Through their conversations we learn more
about them. Violet is basically a full time escort for Caesar, even though she
doesn't let that stop her from having other clients while Caesar is away. She
has never had a lesbian love affair before. Corky is a lesbian and served time
for theft and is apparently very good with power tools. The women fall in love.
    Caesar informs Violet that another member of the Mafia is suspected of
stealing money from the Mafia boss, Gino Marzzone (Richard C. Sarafian).  The
unfortunate suspect is Shelly (Barry Kivel), a client of Violets who is dealt
with severely by Caesar and relinquishes two million dollars that he had
stolen.
Caesar has to clean the money (which was covered with Shelly's blood), count it
and turn it over to Gino.
    Violet and Corky decide to try to steal the money. They concoct a plan that
would not only allow them to get away with the cash, but set up Caesar so that
it would appear that he took it, forcing him to run for his life. Although the
plan seemed like a great idea, the execution of it becomes the women's worst
nightmare, as every possible wrong turn, bad timing and bad luck arises,
putting
their lives in extreme danger.</P>
<P>Commentary
    I can't recall a film where the last hour was so absolutely riveting. A
great edge-of-your seat thriller the keeps the adrenaline flowing. But this
isn't just a thriller, it has elements of black comedy, a love story, and noir.
That is not to say that the setup isn't well done - it is, but it's the
incredible final two-thirds of the film that stick in your mind.
Very compelling characters, especially Caesar, who by usual movie standards
should be the dimwitted Mafia hood bad guy, and Violet, who appears to be the
stereotypical bimbo. Both characters show a surprising intelligence and depth,
and are well played by Pantoliano and Tilly. There is such good acting in this
film that I could mention every performance, but the only other character I
will
single out is Micky (played wonderfully  by John P. Ryan), as a Mafia enforcer
who steals most of his scenes, including a great scene at the end, where he
conveys his feelings to Violet by facial expression alone, without making a
sound. It was incredible acting.
I also wanted to take a quick moment to plug the DVD format. The DVD for Bound
is top notch. Not only does the picture and sound do the format justice, but it
includes the best director commentary I have heard, as the Wachowski brothers
are joined by all three of the leading stars for the narrative. There is a
great
comment where Jennifer Tilly explains how, during a screening of the film the
violent outcome with Shelly is edited out (if you saw it, you know what I am
talking about). Because of this edit, a later scene involving Caesar
threatening
Violet in the same manner didn't have nearly the same dramatic effect. If
anything, it proves the importance of good film editing.
There are many different elements to this film that contribute to its great
style. It seems most of the scenes were shot in one extreme (dark rooms with
many shadows) to another (very bright blinding bathrooms). There are also trick
shots like Gino's slow fall to the floor, Caesar's panic-stricken stumble after
opening his briefcase (he had a camera strapped to his belly), and a slow pan
out to reveal the direct view into a gun barrel. All of these elements do the
film justice to create a mood all its' own. It is refreshing to see first time
directors taking these chances and having confidence in the script.
    An absolute must see film. One of the best films of 1996.</P>
