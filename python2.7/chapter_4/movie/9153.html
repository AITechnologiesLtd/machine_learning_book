The Black Swan (1942)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 42</PRE>
<P>"The Black Swan" is a technicolor swashbuckler, combining
romance and adventure, with colorful costumes.  However,
the film often plods, and the epic pirate swordfights
have more energy than conviction.</P>
<P>It is the seventeenth century.  A treaty has been signed 
between England and Spain, awarding Jamaica to British rule.
The pirate ships that have been raiding Spanish vessels
are now targets themselves.  Former pirates Henry Morgan
and Jaime Waring (Tyrone Power) hunt fiery pirate Billy Leech, 
but are betrayed by foppy spy Roger Ingram. Ingram's fiancee 
is Margaret (Maureen O'Hara), but he has a rival in Waring.</P>
<P>O'Hara is beautiful, but her character is a stereotype
of a proud woman accustomed to wealth and privilege.
None of the characters, in fact, is broadly drawn
except for red-bearded pirate Leech, who will never
bow to the authority of any king.</P>
<P>There are too few scenes of true swashbuckling action, and
too much time spent on political intrigue and Margaret's
romance with Waring.  She plays hard to get, while he
justly wonders why he keeps trying (perhaps because she
has second billing).</P>
<P>The costumes are good, but the film was clearly filmed
on a Hollywood set and not on the high seas.  There are
many "outdoor" scenes with superimposed backgrounds.
Sometimes this is an acceptable means of expediting a
film's shooting on budget, but in this case the effect
simply adds to the movie's superficial atmosphere.</P>
