<PRE>Varsity Blues</PRE>
<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P> Why do people do such stupid things?  Why do we marry people we hate,
divorce people we like, and, above all, why the hell would MTV want to try
to be dramatic?</P>
<P> Yes, you heard my right, Music Television Productions has decided all of a
sudden that there is something serious about gangster rap and N'Sync and
Backstreet Boys and all of these other bubble-gum teeny-bob-wanna-screw-'em
bands.  It's bad enough that the degraded the once moderately intelligent
real world into a cheap soap opera, but, come on, do they have to make
football dramatic?</P>
<P> Well, I guess someone thought they did, because someone set down to
creating the cheapest possible storyline about a team trying to win their
23rd Division Championships.  And of course the team is helmed by the coach
from hell, played by Jon Voight, displaying all of the collective charm of
Adolph Hitler (we he quiets the audience in the beginning, I swore to God
that he would say "Se Keil").</P>
<P> Of course they decided to helm the actual cast of the movie with James Van
Der Beek, teen idol and girls' drool tool from "Dawson's Creek".  And he
plays the same moderately innocent idealistic youth.  In Varsity Blues,
being a writer is all he wants and he spends his time reading Kurt Vonnegut.
In "Dawson's Creek", all he wants is to be a director and he spends his time
watching Spielburg.</P>
<P> As far as storyline goes, there really isn't one.  There really isn't a
plot or a point, either.  But I forgot to tell you: If you're more of a
football fan than a moviegoer, by all means, enjoy the mainstream crap that
Paramount decided to dish you.  I'm not blaming you.  I'm blaming them.</P>
<P> As more of a movie critic than a football fan, I can say that the only
thing about Varsity Blues that I actually enjoyed were the moderately
well-directed football games.  If they filmed football like that on TV, damn
right I'd be sitting there every Sunday Afternoon and Monday Night.</P>
<P> But it isn't and I'm not.  Varsity Blues isn't enjoyable to the
non-football fan.  It doesn't even much deliver on the promise of nothing
but "sex and football".  On the James Brundage
how-much-did-they-unnecessarily-screw meter, it scored a 1 out of 10.</P>
<P> I'm not telling you not to see it due to a lack of redeeming value.  God
knows I love action movies like True Lies and Blade that couldn't care less
about message.  But, for Christ's sake, why do I have to watch a one hour,
forty minute pseudodrama about a sport that should stay on the field and off
the movie set.</P>
<P> I don't know why people do such stupid things.  I can't offer any answers,
only advice.  And the advice I offer you is direct, simple, and to the
point.  Don't do another stupid thing by paying anything to see "Varsity
Blues".</P>
