<PRE>The Full Monty
Review By: Ryan Davis
2/22/98</PRE>
<P>        THE FULL MONTY is a whole lot of fun, its wacky, witty, and original.
It's written and directed by relatively unknowns , Simon Beaufoy and Peter
Cattaneo, who both turned up Oscar nominations. How did this movie with a
budget under 10 Million gross over 175 Million worldwide? Its been rumored
that this film may be the second most profitable movie of the year! And to
think its about male exotic dancers, and not sinking ships.</P>
<P>        Six steel workers who have been recently been laid off and are all
looking for jobs. Inspired by the success of a Chippendale's production, Gaz
(Robert Carlyle) decides they should all put on a strip show to make some
money quickly. As the six team up to put on the show of their lives, they run
into a few problems. For instance, Dave(Mark Addy) is worried about his
weight, Horse (Paul Barber) thinks he may be inadequate, and Gerald(Tom
Wilkinson) is worried about his reputation and timing. So when the night of
the show comes, will the men be able to do the "full monty"?</P>
<P>        As I said before this is a fun movie, and not just that its really
artistically good. The writing and direction are great.  The acting is
appealing, all the performances have a human quality to them, so you can
relate to at least one of the characters. THE FULL MONTY received four Oscar
nominations including Best Picture. Which left me wondering one thing, why
didn't TRAINSPOTTING get a Best Picture nomination last year? While THE FULL
MONTY is a great lighthearted comedy, it doesn't carry the social impact of
the brilliant TRAINSPOTTING. Still, THE FULL MONTY is a great film,  a must
see!</P>
