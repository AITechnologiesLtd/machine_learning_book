<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This film, based on Carl Sagan's novel, is a mixture of sci-fi, romance,
sentimentality, and drama, brought to screen by the director of Forreset
Gump. It relies on its ideas and its mild convictions to sustain its
powerful but soppy story, rather than its special effects, contrary to
many modern films that have just become special effect vehicles. The
Ellie Arroway (Jodie) role as a child of 8, is played by Jena Malone,
who is being raised by her father with tender loving care (her mother
died at childbirth) and with respect for her ability to learn, as he
encourages her interest in astronomy. Unfortunately, he dies of a heart
attack when she is just ten.</P>
<P>At last, we see Ellie, grown-up as an independent, intelligent young
lady, working for the National Science Foundation on a project of
cutting-edge technology. Jodie Foster is feisty, vulnerable, appealing,
self-righteous, and obsessed with seeking scientific truths. She is the
alter-ego for Sagan, challenging the scientific and religious dogmas of
the day, championing a call for poetry and vision in our lives.</P>
<P>Her boss, Palmer Joss (Matthew), feels her research is futile and of no
utilitarian value. He stops her alien contact project and is pictured as
the perfect bureaucrat. Governments seem to trust this type and like to
put them in charge of things.</P>
<P>Ellie falls for a spiritual popularizer of worldly causes ( Tom
Skeritt), who left divinity school because he didn't want to remain
celibate.The attraction between them is overshadowed by idealogical
differences, and nothing can get in the way of Ellie's belief in
evolution, not even this hunk who is a ridiculously loopy caricature of
a religious zealot, one of those religious Johnny-come-lately types.</P>
<P>S.R. Hadden (John Hurt) comes to her rescue as an eccentric, wealthy
scientist, on the lookout for adventurious scientists; his foundation
privately sponsors her research. Ellie succeeds in making contact with
some sort of life in outer space; and, the government, with Michael Kitz
(James Woods) in charge of security, co-opts her project for national
security reasons. Here the story turns melodramatic and goes off on too
many different tangents to adequately keep its focus on its primary
aim-- that there is life in outer space. For these scenes, the film
should have used the dictum from Occam's Razor: The simplest way to do
something is the best way.</P>
<P>As a sci-fi'er, with a good storyline that tends to get too schmaltzy,
this film is up to par with those STAR WARS films, but is outclassed by
2001. Sagan would have been proud of the accuracy and content of this
work had he lived to see the film through to its conclusion, but I don't
think he would have been to happy with the elementary-school theological
debate between the space pioneer and the government officials. The main
argument in the film, is when Jodi is asked by that government panel
whether she believes in the God of the Bible. It is an embarrassing
scene, as she waivers, not trying to answer the question directly,
because if she said she didn't believe in God, they wouldn't let her go
up in space. I think the best answer a scientist could give in this
scenario, was not given by Jodi...but, then again, she got to go up in
space. A Steven Hawkings might have said that it is through these
scientific machines that we will come closest to reading the mind of
God. Albert Einstein might have said that the God of order created this
beautiful world we live in, and that the other kind of God, the one of
prayer and the one of interpretation by man and interjection, is a
speculative one. That the world had to be created out of the first
concept of God; the world is not a result of an accident. It is a thing
of great beauty. At least, this is what my science friends tell me is
the more typical attitude toward God in their community.</P>
