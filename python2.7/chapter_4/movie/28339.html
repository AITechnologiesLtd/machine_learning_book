<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>'The Interview' is a frightening mystery tale about the way the police
conduct a criminal investigation as they try to find the truth. It
builds in intensity for the desperate man being questioned and the
desperate detectives asking the questions. They keep the viewer riveted
to the twists in plot as one's perceptions about the case are subject to
change, in this excellently conceived Australian psychological thriller.
What is the truth can only be surmised by the film's end, but enough is
revealed so that you think you know the answer.</P>
<P>Two detectives, Detective Sergeant John Steele (Tony Martin) and
Detective Senior Constable Wayne Prior (Aaron Jeffery), unnecessarily
break down a suspect's door, tear up his place, and use Gestapo tactics
to rouse him as a suspect in a car theft. The suspect is the nondescript
looking Eddie Rodney Fleming (Hugo Weaving), who has been hassled while
he is napping in his plain one-room apartment.</P>
<P>They interview him formally in the stationhouse while not telling him
what he is charged with and fail to read him his rights. Detective Prior
threatens him, intimidates him, and cusses him out; while the senior
detective who has a history of complaints againsts him, constantly
badgers the suspect in a chillingly calculated way and tries to pin a
series of murders on him. It turns out that the owner of the stolen car
is missing, and the detectives believe that their suspect is the reason
for that. They have very little to go on, as they hold him for 5 hours
of questioning without even feeding him. When the unemployed man on
welfare calls for a solicitor, she tells him not to say anything -- they
will have to either charge you or let you go in a reasonable time.
Because of the way the Australian legal system operates, she can't stay
with him while they are interviewing him. If she did, she could become a
potential witness for the prosecution on a subpoena. This leaves the
very edgy and very talkative suspect alone with the two detectives.</P>
<P>The hidden personal agenda by those in the police department, results in
the internal affairs bureau secretly videotaping the interview because
of Steele's previous use of ruthless but effective methods. They fear
because of his illegal methods of investigating, too many of his cases
are thrown out by the courts. When the detectives finally get the
suspect to confess, he can't shut up and gives them a number of serial
killings he said he did. They, at this time, treat him to a sumptuous
feast. But the bad news is the internal affairs investigators rule that
they can't accept the confession because it was given under duress, and
therefore the suspect is set free.</P>
<P>Though the film might not be startling or flamboyant it is competently
acted, especially by the two main antagonists, Hugo Weaving and Tony
Martin. It is chillingly photographed by Simon Duggan, giving it a
retro-noir film look. The first-rate script has us being sympathetic to
the suspect for being unfairly grilled, but that changes because of the
ethics investigators trying to railroad an instinctively good street
detective and making him their sacrificial lamb. Director Craig Monahan
has co-written the film with his police                    technical
adviser, Gordon Davie. He has created a Kafkaesque atmosphere of
paranoia that turns out to be right on the money. The question we are
left with, is whether a psycho serial killer has been set free because
of this bickering in the police department and the misuse of police
powers. A good lesson for the modern Western world to be facing up to,
as criminal investigation methods by the police are constantly under
scrutiny in democratic countries; or, at least, they should be.</P>
