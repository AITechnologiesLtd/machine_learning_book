VERTIGO (1958)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>Sometimes films can be like wine - getting better as they
age. Such examples are, however, very rare and author of
this review can name only few examples of films he
considered better with each subsequent viewing. One of such
films was VERTIGO, 1958 thriller, often mentioned as the
best among many films directed by great Alfred Hitchcock and
one of the greatest films ever made. When I saw this film
for the first time I was not that impressed. Actually, I was
quite disappointed - although VERTIGO looked like a truly
great film, something was missing and I began thinking about
it as one of those overhyped films which filmophiles are
supposed to worship even if they don't particularly like
them. On the second viewing, I began changing my mind about
VERTIGO after discovering some new elements in the films and
looking it from different perspective. My view on VERTIGO
improved and continued to improve after each viewing. Every
time I discovered something new and gradually became
convinced that VERTIGO meets all requirements for cinematic
masterpiece.</P>
<P>VERTIGO was made during the zenith of Hitchcock's career,
with his reputation of great filmmaker already established.
Two French authors, Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac, have
written the novel D'ENTRE LES MORTS especially for
Hitchcock. Hitchcock used the plot of the novel after
adaptations by Samuel A. Taylor and Alec Coppel. Protagonist
of VERTIGO is John "Scottie" Ferguson (played by James
Stewart), San Francisco police detective who discovers that
he suffers from acrophobia while chasing the crime suspect
on rooftops. The chase would end with one of the uniformed
policemen dead and Scottie, traumatised for life, decides to
leave the force. Few months later, he is called by an old
college friend and shipping tycoon Gavin Elster (played by
Tom Helmore) who wants to hire him as a private detective.
Scottie's job is to look after Elster's wife Madeleine
(played by Kim Novak), who is acting strangely, struck with
unhealthy obsession with Carlotta Valdez, woman who took her
own life in San Francisco a century ago. Scottie begins
following Madeleine and gradually falls in love with her.
But his love is weaker than his acrophobia, and he can't
save Madeleine's life when she jumps from the high bell
tower. Stricken with grief, remorse and guilty conscience
Scottie wanders through streets of San Francisco until he
finds Judy Barton (again played by Kim Novak), ordinary girl
who is looking somewhat similar to Madeleine. His interest
in Judy is motivated only by memory of lost love, but young
girl has her own skeletons in the closet.</P>
<P>VERTIGO represents Hitchcock at his best - a great artist
who is willing to experiment while being faithful to his
trademark style in the same time. Result of his efforts is
the film with multiple layers that could satisfy both those
who worship Hitchcock as the king of suspense thrillers and
those who aren't particularly attracted to the genre. Again,
as in many films from this period of Hitchcock's career,
VERTIGO is suspense thriller on surface only. Hitchcock uses
thriller plot only as an opportunity to explore various
forms of human conditions, especially those, which are
considered bizarre, aberrant or downright perverse.
Therefore, VERTIGO should be viewed less as a thriller and
more like a combination of powerful love story and intense
psychological drama. Hitchcock's ability to put all those
contents within the framework of thriller is another reason
why VERTIGO happens to be one of the most celebrated (and
quoted) films in the history of cinema.</P>
<P>VERTIGO is film worshipped by critics and film scholars, but
I doubt that the general audience could share their
enthusiasm. This is probably due to the fact that VERTIGO
happens to be very dark, by many standards the darkest and
most depressing film Hitchcock has ever made. Sinister
dimension of the film could be already found in the
character of protagonist. For many people, James Stewart's
role in this film is one of the most successful
transformations of the actor's image - once good
all-American boy was already playing people with extremely
unpleasant character traits, but John "Scottie" Ferguson
represents the bottom of the barrel. In REAR WINDOW, another
Hitchcock's classic, Stewart played voyeuristic
photographer, but this aberration from societal norms was
something almost acceptable and within the framework of
Hitchcockian formula of "ordinary man in extraordinary
circumstances". But this time Stewart plays character that
is anything but ordinary - Scottie Ferguson is actually
textbook example of various psychopathological conditions.
Pathological fear of heights is the least of his problems,
as well as his inability to deal with women. As the plot
progresses, we see protagonist revealing his darker side.
First we are introduced to his maniacal obsession on the
verge of stalking. Than Hitchcock hints about necrophilia -
Ferguson is attracted to Madeleine less because of her
beauty and more because she is cold and distant, and in one
scene it is implied that he might have had his way with her
while she was unconscious. Finally, in the second part of
film, after being diagnosed as chronic depressive, he shows
his worst side as someone who wants total control over his
sex object. Stewart shows these character traits
uncompromisingly, but the audience is still having some
sympathy for Scottie - this is the reason why the role in
VERTIGO represents the greatest achievement in Stewart's
acting career. Ironically, this role was, according to many
film scholars, inspired by Hitchcock himself - Scottie's
makeover of Judy was in many ways similar to the ordeals
suffered by lead actresses during production of Hitchcock's
films.</P>
<P>The actress who was subjected to such makeover for the
purposes of this film was Kim Novak, one of numerous blonde
sex symbols of 1950s Hollywood whose reputation led many
critics to disregard her genuine acting talent and give all
credit for the success of her role to Hitchcock himself. Kim
Novak played the difficult dual role of Madeleine/Judy with
great success, and it is understandably the best acting
performance of her career, achievement that couldn't be
possible without some true talent. In most likelihood,
critics and film scholars were discouraged from praising her
achievement for the same reason why general audience
wouldn't like this film - her characters are equally dark
and dysfunctional as male protagonist. At first we are
introduced to the woman who is slowly but inevitably
succumbing to self- destructive madness only to see her
reincarnation in seemingly ordinary woman who repeats the
same process. But the most sinister revelation of her
character happens in the end of the film, when Judy not only
voluntarily puts herself through utmost humiliation of
abusive relationship, but also hints that she went through
this before. This depiction of female protagonist as passive
and powerless toy in the hands of morally or sexually
aberrant men is probably the reason why modern-day feminists
shouldn't be too enthusiastic about Novak or Hitchcock.</P>
<P>Some critics tend to claim that VERTIGO can't be masterpiece
because of various plot holes and implausibilties. Those
nit-picks, however, usually point to main characters doing
things or acting in a way normal and ordinary people would
not. But the main characters are already marked as
dysfunctional and nearly psychotic. Because of that they are
more interesting than the supporting, more "normal"
characters, and, consequently, supporting actors are
shadowed by great performances by Stewart and Novak. One of
the exceptions are Barbara Bell Geddes as Marjorie "Midge"
Wood, charming but nerdish friend and ex-fianc‚e of Scottie,
who would provide the only traces of comic relief in this
grim tale. Another is Henry Jones as coroner whose harsh but
nevertheless correct depiction of Scottie's mental state
make him some kind of Greek chorus. While drafting a
villain, Hitchcock again threw away his formula about bad
guys being more interested than protagonists. Gavin Elster
might be manipulative and ruthless bastard, but his
psychology is too normal for Hitchcock; as a result, Tom
Helmore doesn't have to work hard playing him and,
furthermore, Hitchcock simply dumps that character half way
during the him and, in doing so, breaks Hollywood rules
about villains getting away with their crimes.</P>
<P>The acting alone, however, isn't the only reason why VERTIGO
should be considered a masterpiece. Again, like in many
other occasions, Hitchcock showed his great talent of superb
filmmaker, always ready to employ new filming techniques and
create memorable scenes and images. In case of VERTIGO
Hitchcock uses splendid photography by Robert Burke and the
camera rarely leaves the protagonist, which gives a plenty
opportunity for Hitchcock to employ various techniques with
lenses, different lighting (and even some animation during
dream sequences) in order to present the protagonist's
twisted state of mind. San Francisco locations and memorable
music by Bernard Herrmann creates specific, almost surreal
atmosphere of the film - another reason why VERTIGO is
considered one of the everlasting Hitchcockian masterpieces.</P>
