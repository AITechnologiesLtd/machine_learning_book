<P>In the history of movies, some really good movies have come out. They have 
been memorable in our minds, and make us think about them even to this day. 
They can be 100 years old, to only a year old and still be a great film. 
Sometimes they are so good it is hard to explain to someone how good it 
really is. Out of the 1,000s of films I've seen, only one has impacted my 
life so much that to this very day I still think about the movie. It's 
incredible how a film of this standard can sweep the Oscars and audiences 
alike, and be one of the best reviewed films of all time with the critics. 
This movie is that one certain movie, a movie that I saw in theatres close to 
twenty times, but never got tired of the movie, and everytime I viewed it, 
found something new and beautiful.</P>
<P>Kevin Spacey plays an unhappily wed man Lester Burham, married to Annette 
Bening who plays Carolyn, who is unhappy as well, but hides her feelings 
underneath where they bottle up inside of her, ready to pop. Their marriage 
is extremely unhappy and close to falling apart. Thora Birch brilliantly 
plays their daughter Janie Burnhan who has troubles of her own, she thinks 
she isn't pretty and wants new boobs, only to realize that she is beautiful 
in someones eyes. Her neighbor Ricky Fritts (played amazingly by newcomer Wes 
Bentley) who uses his video camera to tape the world as he sees it through 
his eyes, everything has its own beauty in its own way. Mena Suvari impacts 
the screen as Janie's best friend Angela, whom Lester falls for and starts to 
work out, and becomes more rebelous. His life is falling apart, as is the 
world around him, coming to a shocking and deeply emotional, yet oddly 
compelling and satisfying ending.
Kevin Spacey won an oscar for his portrayal of Lester Burnham, a depressed 
deeply complex man who wasn't given enough time to do what he wanted to do, 
but what he did was amazing. Kevin takes the character and turns him into a 
real person, instead of a movie character, he knows what he is doing and 
makes us laugh, think and cry at the same time. Annette Being is one of my 
favorite actresses and she does not let me down here, she takes her character 
and like Spacey turns her into a real person so we feel for her but at the 
same time we hate her in some scenes. She is a character that has her perks 
and her downs. In one of the best teen performances to lighten the screen in 
a long time Thora Birch is absolutely magical as the daughter of this 
disfuctional family. She is so realistic to today's teens and so compelling 
that I feel she is almost a lead character in the movie as is Mena Suvari who 
plays Angela, she does a wonderful job as well. Wes Bentley stands out as the 
next door neighbor boy who sees beautiful things in his own way. Absolutely 
magical acting.</P>
<P>The script is a whole other story combined, this is one brilliant screenplay. 
Alan Ball who wrote this screenplay is to me a brilliant, very smart man who 
has a mind that no one can read or understand. He is very complex and it 
shows in his script, it makes you think while it makes you cry because of how 
beautiful it is, the dialogue comes out of the performers lips so smoothly, 
and they seem to be associating with it, possibly even relating. The audience 
(or at least I was) is in such awe of how amazing this movie is, that we 
almost become a character ourselves. We see through each of the persons eyes, 
and we see how they see, what they see and how what they are seeing affects 
them.</P>
<P>Sam Mendes makes his directing debut, and I must say I was really surprised 
by how good of a job he did on his directing, his camera shots are just plain 
out brilliant. Some of the shots especially towards the end are emotionally 
affecting towards me, and I found myself sitting there with my mouth wide 
open absorbed into this movie. The twists and turns in the story, the 
performances from the actors and actresses, the script that is so good it is 
unbelievable. I tried to find a flaw in this movie, but there was no flaw at 
all. Each and every scene is beautiful and amazing in its own way, never has 
a film made me cry at the end because of how beautiful it is.</P>
<P>To me it's safe to say, although your not supposed to as a movie critic, but 
I can say American Beauty ranks up there as my favorite movie I have seen. 
Besides Halloween, American Beauty is my favorite movie. Some people have all 
time favorites and plenty of them, and believe me I have many favorites, but 
this one I can safely say is my favorite one.</P>
