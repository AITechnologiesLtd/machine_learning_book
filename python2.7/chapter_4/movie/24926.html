<PRE>A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>U-571 is a submarine war movie in almost all senses, but I couldn't help 
thinking of it as a warped science fiction movie. Space movie elements most 
have seen before are abundant here. The crew who sometimes doesn't get along, 
the ship/submarine that's not suited for flying/moving through water and 
needs repairs, the captain shouting off random commands to crew members that 
the audience doesn't understand, etc. During one point near the middle, 
Matthew McConaughey even says, "Make it so" a famous line often uttered by 
Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) in recent Star Trek movies and the Star 
Trek: The Next Generation television series. My mind drifted away with 
thoughts like these for the entire movie, yet it was easy to keep up with the 
events happening onscreen. U-571 takes some simple plot concepts and milks 
them for all they are worth. At times this makes for an entertaining action 
film that’s easy to follow. At other times it's downright cheesy.</P>
<P>An American group of submariners led by Lt. Andrew Tyler (Matthew 
McConaughey) sneak onto a German submarine hoping to capture the Enigma 
cipher machine that would enable the American army to understand coded German 
radio communications. The group kills most of the crew inside and beats the 
ship up pretty bad, but soon their own ship gets blown up. This forces the 
American crew of nine to stay on the enemy submarine and pose as Germans when 
a German re-supply sub comes to help them. The crew, which includes Chief 
Klough (Harvey Keitel) and Tank (Dave Power), must work together to evade 
German ships in hostile waters. </P>
<P>There is a lot to like about this movie. Some action sequences are 
spectacular. One particular scene where water explodes out of the ocean in a 
perfectly timed pattern is nothing short of amazing. The sound is also 
astounding. Remarkable care to the sound effects for this movie make it an 
easy contender for Best Sound and Best Sound Effects Editing at the Oscars. 
The sound really tests the theater’s speaker system. Walking out of the 
movie, I became very surprised. I could still hear! Another nice thing about 
this movie is that the German characters actually speak in German. Instead of 
conversing in English with German accents, there are subtitles as they talk 
on the screen. These people are actually speaking in their native language. 
This is quite a surprise in a mainstream Hollywood action production.</P>
<P>The problem with U-571 is that it lacks appeal. The lead characters 
(McConaughey, Keitel, Paxton, and more) are always grimy, their faces soaked 
with sweat. I don't need to see Harvey Keitel or Bill Paxton with combed over 
hair ever again. It's hard to look at Matthew McConaughey and not see him 
naked playing bongo drums. The crew (which also features the Chris Rock of 
the 1940s) isn't very likable, and there was no chance to pick a favorite or 
choose someone to root for. U-571 is also under the crosshairs regarding its 
accuracy. In reality, the British actually captured the Enigma machine and 
many small details (mostly regarding the operation of a submarine) get 
overlooked. Some WWII veterans have said it's the, "Funniest movie they've 
ever seen." The ending of the movie made me groan with displeasure. It was 
just too unbelievable.</P>
<P>U-571 can't decide whether it wants to be Saving Private Ryan or Titanic, and 
it fails at both. Too many elements were implausible, and some good action 
doesn't make up for the actors and plotline. This submarine sinks without a 
doubt.</P>
