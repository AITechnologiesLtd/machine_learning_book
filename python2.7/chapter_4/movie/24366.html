<PRE>                            ME MYSELF I
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: In one world Pamela Drury chose
          not to marry the man in her life and instead to
          have a serious career.  In a parallel world the
          decision went the other way.  Just when Pamela
          is getting desperate to find a husband she finds
          herself thrust into the other world and having
          to be the other version of herself.  This gives
          her an opportunity to explore the good and bad
          aspects of her decision.  Rachel Griffiths stars
          in this emotional Australian fantasy.  There are
          logic flaws but the film remains entertaining.
          Rating: 6 (0 to 10), high +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Pamela Drury (played by Rachel Griffiths) is an award-winning
journalist.  Thirteen years earlier she nearly married Robert
Dickson (David Roberts), but decided that her career was more
important.  She now looks with envious eyes on her married friends'
lives and she wishes she had made the other decision.  These days
she just finds the dating scene to be depressing and the market just
is not very good any more.  She tries to salve her ego putting up
little index cards that tell her things like "I love and approve of
myself."  On her 30-something birthday she is ready to commit
suicide, but fate seems to step in and stop her at the last moment.
The following day in a moment of carelessness she is hit by a car a
literally knocked into another world.  She is not in heaven or hell,
but a parallel world where she did marry Robert.  There Pamela
meets-well, call her Pamela-2 (also played by Rachel Griffiths).
Pamela-2 has been married for thirteen years to Robert and has a
daughter and two sons by him.  Pamela-2 regrets her decision to
marry and to turn her back on her career.  She gives Pamela the slip
and goes to take her place in the world of the career-Pamela.
Pamela decides to try out the life she spurned.</P>
<P>     Filling in for Pamela-2 is more of a job than Pamela was
expecting, but far easier than it would be in the real world.  There
one must remember what must be hundreds of thousands of bits of
information just so that people are not tipped off that you are no
longer the person you once were.  Pamela finds that as feminists
have been telling us for years, there is a lot of effort and skill
involved in being a housewife.  It would be easy for this film to
turn at this point into a feminist tract, leaving Pamela in awe of
how competent and savvy a housewife really is.  However the script
is a little more even-handed than that.  Being a housewife has its
positive and its negative sides, Pamela finds.  It is full of
moments that just fill Pamela with disgust.  The worst of which is
to clean up after her youngest who is neither toilet trained, nor
able to wipe himself.  Having been in need of sex well back into her
previous life, she is disappointed to realize that the passion is
gone from Pamela-2's marriage and Robert has very little interest in
rekindling it.  But her attitudes about her husband and herself are
due for some radical changes.</P>
<P>     ME MYSELF I is written and directed by Philippa "Pip" Karmel,
set in Sydney, Australia and filmed on a minimal budget which seems
to more than adequately support the script. Rachel Griffiths has an
extremely expressive face which projects emotions very effectively,
particularly her bewilderment at her situation.  Karmel's style
changes as the film proceeds.  Popular music is played loudly over
the soundtrack in the first part of the film, but much less so once
Pamela has made the transition.</P>
<P>     Some people tend to assume that in fantasy anything can happen
and there are few rules that need to be followed.  Actually just
about the opposite is true.  In the real world the apparently
impossible happens frequently.  In fiction authors are bound to be
at least believable, and fantasy writers have the strictest set of
rules of all.  Karmel has failed to observe the logic of her own
world.  Pamela discovers that there is no way to get back to her own
world from the world she was knocked into.  Even the street where
she lived does not exist in the new world.  Yet Pamela-2 seems to be
able to move between the two worlds without trouble.  Pamela's
replacement of Pamela-2 seems all too easy.  After a day or two she
seems to be able to function in the new world without suspicion
being raised.  There would be years of Pamela-2's experience that
would be a complete blank to Pamela.  People whom Pamela-2 would
know, Pamela would have never seen.  Even a tutored double can not
long stand in for the original without detection.  The self-
replacement theme was much better handled in the science fiction
film QUEST FOR LOVE or Akira Kurosawa's historical film KAGEMUSHA.</P>
<P>     In the end, Karmel seems to be telling us that whatever
alternative we have chosen, we will get some advantage and some
disadvantage.  Contrary to Frank Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, the
choices we have made have not all been for the best and the world is
not necessarily better for the choices we have made.  It is merely
different.  Karmel is telling us to stop regretting the past and to
make the best of what decisions we have made.  It is something of a
platitude, but there also is some truth there.  I would give ME
MYSELF I a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +1 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
