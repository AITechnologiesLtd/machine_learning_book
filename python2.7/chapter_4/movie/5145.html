<PRE>                                    FARGO
                       A film review by John Schuurman
                        Copyright 1996 John Schuurman</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Joel Coen; 
Screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen</PRE>
<P>I've tried hard not to take it personally but I'm very
unhappy with what the Coen brothers think of me. It's
just not flattering -- not at all. And I don't think
its only me. Believe it -- these two are misanthropes.
Their new movie proves,(as if "Blood Simple," "Raising
Arizona," "Miller's Crossing," and "Barton Fink" were
not enough), that the Brothers Coen don't like anybody
very much. They have employed their considerable powers
of cinematic storytelling to say so.</P>
<P>That they possess genius can not be denied. This film
will be studied in film arts classes for years. "Fargo"
is a beauty. It is rich, rich -- and powerful too. Some
of the images of the film continue to linger with me
now a week removed from seeing it. But I have found
little to cheer about here. I can urge no one to see it
other than film scholars and those theologians who
would like to see Romans 3:12-17 displayed on a big
screen: "They have together become worthless; there is
no one who does good, not even one. Their throats are
open graves .... Their feet are swift to shed blood;
ruin and misery mark their ways, and the way of peace
they do not know."</P>
<P>Joel and Ethan Coen have given us a humanity bereft of
any sign of a superior order. Their movie is a savage
comedy about the darkness/stupidity within. You laugh
and laugh at the dumb mid-westerners with their
befuddled look at life, (no doubt by necessity because
they are so numb with the cold of the frozen north). Or
else you are chilled with terror at the evil of which
they are capable. There is little difference between
"good" guys and "bad" guys. Everybody is stupid or
worse, rarely better. </P>
<P>Even seven-months-pregnant Police Chief Marge
Gunderson, cheery and chirpy and the best of the lot,
while smart enough to do respectable police work and
get her man in the end, is more laughed at than loved.
She captures the malevolent Grimsrud -- as lethal a
character as we have seen in some time, (and boy is
THAT saying something!) -- and while driving him to a
lock up lectures him on niceness and on how money never
really makes anybody happy. </P>
<P>Through the caustic hand of these film makers the moral
universe of which Marge is a relic is rendered inane.
She is the lone hint in this degrading film that there
is perhaps some sort of moral presence somewhere but
there is no cohesion to it and it comes off as cute
home town nostalgia. "No kidding. There really are
people who think like this too yet."</P>
<P>One more bizarre thing in an odd and troubling movie.
At the opening credits we are told that the following
is an entirely true story. It happened in Minnesota in
1987. "At the request of those living, the names have
been changed. Out of respect for the dead, it is told
exactly as it occurred." But then at the very end of
the credits at the conclusion we have the typical movie
disclaimer, stating that the film is entirely fiction,
that any resemblance to real people living or dead is
wholly accidental. It is one last thumb in the eye for
you from the Coen brothers. </P>
