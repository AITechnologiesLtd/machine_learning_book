                            FOUR DAYS IN SEPTEMBER</PRE>
<P>A tense film directed by Bruno Barreto, it recounts four momentous
days in Brazil in September 1969 when some dedicated but amateurish
young men and women decide to bring to the attention of the world
that Brazil had a military dictatorship and kept many left-wing young
people prisoner.   With all their efforts thwarted, with nothing they
do making world news, they decide to kidnap the American Ambassador,
Charles Elrick (Alan Arkin) and hold him hostage with threats of
execution if Brazil does not release its political prisoners.</P>
<P>The film is based on Fernando Gaberia's book, O QUE E ISSO,
COMPANHEIRO, (What's happening, Comrade?).    The script is by
Leopold Serran.   In fact, an actor portraying Gaberia, is a
principal character in the film.</P>
<P>To accomplish the kidnap and to call the military's torture of its
prisoners to the world, the amateur terrorists (revolutionaries?)
attempt a bank holdup.   While the true story of those four days is
an edge-of-the-seat story, it is also a human story, the important
parts taking place in the room of the house where the Ambassador is
being held.</P>
<P>Warned that each person must assume a pseudonym and further warned
that everyone must follow orders or risk being shot, the movie comes
down to these young people, idealists who realize they do not want to
die for the revolution.    It had not occurred to them only four days
ago that they might be caught and shot.    I knew people like that
who were in the Communist Party and gave up their parents and
friends, to disappear without so much as a "Good Bye"  to pursue "The
Cause."    That they later regretted what they had done is another
story and may make a good movie.</P>
<P>Alan Arkin plays the ambassador with great dignity.  He is even
sympathetic to the plight of these mostly young people.   The
Ambassador is against both the war in Vietnam and the military
dictatorship . . . but his job as Ambassador requires loyalty to his
government.</P>
<P>Pedro Cardoso has the role of writer Fernando Gaberia/Paulo.
Fernanda Torres is Maria 
Luis Fernand Guimares is Marcao
Claudia Abreu is Renee</P>
<P>A Brazilian film, in Portuguese with English subtitles.</P>
<PRE>               Beautifully directed by Bruno Barreto</PRE>
<P>Barreto does not allow any of his personal prejudices or political
beliefs to color the film. . . and for that he deserves much praise.</P>
