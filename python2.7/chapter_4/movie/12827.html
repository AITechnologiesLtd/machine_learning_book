<PRE>                          THE NEWTON BOYS 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                    1 :-) for Hillbilly bank robbers</PRE>

<P>What could possibly go wrong if your simplest philosophies in life were
- don't kill anyone and its okay to rob banks because they steal from
farmers? If you're wandering who I am referring to, its none other than
the infamous Newton brothers, those Yankee thieves who got away with
emptying the vaults of more than 60 banks across the nation, plus
pocketing more than 3 million big ones in their finale of a mail train
heist.</P>
<P>But to be honest, I had never heard of the NEWTON BOYS until today.</P>
<P>However, this does not pose as a problem, because when you realise that
this unique story is based on fact and not merely fictional, it makes it
all the more amazing. These boys on first appearances are genuine,
regular decent looking lads, who you would probably trust with looking
after your house if on holiday.</P>
<P>The cast is impressive. Matthew McConaughey heads this cast of young
popular Hollywood actors to hit the screen. He is Willis Newton, the
mastermind and motivator of the brothers. Ethan Hawke plays Jess Newton,
the carefree, less responsible brother with a sense of humour who
carries the same vein of womanising, heavy drunkeness of older,
irresponsible brother Doc Newton, played by Vincent D'Onofrio. Finally,
there is the sweet, good-natured Joe Newton played by Skeet Ulrich, who
is more even tempered here than when last seen in SCREAM.</P>
<P>Overall, an interesting historical dramatisation, for anyone interested
in a piece of American Hill Billy pop culture.</P>
