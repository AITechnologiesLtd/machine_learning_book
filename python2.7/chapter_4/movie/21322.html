 Screenwriters: Charlie Kaufman
 Country: USA; Year: 1999
 Rating (4 star system): ***1/2</PRE>
<P>             Here's a hint at how bizarre this film will become before
the end credits appear: the story starts to take shape around a love
triangle including, not three, but four people. You could probably call
the whole thing a descent into madness; or you could call it an ascent
into the mind of Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman.
             Jonze's direction is solid, but not really spectacular. It
keeps a good job of keeping the film together, something which, with the
elements of this film, probably proved much harder to do than can be
imagined. The relative calmness of the direction is the grounding wire
for the unbelievably creative, odd screenplay. This screenplay is one of
the most unique I remember seeing portrayed on the big screen. It would
have been very easy for a director to feel the urge to match the oddity
of the screenplay in his direction (and I'm sure the urge probably came
to Jonze), but Jonze does a magnificent job of keeping himself reeled in
enough that the screenplay does not get lost through misdirection and
confusion.
             So, obviously, I think the screenplay is the driving force
of this film. I can't even imagine the pitch that got this film made,
but somehow they found an executive with the guts to bet on something
new, and, in my opinion, it pays off. From the very first frames of the
film, it is clear that this film will be mostly unconventional. Every
environment is imbued with a bizarre energy that tends to charge the
events of the story taking place there. Every character is eccentric in
some way. Every plot point seems to take you somewhere new. I'd really
like to know what habits were involved in Kaufman's writing. Was it
written in stream of consciousness, then given structure? Does he have
an unhealthy obsession with John Malkovich or did he write it without
anyone in mind, then choose him? Suffice it to say that however he wrote
the screenplay, it works.
             And what of the actors? John Cusack is the lead, and among
the most eccentric characters. Just as Jonze's direction calmly grounds
the screenplay, Cusack seems to calmly ground the other actors around
him. His eccentricity isn't nearly as abrasive as the others, so he
serves as a good center to the story. The best performances were
probably those of Cameron Diaz and John Malkovich, himself. Diaz plays
very much against type, as the mostly unattractive, neglected housewife.
However, she's as eccentric as the rest of them and just becomes moreso
as the film goes on. Her performance has the right amount of subtlety
when needed, as well as excitement. Malkovich not only plays himself,
but variations of himself. The great thing is that he doesn't seem very
self-conscious, something which could have ruined the whole thing. He is
quite willing to make fun of himself as sacrifice for a good film, and,
in the meantime, he finds himself giving an excellent performance.
             It's good to see that such names as Diaz, Malkovich, and
Cusack are willing to make films like this. Hopefully they, and other
stars, will continue to bet on such unique material, allowing other
artists such as Jonze and Kaufman to continue creating such visions.</P>
