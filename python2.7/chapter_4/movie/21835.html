<P>Toy Story 2 is the perfect film to carry the Disney torch into the next 
century. Good old Walt's studio became synonymous with heartwarming and 
purely innocent children's fare during the last 75 years. Branches from 
the Mouse House like Touchstone and Miramax adapted to adult genres as 
well, making stirring and suspenseful dramas. This product of the Magic 
Kingdom isn't too lowbrow for adults nor highbrow for children; Toy 
Story 2 is the perfect family film and the happiest of all compromises.</P>
<P>"Back in 1995, retailers did not order enough toys to meet demand." Tour 
Guide Barbie speaks a truth that almost all of us remember vividly. 
(That was after Power Rangers and before Tickle Me Elmo.) It is no 
coincidence that this movie is opening twenty four hours before the 
year's biggest retail shopping day.</P>
<P>The original tale of the toys was a phenomenon. So was the original 
Austin Powers. Remember what happened when that sequel rolled around a 
few months back? It made more money in its first weekend than the first 
Austin Powers did in its entire theatrical run. And with Pokemon quickly 
fading after a huge opening, Toy Story 2 can expect enormous box office 
numbers, enhanced by retailers' ability to learn from their previous 
mistakes.</P>
<P>Woody (voice of Tom Hanks), Buzz (voice of Tim Allen) and the rest of 
the gang are all back for their next great adventure. This time around, 
the villain isn't the little boy next store, it is the big man with the 
toy store. Al (voice of Wayne Knight) spots Woody at a yard sale and 
realizes that our former hero is the missing piece to a very valuable 
collection. Soon Woody is abducted and living with the rest of the 
Roundup Gang, a series of dolls from an old television show that was 
canceled after its first week. Our new hero, Buzz Lightyear, jumps to 
the rescue explaining "Woody once risked his life for me. I couldn't 
call myself a friend if I weren't willing to do the same." He is joined 
by Mr. Potato Head (voice of Don Rickles), Slinky Dog (voice of Jim 
Varney, Rex the dinosaur (voice of Wallace Shawn) and Hamm the piggy 
bank (voice of John Ratzenberger). Their mission entails a venture 
across town and should they make an error the consequences are obvious: 
"ham sandwich with fries and a hot dog" plus a couple of toys for the 
not-so-happy meal.</P>
<P>Pixar, the animation company behind this feat, starts the movie with a 
short film. In the immediate wake of Pikachu's Vacation, a rather 
unfortunate opening piece from Pokemon: The First Movie (of course, 
everything in that movie is rather unfortunate), comparisons must be 
drawn. Toy Story 2's opening is a cute and very short sequence involving 
two lamps and two balls. It is introduced at Pixar's first film from 
1986 (most kids in the audience will likely group that year and the 
stone age next to each other). Pikachu's Vacation is an original piece 
that drags on for some 20 minutes and is absolutely indecipherable. 
Needless to say that quantity isn't quality.</P>
<P>Toy Story 2 also thrives off of sheer eye candy. The animation is so 
real that you often wonder if it really is animation or some sort of 
Roger Rabbit-like combination of cartoons and people. This is best 
highlighted by the ending sequence which takes place at (Caution: 
SPOILER ahead) an airport and a mid-feature scene with a major highway.</P>
<P>The gang is back and better than ever, there is no question about it. 
Buzz Lightyear says it best, this film is headed "to infinity and 
beyond!"</P>
