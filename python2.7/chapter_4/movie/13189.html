<PRE>                         WARRIORS OF VIRTUE 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
            5 :-( :-( :-( :-( :-( for ugly, butt kicking Roos</PRE>
<P>Cast: Mario Yedidia, Angus Macfadyen, Marley Shelton, Chao-Li Chi, J.
Todd Adams, Adrienne Corcoran, Doug Jones, Don W. Lewis, Jack Tate
Director: Ronnie Yu
Producers: Dennis Law, Ronald Law, Christopher Law, Jeremy Law, and
Patricia Ruben
Screenplay: Michael Vickerman & Hugh Kelley</P>
<P>If you thought THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES or POWER RANGERS were
bad, wait till you watch WARRIORS OF VIRTUE. This creation has sunk the
quality of children's movies to a new all time low. I should have seen
it coming and heeded my friend's warning. No good can come from butt
kicking kangaroos, carrying far-eastern religious philosophies.</P>
<P>The dialogue is so garbled, that one may perhaps gain the true meaning
behind the gibberish, if one was perhaps meditating on ‘Speed' and only
then if struck by lightning first. The ending comes as suddenly as
kangaroos becoming TRANSFORMERS. In this case, they merge into a bright
light and blast the bad guy into oblivion. What a major cop-out for an
ending!</P>
<P>As for each of the Roos – there are five of them, and each symbolises a
virtue that is colour coded - blue (water), red (fire), silver (metal),
green (wood) and white (air). They are all pretty lame (not to mention
stupid), except for great tail strength. As they started to annoy me
during the movie, I felt like tying them together and stringing them up
by their tails for a good Mexican Piñata.</P>
<P>Most annoying of all is the kid (Mario Yedidia) who finds himself lost
in the world of Tao. I detest whiny kids and this one isn't short on
that. Besides that, the director, Ronny Yu who is best known for his
Hong Kong fantasy, ‘kick flicks' ie THE BRIDE WITH WHITE HAIR, has made
this children's movie a little too outlandish for my taste.</P>
