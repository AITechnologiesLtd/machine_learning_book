<PRE>Dogma Review</PRE>
<P>  After seeing Dogma, I can't get it out of mind. The film is  filled with so
many messages and jokes, that I feel the need to see it again. Although Kevin
Smith brings some of the amateur humor along, he manages to maintain a clever
and sometimes provocative script that dares to be different.
  After all the controversy and arguments over Dogma, it quite surprisingly
paid off. While it is sure to offend some religious protesters, others may
understand what Smith was trying to express. I for one was completely
satisfied. Sure the film may be crude, but if you look closer, you will notice
that Smith was more or less mocking our world, than our religions. Like
Bartebly and Loki were saying, they can't believe how far our world has
dropped. People sinning left and right etc. To me this seems like a mockery of
how we treated God, or maybe not. It's just one of the many ideas floating in
my mind head about this film.
  The film opens with Bartebly (Ben Affleck) and Loki (Matt Damon), 2 angels
cast out of heaven for disobeying their Lord. They receive a letter about a
church that has a loophole that would bring them back to heaven. One thing the
letter fails to mention is the elimination of the world's existence, because
you can't betray God. So now our lives are in the hands of Bethany (Linda
Florentino),  Jay (Jason Mewes) Silent Bob (Kevin Smith), and The 13th Apostle
Rufus (Chris Rock). With the help of the voice of God (Alan Rickman), they can
save the world, but again they face another problem. It appears that Azrael
(The devil's muse) and a gang of thugs, will stop at nothing to let them enter
the church (because they would rather die then go to hell).
  The film is absurd on some levels, but there's so much to absorb here. That
was however a problem. Kevin Smith seemed a bit confused as well. It's like he
had too many ideas and made a mess of putting them together, but Dogma
straightens itself out. The same goes with the jokes. Just about everyone but
Jason Lee and Linda Florentino provide plenty of laughs to keep the film
flowing, especially Chris Rock. Speaking of Chris Rock, if it wasn't for his
presence, the film would have suffered badly. Since Linda Florentino was
totally miscast as the leading character, I was a bit worried that would permit
the film from flowing smoothly. Thankfully Chris came in the nick of time.
Although he wasn't his usual loud mouthed self, he still offered the most
entertaining scenes. The rest of the cast was good, but more notable were Matt
Damon and Ben Affleck. Although they were meant to be the villains, they
created some hilarious scenes, one of which includes a Mickey Mouse type of
animal named Mooby, undoubtedly a reference towards Miramax for turning the
film down because it was a Disney owned corporation.
  As I mentioned earlier, the script is very bold. You have to congratulate
Kevin on his achievement, even if you disliked it. What Kevin did was
brilliant, and this is without a doubt the best original screenplay of the
year. It most likely won't get nominated for an Oscar because of how harsh it
is, but I sure won't overlook it. 
  As for Kevin Smith, it's about time he has matured more. Once a comic book
nerd, now a respected director, I'm glad to see that he has stepped up. I will
be curious as to what approach he might take next. The sky's the limit.
  Crude and offensive it may be, but I love it. For once people should forget
about life and have an enjoyable time. After all, even "God has a sense of
humor."</P>
