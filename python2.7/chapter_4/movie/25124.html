<P>The media kit for "The Perfect Storm" begins with a special request that
reads, "Warner Brothers Pictures would appreciate the press' cooperation in
not revealing the ending of this film to their readers, viewers or
listeners." Fair enough, but for this to work, everyone needs to do his or
her part. So, if you are one of the millions who saw the news reports of the
event in 1991, or if you read Sebastian Junger's book on the subject, which
was on the New York Times bestseller list for over two years, remember:
Mum's the word.</P>
<P>I believe in revealing as little about a movie's plot as possible (and will
adhere to the WB guidelines in this review), but trying to hide the facts
about this widely reported news story strikes me as more than a bit silly.
Imagine the press kit for "Titanic" stating "Please don't tell anyone the
boat sank."</P>
<P>Incidentally, it appears that Warner Brothers forgot to make the same
request of their cast, because I've heard two actors spill the beans on late
night talk shows over the past week.</P>
<P>Set in Gloucester, Massachusetts, a major North Atlantic fishing port, "The
Perfect Storm" deals with those who make their livings from the sea and
focuses on a storm of almost indescribable ferocity, created when three
raging weather fronts collided. Pity the crew of the Andrea Gail, a
swordfishing boat that ventures hundreds of miles out in search of a big
catch. The storm hits full force just as their ice machine breaks down,
leaving the men with two choices: dump their lucrative boatload of fish and
venture even further out to sea in search of calm waters, or try to salvage
their income and pride by navigating through the worst storm in recorded
history.</P>
<P>Sitting in our comfy middle-class homes, we may consider the correct
decision to be painfully obvious. But as the film establishes during its
opening 40 minutes, these people live an extremely challenging life that
requires risks to be taken on a regular basis.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the screenplay fails to fully flesh out the men as
individuals. The extremely talented cast, led by George Clooney, Mark
Wahlberg and John C. Reilly, must deal with sketchily drawn characters. The
actors give it their all, but remain stereotypes rather than realized
individuals. The folks on the shore, including Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio
and Diane Lane, have little more to do than cry, shout and look worried.
Credit must be given to Rusty Schwimmer, a large woman with an incredibly
expressive face. When crew member Bugsy (John Hawkes) hits on her the night
before the Gail sets off to sea, she recognizes that his need goes beyond a
quick lay. In a quietly touching scene, she shows up dockside the next
morning so that he won't be the only man without anyone to see him off.</P>
<P>As for the storm, I found Wolfgang Petersen's direction so engrossing that I
failed to evaluate the quality of the special effects. The other critics in
attendance complained of numerous unconvincing images, but I didn't notice.
Several action set pieces are thrilling, particularly a shark attack on the
deck of the Gail, Captain Clooney's exploits while trying to repair a broken
mast, and the Coast Guard's amazing rescue efforts.</P>
<P>Speaking of the Coast Guard, a Discovery Channel documentary on the storm
identified the rescue crew by name and featured interviews with them. "The
Perfect Storm" would be a far more satisfying film had they made those Coast
Guard members as prominent, rather than using them as anonymous supporting
players. Unfortunately, to explain further, I would have to violate the
Warner Brothers request, but, after you see the movie, I'm sure you'll know
what I mean.</P>
