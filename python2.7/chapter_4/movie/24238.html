<PRE>Being John Malkovich
Directed by:  Spike Jonze
Starring: John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener,
John Malkovich, Mary Kay Place, Orson Bean
Running time:  112 minutes
My rating (5 star scale):  ***1/2</PRE>
<P>Craig (Cusack) is an unemployed puppeteer married to animal 
loving Lotte (Diaz).  Their house is a menagerie.  Craig is a 
good puppeteer, but his choice of material is bizarre and gets 
him beat up.  He finally caves in and looks for a job, 
following up on a peculiar ad for fast fingered, small 
statured people.  He reports to the 7 1/2 floor of an office 
building (the explanation how it got to have 7 1/2 floors is 
one of the film's funnier moments) and, after a bizarre 
conversation with a receptionist (Place) who can hear nothing 
correctly, gets the job.  In a few days, he makes two 
discoveries:  Maxine (Keener) with whom he falls desperately 
in love with and a door in his office which is a portal into 
John Malkovich's brain.</P>
<P>Things get increasingly complicated as Maxine wants to cash in 
on the portal, Lotte meets and also falls in love with Maxine, 
and Malkovich catches on to what is happening.  And then 
there's Lester (Bean), the mysterious businessman who hired 
Craig and may know more about all of this than anyone suspects.</P>
<P>The first half hour or so of this film is full of sly wit.  Not 
laugh out loud sight gags, but really funny moments that you 
have to pay attention to enjoy fully.  They range from Craig's 
bizarre puppetry, to the story behind the animals in Lotte's 
menagerie, to the story of the 7 1/2 floor, and finally to 
Maxine's very funny first date with Craig. But the final hour 
and a half is quite a disappointment.  Oddly, the film slows down
when we get into Malkovich's head.  It stops being a wacky comedy,
and that's certainly what this film should be, and tries to be 
a philosophical film with moments of humour.</P>
<P>Even that might have worked had the movie hit the right
philosophical note.  But it errs there.  Craig briefly discusses
the significance of having access to another person's brain and 
the responsibility of having such access.  Maxine ponders the
issue of being loved by two people and yet attracted to neither
alone and one only when within Malkovich.  Issues of gender
identity are briefly touched upon.  But the most interesting
issue that could have been raised, the issue of whether it is
right to sacrifice one person to save many others, is never even
mentioned.</P>
<P>I know many critics have praised this as one of the best movies
of 1999.  But I cannot understand why.  This is a moderately
funny film that never gets as surreal as its topic would allow
it to.  It's a film with a strong point to make which it never
makes.  It's a film with good actors giving good performances
for a failed cause.  It's worth watching, but not worth all the
hype.   </P>
