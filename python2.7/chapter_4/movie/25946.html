<P>    If you want to know how Blacks have been treated by
Whites in the music industry, you'd look for a revival of
August Wilson's play, "Ma Rainey"s Black Bottom," set in
1927 in a rundown recording studio in Chicago.  The drama
involves a White owner of a recording company and her
White manager plus Ma Rainey, a legendary blues singer
who is due to cut new sides of old favorites.  The play won
the prestigious New York Drama Critics Circle Award for its
portrayal of rage, racism, and the self-hate that racism and
exploitation breeds.</P>
<P>   If you want to know how stupid a movie can be, take in
"Turn It Up," Robert Adetuyi's lame attempt to expose, in
part, the roadblocks faced by an excellent hip-hop artist when
the only way he sees to raise the money needed to cut an
album is to take part reluctantly in criminal activities with 
his manager.</P>
<P>   A film with zero crossover appeal and limited allure even for
the targeted audience of boyz in the 'hood, "Turn It Up" plays
through every cliche imaginable with its clunky dialogue
highlighting a basically good guy, Diamond (Pras) who lives
in Brooklyn's East New York projects and hopes for a debut
CD that will break him out.  He is aided by his old friend
Gage (Ja-Rule), who is such a great buddy that anything
he might steal, any influence he might have, he is willing to
use for the benefit of his pal.  Since Diamond is aware of his
friend's devotion, he is willing to be dragged into Gage's
world of drug dealing, robbing, even tolerating the man's
murders.</P>
<P>   This good-friend bad-friend cliche--most recently used in
the arthouse movie "Orfeu" about a great musician who
remains devoted to his old drug-dealing buddy in the Brazilian
favelas of Rio--is just the beginning of the overdone motifs. 
Diamond's dad (Vondie Curtis Hall) wants to set his son
straight, but he's a flawed character as well having
abandoned the family some time back.  There's more. 
Diamond has a girl friend (Tamala Jones), who, like Dad, is
lobbying to put her man on the straight-and-narrow path but--
all together now--SHE'S PREGNANT!  What's a poor guy gonna
do?</P>
<P>   Filmed in New York and Toronto, "Turn It Up" does not
even enjoy an exotic Caribbean locale as did another turkey,
Chris Browne's "Third World Cop," and it sure as heck has
no-one who possesses the charisma that Sam Jackson gives
to the sizzling remake of "Shaft."  If anything will draw the
targeted audience, the special ingredient would be the
prominence of Prakazrel Pras Michel, a Haitian-American
rapper from the group called The Fugees, and Ja Rule, from
the group Cash Money Click.  Of course the soundtrack is
loaded with hip-hop performed by such artists as Tasha
Scott, D-Fuse and Rapper Noyd while the dialogue is equally
freighted with "shut the f*** up" and the like.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running time: 95 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
