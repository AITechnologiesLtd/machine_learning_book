<PRE>                           THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1991 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  A dark and fascinating thriller that is
     a genuine departure in the depiction of the psychopathic
     killer on the screen.  Hannibal Lecter is a screen villain as
     memorable as Norman Bates.  Rating: high +2 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     Since 1959 the psychopathic killer has, perhaps unfortunately, become a
staple of popular film.  Most films that had psychopaths before that point
really blurred the distinction between your garden variety murderer and the
actual psychopath.  Perhaps one notable exception was THE BAD SEED, which
suggested that there could be something like a "congenital evil."  Extreme
criminality and madness were very much equated.  That was very much what was
meant with "mad scientists" of the old horror films.  There was an urge to
deny the existence of evil or to relegate it to the supernatural.  How many
people even today deny the culpability of Adolf Hitler and say instead that
he was simply mad.  There were some films that suggested that there was
something more to criminal insanity than just extreme criminality, but it
was Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO that turned the cinematic view around.  Norman
Bates was himself a victim as well as the perpetrator of his acts.  Bates
was a normal person twisted by his past and driven by forces he could not
control.  This is a marvelously egalitarian view of the criminally insane.
It assumes that all men (and women) are created equal.  This is probably an
equally invalid view of the criminally insane.  When John Hurt played
Caligula in I, CLAUDIUS, he described his character as "congenitally
bonkers."  In all probability that was fairly accurate.  It is at least my
belief that Caligula was genuinely insane and Hitler was not.  This view of
the pitiful victim-psychopath became the dominant view in films with PSYCHO
and it has remained dominant.  With John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN (1978) there
was a new view, or perhaps an old view harkening back to medieval beliefs,
that the psychopathic killer is a supernatural force.  Fortunately, few
films have picked up on this idea and most that have have large Roman
numerals in their titles.</P>
<P>     Thomas Harris has a different concept of the psychopathic killer which,
if no more credible than the supernatural force, s at least more intriguing.
He created the idea in his novel RED DRAGON, which Michael Mann adapted into
his 1986 film MANHUNTER.  The idea was expanded in his SILENCE OF THE LAMBS,
which has been adapted into a film by Jonathan Demme.  Harris's concept is
that psychopaths have a distinctly different form of intelligence.  Their
reasoning power is consistent and logical, but alien to our own.  If you
cannot bridge the gap and think like a psychopath, you are at a distinct
disadvantage in dealing with them.  In addition, the psychopath often has
superhuman sensory powers.  For example, Harris's Hannibal Lecter, in
addition to a super-intellect, apparently has a heightened sense of smell.
I believe these are ideas that owe their origin more to Poe's "Tell-Tale
Heart" than to actual case histories.  But where Harris is really superb is
in being able to make Lecter's reasoning really seem brilliant.  It is
extremely difficult to write a character who is supposed to be brilliant.
To see how poorly it can be done, try going back and listening to Lex
Luthor's reasoning about Kryptonite in SUPERMAN (1978).  Lecter's reasoning
is at once perverted and brilliant.</P>
<P>     MANHUNTER and THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS are two of what have to be at
least four stories involving Hannibal Lecter.  And they are probably the two
least interesting.  When RED DRAGON begins, Lecter has already been captured
by Will Graham, who made himself into a psychopath in order to catch Lecter
in the first place.  Graham needs Lecter's help to capture another
psychopath.  In THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, fledging FBI agent Clarice
Starling (no pun intended) (played by Jodie Foster) similarly must enlist
Lecter's (Anthony Hopkins's) help to find a killer.  This time, however,
Lecter thinks he can work his own deal.  While this story does conclude,
there is still a major loose end that really demands yet another story.</P>
<P>     In this story the primary villain is a killer whom the press has dubbed
Buffalo Bill.  The killer not only murders his victims, he later skins them.
Starling is chosen to talk to Dr.~Lecter about the crimes with an eye toward
getting his unique insight into how to capture Buffalo Bill.  Starling,
however, has her own personal demons inside and Lecter is just the person to
turn those demons against her.  In the book the main story is how Starling
catches the killer, with the Lecter story being a major subplot.  The film
reverses the importance of the two plots by leaving the Lecter plot intact,
if not actually expanded, and cutting drastically the Buffalo Bill plot.</P>
<P>     The character of Lecter seems calculated to play off every anti-
intellectual prejudice in the audience.  The man is an ice-cold, emotionless
intellect.  He listens to ice-cold, emotionless music.  Even when he kills
we are told that he is ice-cold and emotionless.  In one chilling detail the
character is defined.  We are told that he attacked and partially ate a
victim without his pulse ever going over 80.</P>
<P>     Stylistically the film is well handled generally.  At times the music
is a bit overly dramatic in underscoring the mood as if Howard Shore, the
composer, did not trust Hopkins's acting to convey a mood of menace.  If
that was the case, the composer was misguided, since Harris's villain will
probably be as memorable as Norman Bates and Michael Meyers.  The
photography uses a filter to subdue the colors.  If that was not downbeat
enough, Starling is really the only sympathetic character in the whole
story.  She seems to go from one man to the next who tries to bed her.</P>
<P>     For the sake of completeness at least two nits should be mentioned.
Starling is first seen climbing a steep hill in the rigorous FBI training
school.  When we see her in close-up, she is wearing earrings.  For her own
safety, at least, you would think they would insist on no jewelry.  Also,
certain scenes are supposedly seen through an infra-red snooperscope and at
least one time the subject is in total darkness.  As seen through the scope,
even items that do not emit heat are easily seen.  In the total darkness
scene the subject can not only be seen, but also to be seen is the subject's
sharp shadow on the wall.</P>
<P>     THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is as unpleasant and hypnotic as watching a
cobra.  This is one heavy thriller.  I give it a high +2 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
