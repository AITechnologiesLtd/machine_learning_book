             BLAST FROM THE PAST
                A movie review by Joe Barlow
                    (c) Copyright 1999</PRE>

<PRE>            RATING: ** (out of a possible ****)</PRE>
<P>        "Blast From the Past" is the sort of film which makes
me pine for the bygone days of Hollywood, when studio-made
comedies were actually funny-- when wit and creativity, rather
than pratfalls and profanity, were the ingredients of
laughter.  "Blast From the Past" isn't the worst IQ offender
I've seen in recent months, although it may be the most
disheartening; after all, if a director is able to assemble
such a first-rate cast, why can't he give them a more
interesting story to tell?  Or at the very least, a more
interesting way in which to tell it?</P>
<P>        The tale itself certainly had potential.  In 1962,
as the Cold War continues to drag on, devoted family man
Calvin Webber (Christopher Walken) builds a luxurious,
self-sustaining fallout shelter beneath his modest California
home.  When the Cuban Missile Crisis hits its apex, Calvin
whisks his pregnant wife Helen (Sissy Spacek) into the
ground.  At that moment, a plane crashes into their house.
Calvin, detecting the flames and heat outside the shelter
door, naturally assumes that a nuclear bomb has been dropped
on the town.  Since the half-life of nuclear fallout is
thirty-five years, the couple begin their long wait...
unaware that the world above is perfectly habitable.</P>
<P>        Their son Adam is born almost immediately.  Lovingly
raised in this closed society and governed by his parents'
1962 morals and values, of which placing one's elbows on the
dinner table is the severest offense, Adam eventually grows
into an intelligent, polite young man (played by Brandan
Fraser), who, although happy, feels a sense of longing and
loneliness.  On his thirty-fifth birthday, he admits to his
mother that he's been thinking about girls "just these last
fifteen years or so."  And with these words, Adam is sent
out into the great big world to find his fortune.</P>
<P>        The problems begin with the story's pacing.  The film's
first-act is excruciatingly slow, due to the unnecessary amount
of exposition it thrusts upon us at the outset; indeed,
Brandan Fraser, the star of film, doesn't appear until nearly
30 minutes into the tale.  And the second-billed Alicia
Silverstone, who plays an unpleasant and unlikeable young
woman named Eve (the tale's requisite love interest), doesn't
appear until nearly a half-hour beyond *that*.</P>
<P>        Although Adam's adventures and interactions are
occasionally amusing, the story focuses on the wrong thing.
Rather than giving us insight into what he must be going
through psychologically, the film repeatedly tosses cheap
gags at the audience.  (An example: Adam has never heard a
certain four-letter expletive before, so his dad helpfully
explains that it's an archaic French word meaning "good."
Immediately we know that Adam will misunderstand and misuse
this word... not just once, but over and over.)</P>
<P>        There are a couple of excellent moments, where
Adam sees the sky (and later, the ocean) for the first
time; his sense of joy and wonder are contagious in these
scenes.  Had the film concentrated more on his feelings
and experiences rather than lame humor, it might have
been something special.  But these details are glossed
over: we don't feel a sense of awe when Adam meets another
human being for the first time.  After he gets lost in
the big city, we don't feel any sense of panic or terror
from him.  And when he sleeps at a hotel for the first
time, why don't we get a better sense of what he's feeling?
After all, this is his first night away from home!  (In its
defense, the film does mention this... but then it
immediately cuts to a scene required by the uninteresting
romance subplot, rendering Adam's emotions invalid.)</P>
<P>        The names of the characters (Adam and Eve) effectively
remove any suspicion about whether they will fall in love by
the end of the movie (and in case you miss it, one minor
character makes an observation that Adam's new home resembles
"the Garden of Eden").  But even without these clues, the
romance is foreordained: the film possesses neither the sense
of daring or originality needed to deviate from trite formula;
therefore, no matter how obvious it is to us that Eve is
completely wrong for Adam, she will eventually fall for the
big lug.  Cue the "happily ever after" music.</P>
<P>        "Blast From the Past" does succeed in generating a few
laughs, thanks to Fraser's effortless performance as Adam.
(Fraser has experience playing amiable goofballs, including
the title role in Disney's "George of the Jungle.")  His
effervescent charm is enough to make the movie bearable, but
only just.  That the film is as entertaining as it despite its
horrid screenplay is a powerful testament to Fraser's screen
presence.  The always entertaining Christopher Walken gives a
fun turn as Adam's quirky but well-meaning father.  But Sissy
Spacek feels miscast: at no time does she seem like anything
more than basic window dressing.  Come to think of it, that
criticism could be leveled at the entire film.</P>
<P>        It's a shame that this story wasn't handled with more
care, as it could've been fascinating.  A character study about
a family shut off from society for over three decades has the
potential for both humor and drama, though both are sacrificed
here for a formula romance that's neither involving or
convincing.  This story deserved better.</P>
