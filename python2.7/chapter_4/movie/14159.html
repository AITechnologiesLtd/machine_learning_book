<PRE>PI
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Darren Aronofsky makes his directoral debut with this uneven paranoid
thriller, Pi.  It's filled with plenty of new concepts and ideas, but
also with a healthy dose of pretension.</P>
<P>Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) is a brilliant mathematician on the borders of
madness.  He theorizes that since mathematics is the language of nature,
everything can be comprehended purely and completely on the basis of
numbers.  The key to understanding is to find the patterns that underlie
everything.</P>
<P>To confirm his theories, Max builds an archaic/state-of-the-art computer
system to crunch numbers on the stock market.  Once he discovers the
key, he should be able to predict stock prices at will.  But things
don't work out as smoothly as he plans.</P>
<P>He keeps running into a peculiar bug, one which may have caused his
mentor, Sol (Mark Margolis), to give up mathematics completely.  In
addition, he is being hounded by a rabid Wall Street exec (Pamela Hart),
as well as Lenny Meyer (Ben Shenkman), a man who believes Max's number
crunching can lead to the understanding of God.</P>
<P>Aronofsky has talent.  It's not every writer-director who could combine
topics as diverse as Fibbonacci numbers, phrenology, Kabalah, Chaos
Theory, numerology and Go into a single coherent (if not terribly
accurate) film. Plus, he is able to go a long way on a low budget,
producing some striking cinematography as he goes.</P>
<P>However, despite all of that, Pi fails as a film. There are two stories
in the film (Max and his theories, and Max and his descent into
madness), but neither one is satisfactory.  The former is implausible,
strains credibility, and is ultimately pointless.  The latter is more
interesting at times, but while it certainly gets disturbing at times,
it's all style and little substance.</P>
<P>Part of the problem rests with Sean Gullette.  As the lead character, he
is rather bland (particularly as a "mad mathematician").  None of the
actors in the film give stellar performances, but in an introspective
storyline, Gullette's performance is key, and not quite up to par.</P>
<P>Pi is stylistically interesting, but empty overall.  There's a thin line
between genius and incomprehensible madness. The film falls solidly in
the latter camp.</P>
