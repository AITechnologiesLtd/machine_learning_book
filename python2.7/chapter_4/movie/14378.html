<P>Films like Can't Hardly Wait are initially interesting to look at; not
because there is necessarily anything remarkable about them, but rather
because they position their main characters in or around the same
setting for almost all of their duration.  We've seen this style of film
work really well in, say, The Breakfast Club, and pretty awfully in
something like Kevin Spacey's Albino Alligator.  When a screenplay is
based on the actions of characters in secluded environments, one of two
things usually happen.  We are either given a dynamic understanding into
the thoughts and actions of the protagonists, or we are sadly exposed to
butt numbing scenarios of the same boringly conceived characters.  Can't
Hardly Wait finds itself with more of the latter than former, probably
thanks to the debut efforts of directors/writers Harry Elfont and
Deborah Kaplan.</P>
<P>Elfont and Kaplan's primary setting is a teenage post-graduation party
of booze and sex.  After all, drunks trying to get laid are, um, always
entertaining to watch.  Taking place at the party are plenty of well
known screen-party activities, which are given a new shining thanks to
some snappy camera shots, including an interesting way to introduce
important characters.  It all may look pretty and glossy, but under the
skin the screenplay falls flat on its face in terms of expressing itself
adequately.</P>
<P>By adequately, I mean actually doing something.  Most of Can't Hardly
Wait is spent pondering what could have been, and whilst I was watching
the characters party on, I couldn't help but feel that I was missing out
on something.  Looking back, I've figured out what it was: Can't Hardly
Wait never manages to find stable cinematic ground to stand on.  Elfont
and Kaplan probably had the best intentions at heart when putting pen to
paper, and I guess there first and foremost aim was to create a fun teen
comedy, perhaps in the style of a John Hughes film. Alicia Silverstone's
Clueless was intelligent enough to keep its material trashy but sly, and
Dazed and Confused skillfully introduced characters and setting, then
developed from there.  But Can't Hardly Wait is just trash and fun, and
neither is satirical or smart enough to make it worthwhile.  You could
say this film is a good example of a reasonable concept that is
developed without the skill or know-how that it desperately needs.</P>
<P>Jennifer Love Hewitt and Ethan Embry look charming together when they
are, actually, together - if only for a few minutes.  The rest of the
film, however, is pretty sober and dull, with many scenarios drawn out
way too long.  Can't Hardly Wait does succeed reasonably well with
audience entertainment, and although laughs are infrequent and the gags
are not particularly memorable, it's a little piece of shot-sized fun.
But all in all, if this is an example of what a new wave of teen's films
might look like, I can definitely wait.</P>
