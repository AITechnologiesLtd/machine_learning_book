<PRE>                         PICTURE PERFECT</PRE>
<P>If you are looking for a romantic comedy such as we used to get in
years long gone, this is it.  However, don't stop reading: PICTURE
PERFECT is modern in every way.   Given a cast that can do comedy,
screenwriters Arleen Sorkin & Paul Slansky & Glenn Gordon Caron
have come up with a sprightly, fast moving movie.</P>
<P>Kate (Jennifer Aniston) is a beautiful young woman with an
endearing smile.  She would be a cinch for promotion at her job
except that her boss, Mr. Mercer (Kevin Dunn) promotes only those
who are married, have responsibilities and will not readily quit
the job.</P>
<P>In the office is the Lothario, Sam (Kevin Bacon) who needs the
challenge of a woman who is married, encumbered.  Kate has a crush
on him but as she is single, she does not stand a chance.  Back at
home, Mama (Olympia Dukakis) keeps bugging her.  She wants a
grandchild.</P>
<P>To the rescue comes Darcy (Illeana Douglas) a friend and office
colleague who has the brilliant idea of taking a picture of Kate
and some handsome man at a party and having Kate pretend he is her
guy.  That should make the boss happy.  It also makes Sam happy
because now that Kate is engaged to be married, she falls into the
category that he likes.   Kate, for her part, likes this
arrangement because it has gotten her Sam.</P>
<P>Things begin to heat up when Kate has to produce, get off the
dime.  Everyone wants to meet her boyfriend Nick (Jay Mohr).  To
this end she offers to pay Nick to come to her city and pretend he
is her fiance.   But Nick has taken a liking to Kate . . . and who
can blame him?   He comes to her town but refuses to play her game
. . . and the comedy really takes off.</P>
<P>      Aniston is a delight to watch.  She is currently in TV's
FRIENDS and is scheduled to appear in several upcoming films.  Jay
Mohr is very handsome and personable.  You remember him from JERRY
MAGUIRE.  He will appear shortly in SUICIDE KINGS.  Kevin Bacon
was in APOLLO 13 as well as in many other films in as many
different kinds of roles.</P>
<PRE>       Go see this one.  It's a delight.</PRE>
<PRE>                  Directed by Glenn Gordon Caron.</PRE>
