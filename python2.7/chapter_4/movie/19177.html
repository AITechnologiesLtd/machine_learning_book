<PRE>                          THE HAIRY BIRD 1999
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1999 Timothy Voon
              3 out of 5 for the fight against co-education</PRE>
<PRE>Cast: Kirsten Dunst, Gaby Hoffmann, Heather Matarazzo, Monica Keena,
Lynn Redgrave
Director: Sarah Kernochan
Writer:    Sarah Kernochan</PRE>
<P>I had no idea that guys were referred to as hairy birds by girls (I can
only imagine why). More surprising still, I didn't think going co-ed was
such a big deal until I saw this movie. Being bred in an all boys
school, I can see the pros and cons of having the opposite around, but I
have no qualms either way.</P>
<P>So when Miss Goddards preparatory school for girls is being threatened
with the inclusion of boys, the loyalties of a group of close friends
become divided. On one side stands those immaculate virgins or those not
so immaculate, who are waiting to get laid by the first boy that comes
their way. In contrast there are those who do not want to be dominated
by boys (I'm not referring to lesbians), but believe that they should be
able to develop their aspirations in an environment free of the hairy
bird. So what follows is a high school romp not too dissimilar to the
Hayley Mills classic ‘The Trouble With Angels'. Only this time, the plot
is to save the school from boys, and this involves getting them drunk,
getting them into bed and making them purge on stage. All very wicked
and light hearted fun.</P>
<P>The cast includes the familiar faces of Kursten Dunst (Little Women),
Gaby Hoffman (Now and Then) and Lynn Redgrave, as the seemingly cold
head mistress who has a heart beneath a stone exterior. I think this
should be considered a girl's movie, because I really can't see the
average, non-new age guy caring a toot about why a school shouldn't go
co-ed, when bigger things like tits and buns are at stake. Not for the
average Jo, but it will tickle the fancy of women liberationists.</P>
