<P>LITTLE SISTER is a hard film to sit through, for many people not used to
film makers that love to take a total subjective point of view, for the
duration of the whole film. Not very many people have ever done this.</P>
<P>This film takes this point of view literally, and stays with it through the
end, which is a rarity in film making. For that alone, this film deserves a
special mention. It is difficult to find films that are capable of doing
this without ever having to go to the tripod for a standard shot. There  are
none of these in this film. The whole thing is hand held, and for what turns
out to be a superb reason, and magnificent conclusion, although some
will be terribly squeamish about it.</P>
<P>LITTLE SISTER, is the story of a brother and sister that have been close
friends for a long time, and at one time on her ninth birthday, perhaps a
little too close. But all of their adventures has been caught on film, by
mom and dad, and later by Martijn, who has taken up the camera for real,
although he does not discuss, or ever mention, that getting into film is
what he is about. The film suggests a slight abusive obsession
at first, and then begins to soften the stance once the story gets deadly
serious.</P>
<P>The older brother, still, appears attached to his younger sister, now a
woman, and he follows her around, in a rougher style than that of Mike
Leigh, another film maker for subjective ideals. Martijn keeps the camera up
close to his sister for the whole film, and follows her around.</P>
<P>Eventually it creates a few difficult situations, by walking in when she is
making love to her boyfriend, and also doing a no-no, later on, which
causes the transition in the film.</P>
<P>Eventually, the situation gets around, and Martjin, is forced to try and
figure out why he has become the way he has. He has failed in his
relationship or marriage ( not clear ), and the reason may have been that he
never got a sense of what it felt like to hold someone you really like, in
this case the situation going back to when his sister was nine years old,
and they got caught in the same bed.</P>
<P>The film now enters a very touchy area. And it takes the older sister to
literally sacrifice herself to try and help her brother. As it turns out,
however improper the situation is, it does not go beyond the point of no
return, and the suggestion is that Martjin has learned something, and that
Daantje, is finally freed of her brother with the camera in hand, who  tried
to break the relationship with her boyfriend, in what may have  amounted to
jealousy.</P>
<P>And in a fitting end, after the real touching, and touchy fifteen minutes,
Martijn gets up and out of the bed to turn off the camera for the last time.
For once, he was not abusive, and we can see that he has changed. He may not
have conquered his fears, but his following his sister and bothering her is
over for sure. She had to go through a rather uncomfortable moment which
might have turned the wrong direction, but it did not, and her way of
helping her brother displays a little bit more of love and care for him than
he has through his obsessive behavior.</P>
<P>At this point we can only hope that things get resolved, but there is no
reason to think that they will not.</P>
<P>It is clear that in those areas, sexual mores and attitudes are a bit easier
than the Christian morality found in many other parts of the world. But,
regardless, there are some things that affect individuals, and this film
keeps it strictly "individual", mostly because of its camera style.</P>
<P>While, very often, the camera can be a bit odd, and off the mark,
nevertheless, this is the strong point for this film in its desire  to make
a point. The point may be just this one person and his behavior have to
learn a lesson, and he does. The relentless use of the camera, to see things
like the eye truly does, is a refreshing style, over that of the average
film. And the director and actors seem to be aware of this and take it upon
themselves to make sure that this drama develops seriously and force a
serious conclusion to it.</P>
<P>It is the danger in these conclusions, that one, or both, could wind up
dead, but Daantje has succeeded where her brother has failed. His childlike
playfulness has been used as an excuse for his insecurities, and his choice
of moments defines that there is something there that he is in dire need to
resolve with his sister, although it may not be pleasant. His sister gives
in, but she doesn't fall apart at all. She is the stronger of the two, and
does not use a camera to hide behind her fears.</P>
<P>An absolutely riveting film, that is very difficult to accept and appreciate
because of its immediate link to what may be an incestuous relationship. But
I don't know that two children should be punished for a moment of innocence,
which may hurt them later, and in this case hurt Martijn seriously. And in
the end, when the situation has to come to a head, we are teetering on the
edge of our seats, scared shitless of what the outcome may be.</P>
<P>The film suggests here and there that the brother and sister have had a
connection before, but I really do not see that any of these moments were
any more than a teasing, or pleading to get attention, by Martijn.</P>
<P>Strong film that turns the tables mercilessly. Content may be inadvisable to
some. Other than that, it is very well done and thought out. Exceedingly
well designed by the director to bring about a turnabout ending to the
story.</P>
<P>Not for everyone due to subject matter of implied incest. Excellent film
otherwise.</P>
