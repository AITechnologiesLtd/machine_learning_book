<PRE>TRIXIE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>In writer/director Alan Rudolph's TRIXIE, two-time Academy Award nominee
Emily Watson plays Trixie Zurbo, a likable and feisty woman who refers
to herself as "a private defective." She's a working-class gal on her
first case as she tries to find a mysterious tape that has something to
do with a slimy politician, Senator Avery (Nick Nolte).  In this sweet
screwball comedy, Trixie has never met a sentence that she couldn't
fracture.  ("You've got to grab the bull by the tail and look it in the
eye." "I've got an ace up my hole.")  One of the movie's chief delights
is listening for what will come out of her mouth next.  Her penchant for
mixed metaphors becomes catching, and other characters begin to speak
Trixie's brand of gibberish.</P>
<P>Other members of the excellent cast include a greasy-haired,
self-proclaimed ladies' man (Dermot Mulroney), a badly-dressed, crooked
developer (Will Patton), a drunken comic (Nathan Lane), an underage
barfly (Brittany Murphy) and a wasted, would-be singer (Lesley Ann
Warren).  All of the cast nicely complement Watson, as it is her movie,
and watching her is a real treat.  From BREAKING THE WAVES on, she has
shown that she is an actress with an amazing breadth who never gives
anything less than her all.  Even in underwritten roles (ANGELA'S
ASHES), she makes her parts special and compelling. With TRIXIE we learn
that she can be funny as well as dramatic.</P>
<P>TRIXIE runs 1:57.  It is rated R for some language, sexuality and
violence and would be fine for most teenagers.</P>
<P>The film will be playing as part of the San Francisco International Film
Festival (<A HREF="http://www.sfiff.org">http://www.sfiff.org</A>), which runs April 20 to May 4, 2000.  It
is scheduled to be released nationwide in the United States this June.</P>
