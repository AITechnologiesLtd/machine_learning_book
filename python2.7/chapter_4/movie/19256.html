<PRE>_American_Pie_ (R) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>If you see the trailer for _American_Pie_ in the theatre, temporarily
leave the auditorium.  If you see the commercial on TV, change the
channel.  This raucous teen sex comedy's most powerful weapon is the
element of surprise--a tactic that, based on their full disclosure
marketing campaign, Universal seems intent on ruining.</P>
<P>But even if you have already caught a glimpse of an ad or two, there are
still a good amount of big, unexpected laughs in this unapologetically
raunchy romp from screenwriter Adam Herz and director Paul Weitz, both
making their debuts in their respective fields.  What isn't so
unexpected, however, is the thinness of the premise.  Four seniors (Jason
Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, and Eddie Kaye Thomas) vow to be
virgins no more after prom night.  C'est tout.</P>
<P>It's not like anyone buying a ticket to _American_Pie_ is looking for
plot innovation; they are looking to laugh, and indeed they will.  Along
the way, though, viewers will be meet a variety of keenly defined
characters--an uncommon occurrence in this era of _Can't_Hardly_Wait_s
and _She's_All_That_s.  The focal guy is Jim, a nice, if bashful and
hopelessly desperate (as evidenced in the infamous scene that lends the
film its title) guy made very sympathetic by Biggs, who is like a younger
and much more likable David Schwimmer.  Thomas's mochachino-drinking
Finch is given the last amount of screen time of the four, but, like the
even more peripheral players, such as sex advice-dispensing Jessica
(Natasha Lyonne) and gabby geek Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), he carves out
a memorable niche.</P>
<P>The same goes for Oz (Klein), the jock who turns over a sensitive new
leaf en route to the big score; and Kevin (Nicholas), who is anxious to
go all the way with his girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid).  But their
respective plot threads eventually point up to _American_Pie_'s
shortcoming.  Oz's newfound gentle side wins him the genuine affection of
jazz ensemble singer Heather (Mena Suvari), and he finds himself feeling
the same way; and issues of true love play a major role in the
Kevin-Vicky relationship.  Needless to say, these forays into more
earnest territory don't quite gel amid the air of tawdriness.</P>
<P>Audiences will be too busy eating up the many hilariously inspired
moments in _American_Pie_ to remember, let alone think, about any serious
issues it misguidedly touches upon.  That's the whole point of the
exercise, anyway--having a good time, and audiences are certain to have a
blast.</P>
