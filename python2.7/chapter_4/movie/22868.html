<P>There is a school of thought that believes striving for reality in art is not 
a worthwhile pursuit. I've never understood why; we live in reality, we 
connect with it, it's exciting. Think of all the types of situations you find 
yourself in every week -- there'll always be some forms of happiness, 
sadness, expectation, disappointment, serenity, tumult, calm and anger. Life, 
to use a horrible cliché, dear friends, is an emotional roller coaster!</P>
<P>"Wonderland" is glorious proof of that, a film of scruffy beauty and 
spellbinding power, which seems constructed to capture the appeal of 
eavesdropping. That pastime is involving, of course, because of our 
instinctive fascination with humanity; this movie uses the same hook, diving 
into the lives of several Londoners, all of whom are connected by family 
ties, but are at different stages of their lives and have different 
occupations.</P>
<P>Nadia (Gina McKee) is an attractive but lonely waitress, who places a lot of 
personal ads but allows herself to get upset every time she goes on a date. 
One of her sisters, Molly (Molly Parker), is married and pregnant; the other, 
Debbie (Shirley Henderson), is raising her son alone. Their parents are 
Eileen (Kika Markham) and Bill (Jack Shepherd), two pathetically unhappy 
people who mope around the house, and occasionally cringe; because of barking 
dogs, broken appliances, boredom or simple fear of leaving the house.</P>
<P>We also meet up with partners and ex-partners, friends, acquaintances, 
neighbours, estranged relatives, colleagues... "Wonderland" never announces 
itself as a definite study of anything in particular, which gives it the 
freedom to roam around, to spy on whomever's interesting.</P>
<P>The director, Michael Winterbottom, shoots everything in a grainy, hand-held, 
almost camcorder style which makes events seem imparted to us from the inside 
out, rather than staged and shot. It's as if invisible camera crews had been 
ceaselessly exploring London. It's essential to the sense that we're watching 
real people who aren't aware of our presence.</P>
<P>This could have come across as solemn and grimy, like any of those pathetic 
TV documentaries that follow losers around their places of work and play. But 
in between the quiet, sober scenes are astounding sequences where the camera 
submerges in neon light, the editing plays around with cutting and speed, and 
Michael Nyman's grand score soars on the soundtrack. The whole movie uses 
London as a backdrop, letting us unconsciously absorb it; these grand musical 
moments explicitly rejoice in the city's strange beauty, and announce that 
the film is not scrutinising life, but gazing at it in wonderment.</P>
<P>So music is an important tone-setter in "Wonderland" -- but it's always kept 
for these side-moments, and never interferes with the drama. Scenes do not 
follow typical Hollywood constructions; there isn't a little climax every 
five minutes, characters don't subtly recap their situations to each other to 
let the audience know what's going on. Everything plays out at a realistic 
pace, and we get our bearings by picking up on mood, tone, emotions. 
Winterbottom, his actors, and even his extras, have a knack for capturing the 
way conversational rhythms actually do sound -- in homes, hairdressers' shops 
and pubs; on dates, the phone, and everywhere else the story goes.</P>
<P>And that is why this beautiful film has been made. It is a devoted record of 
modern human behaviour. I dreaded that there would be some hugely 
inappropriate surprise plot development near the ending, but no -- 
Winterbottom and screenwriter Laurence Cordiat know that most of us don't end 
a typical weekend by stumbling into life-changing experiences. "Wonderland" 
is such an acute observance of people that it makes us confront our essential 
feelings about our fellow man. And to any foreigners out there, wondering 
what it's like to be in Britain -- just take a look at this movie.</P>
