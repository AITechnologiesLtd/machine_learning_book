<PRE>Affliction
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1999 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (Out of ****)</PRE>
<P>One of the most frightening occurrences in nearly every adult's life happens
in front of the bathroom mirror. While shaving or applying lipstick, you'll
catch a glimpse out of the corner of your eye. One of your parents is staring
at you from behind the glass.</P>
<P>Most people's childhood memories of their parents are of ancient people in
their thirties or forties. When the child reaches that age, his self-image is
rarely that...then there's that vision in the mirror.</P>
<P>While we may be fated to look like our parents, we don't have to become them
if we don't want to. Most of the time, though, DNA isn't all that's replicated
in children.</P>
<P>Small town cop Wade Whitehouse (Nick Nolte) hates his abusive alcoholic father
Glen (James Coburn), yet every day Wade becomes more and more Glen. Although
the broken-down man is on his last legs, he dominates his son's life.</P>
<P>Wade is stuck in a dead-end job in a dead-end town. He's primarily a school
crossing guard and his other part-time job consists of running errands.</P>
<P>He's destroyed two marriages to the same woman. His young daughter assures him
that she loves him, but doesn't want to spend time with him.</P>
<P>Wade's one place of refuge is with girlfriend Margie (Sissy Spacek), a
waitress at the local diner. He's unconsciously working on sabotaging this
relationship, himself.</P>
<P>He sees a chance to change all of this when a wealthy visiting union official
is killed deer hunting. It's ruled a hunting accident, but Wade uncovers clues
that it might be a mob hit.</P>
<P>Until the end, it's uncertain whether it was an accident or Wade is onto the
truth. Maybe he's finally gone off the deep end. It's possible he's created
this drama to take his mind off his own desperation.</P>
<P>The film is less about the mystery than it is about Wade. It paints a vivid
portrait of a man struggling with overwhelming personal failures. To top it
all off, he has a toothache that won't stop.</P>
<P>Nolte is astonishing in the role. He transcends "Nick Nolte" and becomes Wade.
It's no wonder that he won New York Film Critics and National Society of Film
Critics awards and was nominated for an Oscar.</P>
<P>The casting of Coburn is inspired. The two look and act enough alike that it's
easy to believe they are related. His Supporting Actor Oscar is well-deserved.</P>
<P>Screenwriter/director Paul Schrader is in touch with males on the verge of
madness. His scripts for "Taxi Driver" and "Raging Bull" lead directly into
this one.</P>
<P>The film is filled with chilling scenes. As in <I>Fargo<I>, the town is
constantly snow-covered. Released widely during the first week of spring when
the audience is yearning for warmer weather, the movie is a reminder of the
long hard winter just past.</P>
<P>Some events are archetypal of dysfunctional families. Brother Rolfe (Willem
Dafoe) who escaped by leaving town, denies childhood incidents ever happened.
Glen seems to have been abused by _his_ father. After Wade pulls a man over
the cafe counter and pins him down, he holds his daughter telling her, "It's
all right. That didn't happen. That didn't happen."</P>
<P>Wade sits at his parents kitchen table calmly drinking a glass of whiskey.
Through the window his father's ramshackle barn burns in a field of bleak
white. The scene is eerily unsettling and says it all.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for over 23 years and is growing
increasingly weary of dismal films no matter how well crafted they are. He's
currently looking for something in the light-hearted adventure genre.
