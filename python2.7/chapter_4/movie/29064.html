<PRE>OSMOSIS JONES
A film review by Norm Schrager
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Have you ever wondered what goes on in the back of your nose when you
sneeze?  The Farrelly Brothers have.  And in their traditional gross-out
fashion, they'd like to show you.</P>
<P>There you have Osmosis Jones, a combination of clunky live action and
cool, creative animation that tries too hard to please both adults and
kiddies while journeying inside one disgusting body.</P>
<P>That body belongs to Frank the zookeeper (Bill Murray), a greasy,
out-of-shape, wart of a single Dad.  He doesn't exercise, his hygiene
sucks, and he eats food that's fallen to the ground.  Once we're
introduced to his unpleasant exterior, we quickly meet his vile
interior.</P>
<P>In a few ingenious animated sequences, Frank's insides literally burst
to life as the "City of Frank," complete with its own infrastructure,
police department, and greedy, corrupt mayor (nicely overdone by none
other than the voice of William Shatner).  Frank's white blood cells,
led by super-slick upstart cop Osmosis (voiced by Chris Rock), fight a
constant, border patrol-style battle against invading germs and
diseases.</P>
<P>The central story is a gentle spoof of buddy cop movies:  Jones teams up
with a high-powered cold capsule named Drix (voiced by the steady,
deadpan David Hyde Pierce) in an attempt to shut down a renegade virus
(played with a mean funkiness by Laurence Fishburne).  This nasty
illness is looking to make history by offing Frank in just 48 hours, and
this unlikely duo must stop him.  Even if their "fantastic voyage" takes
them into a seedy nightclub in one of Frank's zits.</P>
<P>The animation, directed by former story artists Piet Kroon (The Iron
Giant) and Tom Sito (Antz), is wonderfully colorful and energetic,
looking like a spiffed-up Merrie Melodies cartoon.  In fact, some of the
more harmless germs look like those little aliens in another
half-animated Warner movie, Space Jam.</P>
<P>The biology puns, both visual and vocal, are there as is expected, with
plenty of requisite references to a litany of bodily functions including
peeing and puking (the rule seems to be: the more liquid and mucus, the
better).</P>
<P>But with all the endless opportunity to jam-pack both the frame and the
script, Osmosis Jones is surprisingly tame.  The Farrellys, and
first-time screenwriter Marc Hyman, almost appear to be holding back,
not wanting to give the smaller viewers (this is PG-rated) sensory
overload.  The filmmakers would rather devote their time to juicing up
the urban, radio-friendly soundtrack, which becomes so blatant it's
annoying.  So in peeling back some of the laughs, Osmosis Jones becomes
just a handful of chuckles by the film's end.</P>
<P>It does manage to hold interest until then, even if the live-action
sequences with Bill Murray and daughter Elena Franklin feel quickly
cobbled together and look dreadfully grainy and flat (I think all the
money was spent on the animated bits).  Molly Shannon, as the daughter's
teacher, is a riot, happily stealing both scenes in which she appears.</P>
<P>And, as in any movie aimed toward kids, and doubly so if directed by
guys named Farrelly, you'll find just about every yucky body release
imaginable.  But, what's this?  No fart jokes?  Oh, they save those for
the end.  No pun intended.</P>
