<PRE>                               CHAIN REACTION
                       A film review by Mike Joyce
                        Copyright 1997 Mike Joyce</PRE>
<P>Chain Reaction attempts to combine the action, suspense, thriller and
political intrigue genres. It tries too hard to combine all these aspects
leading to a complex plot with too many twists to be believable. The story
revolves around a Hydrogen Energy Project aimed at producing mass, clean,
free energy by causing a chain reaction in Hydrogen. Eddie Kasalivich
(Keanu Reeves), a machinist and physics student with the Project, discovers
the right frequency in order to cause a stable chain reaction to take
place. Following this success, the head physicist of the Project is
assassinated, and the workshop blown-up. Eddie Kasalivich and Lily Sinclair
(Rachel Weisz) the head physicist's assistant are framed for the
assassination and explosion. This leads to a huge chase, in which the FBI
attempt to track down and capture Eddie and Lily (who predictably become
closer as they flee together). In this respect the film is reminiscent of
The Fugitive, and this is little wonder given that the director (Andrew
Davis) also directed The Fugitive.</P>
<P>Shannon (Morgan Freeman) is the head of the "Foundation", an underground
operation which attempts to replicate the Hydrogen Energy Project. However,
they need Eddie Kasalivich, as he is the only person who knows the correct
frequency. It is here that the plot becomes twisted, and it is hard to
follow. Shannon was involved in the original Hydrogen Energy Project, but
we now find him involved in this underground operation which at first we
are lead to believe is privately funded for power and money. Next we
discover that the C.I.A. is somehow linked to the project, and that free
energy cannot be released upon the world because it will cause a crash of
world economies and lead to recessions, or something. The plot is too hard
to believe, that is, if you can follow it. Performances are reasonably
solid, and the actors do their best with the script. At times the action is
thrilling, however, it has all been done and seen before.</P>
