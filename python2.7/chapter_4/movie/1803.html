<P>     In the early years of the Twentieth Century, on a small ranch in
Mexico, the story of three sisters and their repressive mother
unfolds.  Tita (Lumi Cavazos) is the third and youngest daughter of
Mama Elena (Regina Torne) and as such, because of a family tradition,
she is forbidden to marry or have children until after her mother's
death.  Tita is agreeable to this situation until she falls in love
with the dashing young Pedro (Marco Leonardi).  When Pedro learns that
he cannot marry Tita, he agrees to an engagement with her older sister
Rosaura (Yareli Arizmendi) in the hope that by marrying her, he will be
given ample opportunity to spend time with his real love.</P>
<P>     An admittedly unusual title for a film, LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE
fits the mood of the movie--odd, playful, and sweet.  It equates the
boiling point of water for hot chocolate with the height of passion in
male/female relationships.  With occasional surrealistic fantasy
sequences interspersed between the commonplace goings-on of regular
lives, the film has a way of enchanting the viewer--until a
disappointing end.</P>
<P>     Although it deals with some potentially-weighty subjects--death
being a prevalent theme--LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE is surprisingly
light-hearted.  It manages to find the funny side of almost any subject
or event.  That isn't to say that darker emotions are not expressed,
because they certainly are, but they are kept from dominating.</P>
<P>     There's a lot of passion expressed in LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE.
Love and the rebellion of youth are two of many subjects tackled by the
film.  The tragedies and ecstasies of both are confronted.  We are
given an opportunity to see how the attitudes of the characters change
over time and how true love, once revealed, can never be held back.</P>
<P>     The greatest weakness of this movie is its ending--and not only
the final scene, but the ten-minute "epilogue."  The last part of LIKE
WATER FOR CHOCOLATE takes place twenty years beyond the rest of the
film.  The transition in time is jarring--I was momentarily
disoriented, and the ultimate thrust of these final events seems a
trifle silly.  While they don't destroy the movie, they reduce its
overall impact.  Many will find a natural sense of closure in the way
that Arau has chosen to conclude his film, but it's a little too hard
for me to swallow.</P>
<P>     A recurring metaphor in LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE is food (the
title is a good tip-off of that).  Hardly a scene goes by without
someone eating or preparing a meal and some of the film's more
hilarious sequences surround a pair of banquets.  Each of these scenes
has a meaning beyond the obvious, however.  Food is equated with life
and vivacity, two subjects into which this movie delves.</P>
<P>     One of the best films to come out of Mexico in years, LIKE WATER
FOR CHOCOLATE is in every sense an "art film."  Possessing an
almost-ethereal quality, it is not every man's "cup of tea."  However,
those with a penchant for these sorts of films--offbeat, quirky, and
subtly emotive--will almost certainly accept LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE
as something of a rare treat.  Too bad the ending couldn't have been a
little better grounded.</P>
