<PRE>Swiri (1999)
* * *
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 2000 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>"Swiri" broke all box-office records in its native South Korea when 
it was released, outgrossing even "Titanic".  Its US$2.2M budget made 
it the most expensive Korean movie yet (with a good chunk of the 
money put up by Samsung, whose logos feature predominantly 
throughout).  Maybe it's not surprising that the movie in question 
was created in blatant imitation of the slick Hollywood products it 
would be forced to compete with in Korean theaters.</P>
<P>What we have here is pretty much a Korean take on the 
Simpson/Bruckheimer formula: a fast-moving thrill machine with slick 
visuals, tons of action, and a certain amount of sentiment (in this 
case, a 'cross-the-border love story).  It works as entertainment, 
and people who've never seen a Korean movie in their lives will be 
able to dive right in.  But it's resoundingly hollow.</P>
<P>The first few scenes are shatteringly violent, showing North Korean 
prisoners being used as training dummies in a sickening covert-ops 
exercise.  One of the spies is Hee, a North Korean female 
sharpshooter who's being sent South to perform assassinations.  (The 
movie misses a bet by not having her leave a calling card at every 
killing, but I guess they figured even that would have been 
excessive.)  The hero is Won, a South Korean special agent who's been 
on the tail of Hee for quite some time.  He suspects a leak in his 
department when one of their contacts is gunned down in front of 
them, and stumbles into a plot that (MacGuffin time!) involves a 
special chemical bomb that can level city blocks.</P>
<P>The movie wastes no time in deciding if it's going to be a political 
thriller or a shoot-em-up -- we get a token amount of pontificating 
and introspection about the North and South, and then gobs of 
gunplay.  There is also time for a romance between two major characters, all
the pieces of which are out of the standard kit of movie love stories.  We
do get an explanation of the cryptic title, though -- although it's less
than edifying, and more than a little maudlin.</P>
<P>And for a movie that comes from completely outside Hollywood, it's funny how
many of the cliches are here. True to form, any movie that mentions a bomb
and that does not provide at least one building being blown up is cheating
us, and we do in fact get exactly that (although it would be criminal of me
to see which one or when).  We also get the handy Aquarium Rule (thank you,
Roger Ebert), which dictates that any movie with aquariums in it is going to
have them shot to pieces.  Speaking of visual cliches, if I see one more
shot of a door being kicked  open by a bunch of guys with flashlights
strapped to their guns, I'll puke.  We get that three times here.</P>
<P>I liked "Swiri" without ever really getting involved in it.  It's a 
well-made exercise; it looks and sounds as good as anything Hollywood 
ever put out.  If it were released here in a dubbed edition, it might 
do fairly well.  In fact, director Kang Jae-gyu has hinted that was 
exactly his aim.  But it's a little saddening how unadventurous it 
really is.  Korea has managed to produce one of the best, most 
thoughtful films of all time ("Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the 
East?"); with "Swiri", it's clear they can make big entertainment 
machines as well.  Here's hoping they keep it on an even keel.</P>
