<P>     THE PELICAN BRIEF is the second John Grisham novel to make the
book-to-movie transition.  Like its predecessor THE FIRM, it
disappoints, which isn't such a big surprise considering the pedestrian
story upon which it is based.  Instead of wondering why Grisham's work
doesn't translate well to the screen, maybe someone should take a step
back and consider whether his page-turners are worth filming in the
first place.</P>
<P>     On one bloody May night, two Supreme Court Justices are
assassinated (one of whom is played by Hume Cronyn).  At Tulane
University, law student Darby Shaw (Julia Roberts) has a theory about
who's responsible for the killings.  Using the resources of the school
library and several semi-public court case files, she develops what is
later dubbed as "The Pelican Brief."  Initially regarded as a wild
theory, the short document comes under scrutiny when readers of Darby's
work start getting murdered--beginning with her Constitutional Law
professor, and lover, Thomas Callahan (Sam Shepard).  As the nameless
thugs close in, Darby turns to WASHINGTON POST writer Gray Grantham
(Denzel Washington) for help.  Naturally, this makes Grantham as much
of a target as Darby, and the pair end up on the run.</P>
<P>     In the book THE PELICAN BRIEF, the particulars are different from
those of THE FIRM, but the basic premise is very similar.  Grisham
apparently has one basic story that he likes to dress in different
clothes.  That's all right, and it makes for quick, brainless reading,
but neither of the movie versions has worked.  Paradoxically, THE
FIRM's biggest failing is in straying too far from the written version
while THE PELICAN BRIEF's flaw is in remaining too faithful.</P>
<P>     As scripted and directed by Alan J. Pakula, THE PELICAN BRIEF is a
straightforward visual re-telling of Grisham's book.  With few changes,
it follows the basic storyline, and includes a number of complications
and secondary characters which seem superfluous on screen.  The final
result is an unnecessarily-long thriller that contains far more talking
than action.  Pakula's direction is lackluster, showing little of the
style that permeated his two most impressive pictures, ALL THE
PRESIDENT'S MEN and PRESUMED INNOCENT.</P>
<P>     Character depth and development are virtually nonexistent.
Grisham's book isn't a tremendous achievement in this area, but at
least we get some insight into what various people are thinking.  With
that element absent in the movie, no one attains more than a
two-dimensional status, and much of the entertaining in-fighting and
political wrangling is lost to the viewer.  John Heard's Gavin Verheek
is a perfect example.  In the book, we get to know him.  In the movie,
he's in about five scenes before meeting his fate.</P>
<P>     The supporting cast is impressive, with names like Robert Culp,
John Heard, Sam Shepard, and John Lithgow all turning in solid
performances.  Likewise, Denzel Washington brings a calm
self-possession, bordering on arrogance, to the role of Gray Grantham.
This may be the only film character to approach the level of the book
version, and much of it can be credited to Mr. Washington's work.</P>
<P>     Julia Roberts' Darby Shaw, however, is an unmitigated disaster.
Ms. Roberts simply doesn't have the range required for the role, as
becomes painfully obvious when she's supposed to express terror at a
car bombing.  That particular scene, as well as several others
requiring deep emotional responses, presents a fair approximation of
her acting limitations.  One of the reasons for the failure of the
basic premise in THE PELICAN BRIEF--that Darby could uncover the truth
while everyone else fumbles around--is that the lead actress does
nothing to make us believe the possibility.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, probably the biggest problem with THE PELICAN BRIEF is
that it's a letdown.  After all the running around (and there's a lot
of that), all the gory deaths (there are a few of them), and all the
anemic plot twists, the payoff is virtually nonexistent.  Instead of
the rousing conclusion expected from a screen thriller, THE PELICAN
BRIEF fades away into an anticlimax.</P>
<P>     Those who read the book have no need to see the movie, unless it's
to satisfy the curiosity of how the conjurations of the imagination
materialize through the filter of Pakula's interpretation.  Those who
haven't read the book will find material to catch their interest, but
it's uncertain how long this ill-paced production will hold that
attention.</P>
<P>     So, after the disappointments of THE FIRM and THE PELICAN BRIEF,
we now await the cinematic rendition of THE CLIENT, hoping that for
Grisham's books, the third time will be a charm.</P>
