<PRE>                                SPHERE
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     SPHERE, the latest Michael Crichton novel to be brought to the
screen, is a physical and psychological thriller that keeps you on the
edge of your seat.  Barry Levinson, the director of the excellent and
topical movie WAG THE DOG as well as his Academy Award winning RAIN
MAN, brings just the right blend of fast-paced action sequences and
slower mental exercises.  Using some of the same scientific deduction
techniques as last year's CONTACT, the movie involves your brains as
well as your emotions.</P>
<P>     Good film critics develop a sense of what is enough to tell their
readers about a movie to give them a feel for it without giving away
key plot twists.  (Today's studio trailers, on the other hand, feel
compelled to give away everything to audiences in a misguided fear that
they will not see the movie otherwise.)  SPHERE tests the abilities of
critics since several elements of the story that are best left
unmentioned are so central to the critique of the movie.  I will, as
always, try to strike the right balance and in the case of SPHERE
probably give away much less than other reviewers since it is the
delight of the surprise that makes this movie so interesting and
involving.</P>
<P>     As SPHERE opens, psychologist Norman Johnson, played perfectly
with humor and vulnerability by Dustin Hoffman, is on his way to a
plane crash in the middle of the ocean.  Or so he thinks.  It seems
that years ago, as a lark, he had written a pseudo-serious white paper
for the government on how to handle the discovery of an alien
spacecraft.  Now, they have discovered an alien craft deep down on the
ocean floor that is covered by so much coral that they know it landed
there almost 300 years ago.  Moreover, they have detected that there is
still a motor humming within the ship.</P>
<P>     Leading the crew that goes down to investigate is an
anal-retentive officer named Harold Barnes from one of the spy
agencies.  As the no-disasters-on-my-watch Harold, Peter Coyote gives a
stern eye to all of the scientists on board.  In a tense moment after
they establish communication with the HAL-like alien, Harold demands to
know his last name for the record.  Can't just put down that some alien
named Jerry is wreaking havoc on his crew.  Full names are mandatory in
such situations.</P>
<P>     Liev Schreiber plays Ted Fielding, the author of the Book of the
Month selection, "Astrophysics You Can Use."  He and fellow MIT
graduate Harry Adams trade barbs about who has the largest number of
doctorates and who got his Ph. D. first.  Harry, played with suitable
mysteriousness by Samuel L. Jackson, is the odd man out.  As all hell
breaks loose, he idles his time away sleeping, eating voraciously, and
reading Jules Verne's "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea."</P>
<P>     Looking like ALIEN's Ripley, a close cropped Sharon Stone plays
marine biologist Beth Halpern.  Beth has a history of mental
instability and once had an affair with Norman.  Continuing with her
recent movie tradition, Stone has no romantic scenes of any kind.  She
plays a tough cookie whose only goal is to be a survivor.</P>
<P>     The script interlaces just enough humor with the terror to keep
from exhausting the audience.  "Are you a religious man, Norman?" Harry
asks in a moment on the brink of total disaster.  "Atheist, but I'm
flexible," Norman replies with a nervous laughter.</P>
<P>     The best parts of the movie are not the scary parts, of which
several had me jumping in my seat, but the ones where they spend the
time to consider the scientific implications of what is happening.  At
one point, Harry uses a beautiful bit of scientific logic to deduce
their chances of survival.  In another, Jerry informs his new human
"friends" that he is happy.  This troubles Norman greatly.  He reasons
that an alien with emotions is a scary proposition since beings that
are happy can turn angry just as easily.</P>
<P>     With headings like chapters of a book the movie races to its
conclusion.  As the tension ratchets up, the film has trouble
sustaining its momentum.  By the last half hour, the picture begins to
bog down, and it ends in its hokiest scene of all.  (They got the
principals back together last month to film new scenes after the movie
had problems with its test screens.  I would love to know what the
changes were.  Please drop me a line if you know.)</P>
<P>     Even though they lose it somewhat in end, the film has so much
intelligence and energy than it is well worth seeing.  (There I did it.
I got through the whole review without even mentioning the sphere
itself, among many other things.  How many other reviewers will be able
to do that?)</P>
<P>     SPHERE runs a little too long at 2:12.  It is rated PG-13 for
sci-fi action and scary scenes and would be fine for kids around eleven
and up, depending upon how prone they are to nightmares.</P>
