<PRE>Mortal Kombat (1995)
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
(C) 1997 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: Just plain fun -- no more, no less. Check your brain, and don't
think futzing with a D-pad is going to change the storyline.</P>
<P>I didn't want to see this film. As enamored as I am of video-game culture, I
still went in with gritted teeth. "Okay," I snarled, making it sound like a
dare, "entertain me."</P>
<PRE>Dare accepted.</PRE>
<P>MK is as silly and ephemeral as any trendsploitation movie has ever been
(when do we get the MAGIC: THE GATHERING flick, for instance?), but it's one
of the best made -- certainly one of the best-looking -- and a ton of
lowbrow fun. I've got high standards for most movies, but I can still be a
pushover for a good, silly picture: high production values, yards of action,
nothing that would make the movie seem rancidly exploitive or cynical. MK
fits all three categories nicely.</P>
<P>Based somewhat loosely on the video game that made video games a bad juju
with parents all over again, MORTAL KOMBAT takes three heroes and pits them
against impossible odds -- evil magic, vicious martial-arts masters, demons
with four arms, and everything else the makeup and FX people could plaster
together or digitally synthesize. Do they win? Are movie-theater floor
sticky in summertime? Well... devil's in the details, y'know, so feel free
to read on.</P>
<P>Mortal Kombat, as we learn, is a cosmic karateka that takes place between
our world and some outlying dimension you don't want to get stuck in after
the last bar closes. The best of the best come to fight, and if "we"
(meaning Earth) wins, the world doesn't get overrun by evil for another
generation. Our three heroes, Liu Kang, Sonya and Johnny Cage, all come into
the contest with considerable trepidations and a little emotional baggage of
their own. Their nemesis is the cold-hearted Shang Tsung (played with tasty
nastiness by Cary Hiroyuki-Tagawa, who always gets roles like this), and
their mentor is the god of thunder, Raiden (also hammed up happily by none
other than Christopher Lambert, the best bad actor around).</P>
<P>The movie isn't a masterpiece of story or intellect -- but it does something
few movies of this type do well: it grabs you from the start and keeps you
solidly entertained all the way through. Almost every scene begins and ends
with a spectacularly choreographed fight, and the photography is stylish and
fast-moving. This is the kind of movie where you want to take home the
stills and hang them on your wall.</P>
<P>What else makes the movie work? A sly sense of self-referential humor, which
thankfully isn't overdone. (Watch, for instance, the way the battle between
Johnny Cage and Skorpion ends, and pay careful attention to the very last
shot. It's a howler.) Lambert has great fun as Raiden, and everyone involved
seems to be enjoying themselves. Which, when you think about it, isn't
something you can base on any one thing; it's everything.</P>
<P>I recently saw a movie with similar ambitions -- the uninvolving CRYING
FREEMAN -- and walked out disappointed. Why? Nobody seemed to be really
enjoying themselves. It all looked like one giant slog. MK may not be the
best movie ever made, but it's a gas, and few enough movies are good on just
that level.</P>
