<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A road film about trying to reach somewhere. This human interest drama
is one big metaphor about a strained father and daughter relationship.
They are trying to find themselves while on the road. The keen dynamics
between the down-and-out alcoholic father, Tomas (Stellan Skarsgard),
and his cocaine-snorting but successful lawyer daughter, Kaisa (Lena
Headey), gives this universal theme (father-daughter relationship) a
fresh look. This intense story about a dysfunctional family is powerful
but bleak, and is directed with a fierce honesty by Norwegian director
Hans Petter Moland ("Zero Kelvin"/"The Last Lieutenant").</P>
<P>Kaisa's mother (Rampling) is dying of cancer in a hospital in Aberdeen
and after not being close with her daughter for a number of years, calls
her in London and asks her to take her alcoholic father, living on a rig
in Oslo, to visit her. Kaisa is an ambitious lawyer who wears
high-powered business suits, is not afraid of having sex to help her
career, and is smart enough to know how to play office politics as good
as a man does. She has just received an office promotion and is having
sex with a stranger (the kind of relationship she prefers) when she
receives the unwelcome call from her mother. When her parents, who never
married, split-up, she went to live with her oil worker father in
Norway. She blames him for her now being so cold-hearted and scared to
face herself, telling him she lost her virginity as a kid while he was
away; and, that he never was a proper parent to her. What she has
learned best from him, is that you can't trust men.</P>
<P>Her drunk father is an unpleasant travelling companion. They can't get
on a flight because he's drunk, so they hop a ferry to Great Britain and
then try to make their way to Aberdeen by rental car. But she gets a
flat tire and there's no spare. To her rescue comes lorry driver Clive
(Ian Hart). He's attracted to her, but finds her relationship with her
dad to be" strange but nice." Dad likes him, telling her he's a nice guy
and wonders why she's not attracted to him. When dad is too drunk to
resume the journey and has to spend a night in jail, she sleeps with the
self-effacing Clive. He perceptively picks up what's her problem with
men, that she's afraid of a real relationship with someone she likes
because she's afraid of getting hurt. He, therefore, becomes their
guardian angel for the rest of the trip and offers them some common
sense advice. But he's in emotional depths beyond what he can imagine,
and feels he has become part of their nightmare when he has to rescue
the father from a mugging and stop the same rowdy thugs from pummeling
Kaisa.</P>
<P>It's a film that avoids cliches for its answers, has plenty of energy,
and an intelligent script to go along with the brilliant performances by
both Lena Headey and Stellan Skarsgard. My favorite line in the film is
when the self-pitying drunken father tries to explain himself by saying:
"I'm outdated. It is unfashionable to have a mind of your own."
"Aberdeen" is thematically similar to Mike Figgis's "Leaving Las Vegas,"
except there the end of the journey was most important, here it is the
journey itself that counts the most.</P>
