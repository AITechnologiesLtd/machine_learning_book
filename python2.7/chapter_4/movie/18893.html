<P>"I said he could stay. That doesn't make him my son."
With the voice talents of Tony Goldwyn, Wayne Knight, Brian Blessed,
Glenn Close, Alex D. Linz. Rated G.</P>
<P>Despite the recent success of pictures like Dreamworks' Antz, Disney
continues to reign as the king of animation. In recent years, it has
found a way to make "cartoons", as they are still affectionately called,
equally accessable to both children and adults. Works like Aladdin
entertained tykes with broader gags while keeping the often unwilling
parents glued to their seat with the razor-sharp wit that has since
become a trademark of Disney animation. The Lion King kept moviegoers of
all ages riveted with the unexpected power of its story (and I'm still
known to hum Hakuna Matata). So it comes as a disappointment that
Disney's latest production contains the least in years to interest
adults. Tarzan is one of the few features from the Mouse that fails to
transcend both age groups.</P>
<P>Loosely adapted from Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic tall-tale, Tarzan is
no longer a novelty, with nearly 50 films sporting some variation on the
legendary Ape Man. Even some of Tarzan's target audience has seen films
like George of the Jungle and have experience with the plot. And that
plot has nearly become a mimeograph, a template for filmmakers to
slightly tinker with and pass off as their own creation. Tarzan is
abandoned by his family in the jungle (due to the family's death),
discovered and raised by apes. Then Tarzan meets Jane, falls in love but
gets in trouble with his ape family as well as some of Jane's malevolent
companions.</P>
<P>With Tarzan, Disney has dared to release their first non-musical feature
in years, wisely keeping the songs being played in the background.
Unfortunately it is also the most non-memorable Disney feature. The
humor that punctuated films like The Lion King and Hercules is virtually
absent from this effort. Furthermore, Tarzan lacks interesting
characters, owing to the fact that Tarzan barely ever speaks. Visually,
this is one of the most impressive animated films to date, but as
Hollywood has discovered the hard way lately, visual flair is hard-
pressed to replace other, more important cinematic qualities. Still,
Tarzan seamlessly blends non-intrusive CGI images with the always
impressive handiwork to make a movie that is a sublimely effective piece
of eye-candy. And it tends to be more aesthetically pleasing to see an
animated Tarzan swinging gracefully through the vines then, say, a live
Johnny Weissmuller do it; he just doesn't have the knack for acrobatics
demonstrated by our animated friend. If nothing else, this new Tarzan is
gloriously devoid of campiness.</P>
<P>To its credit, this Tarzan has the guts to defy animation conventions.
Not only does it omit the redundant showtunes, but the hero doesn't have
a sidekick (what some might perceive as one isn't really a sidekick to
Tarzan; more like a good pal) and the villain has no henchman. It's
refreshing to see a different animated film, but unfortunately Tarzan
leaves out some of the good qualities along with the bad.</P>
<P>The film is voiced rather undistinctively by Tony Goldwyn as Tarzan,
Glenn Close as Tarzan's ape mother, Rosie O'Donnell as Tarzan's pal and
Lance Henricksen as the skeptical head of the ape family. The only
talent that stands out in Tarzan is that of the delightful Minnie Driver
as Jane; whose deliciouisly sarcastic and often hilarious delivery is
the only one that has a chance of appealing to the more sophisticated.</P>
<P>Family films need to be equally enjoyable to adults and wee ones alike,
thus the "family" moniker. But movies that can be equally alluring to
all age groups are exceedingly rare. Tarzan is superb childrens'
filmmaking, but adults might fare better skipping this surprisingly sub-
par endeavor.
