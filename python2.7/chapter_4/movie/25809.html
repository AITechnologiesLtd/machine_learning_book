<PRE>THE REPLACEMENTS</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>

<P>Just like back in 1987, the players of the professional football league 
(PFL?) are on strike. With only four games left in the season, and three 
wins needed to make the playoffs, the owner of the Washington Sentinels 
(Jack Warden) has decided to hire on replacement players to finish the 
season. They will be chosen and led by his old friend and former head coach, 
McGinty (Gene Hackman). McGinty decides to go with former college star Shane 
Falco (Keanu Reeves) as his QB, and a host of misfits as his starting 
players. His new players include: an ex-con; a SWAT team member; a sumo 
wrestler; two bodyguards named Jackson; a retired Welsh soccer player; a 
deaf man; and a janitor from a convenience store. Of course, the 
cheerleaders have also gone on strike (for some reason), and only their 
leader, Annabelle (Brooke Langton), remains. She decides to hire dancers as 
replacement cheerleaders, but the dancers neglect to mention that they are 
actually lap dancers. McGinty has to whip the players into shape and get 
them to win three of the next four games. Only two problems are facing him: 
one is that Falco has lost all his confidence since he lost the Sugar Bowl 
several years prior; and two is that the former players, led by QB Martel 
(Brett Cullen), are making things more than a little difficult for his 
players. Will McGinty and his team prevail? Will the sun rise tomorrow?</P>
<P>After reading that very generic sounding plot, these are probably a few of 
the questions running through your mind: Is "The Replacements" cliched? Is 
it formulaic? Is it coated by a nice, thick layer of cheese? And, most 
importantly, is it funny? The answers respectively are: yes, yes, yes, and 
oh god yes. In a summer thus far packed with humorless comedies ("Scary 
Movie", "Nutty Professor II"), Howard Deutch's ("The Odd Couple II") "The 
Replacements" is the only movie so far that had both the audience and me 
laughing so hard we couldn't breath. This is rather strange considering that 
the movie was released in August, that nesting ground for bad movies 
everywhere. One of the things that makes "The Replacements" such a rare 
comedy (particularly in this horrible year) is that it manages to keep the 
laughs coming nearly throughout its entire running time. In fact, the only 
times the laughs stop coming are when Keanu Reeves is alone on screen, with 
anyone, and the movie starts to get sappy and sentimental. Fortunately, 
Deutch never allows these moments to go on for too long, and you can always 
rest assured another hilarious scene is right around the corner.</P>
<P>In any screwball comedy like this, acting is not going to be all that 
important. Of course, in any movie with Gene Hackman, you're going to get 
some great acting regardless. Only Hackman could make some of the cheesy 
lines he gets sound great. For example, coming out of anyone else's mouth, a 
line like: "He doesn't have it all, he doesn't have heart. You do." would be 
ear-gratingly bad. Coming from Hackman, you don't even notice how cheesy it 
is. The problem is that standing next to Hackman you've got Keanu Reeves, 
the black hole of acting himself. Thankfully he does a decent enough job 
(for him anyway) and doesn't get in the way too often. The film's main 
strengths lie with the supporting cast. Granted, none of the supporting 
characters are developed in any way, but that really doesn't matter in a 
movie like this. You're not going to see a movie like "The Replacements" for 
deep, involved character development (at least I hope you're not). So if you 
put that aside and just have a good time, you should really get a kick out 
of some of these characters. The two that really stood out in my mind were 
Rhys Ifans' ("Notting Hill") Scottish kicker, Gruff; and John Favreau's 
("Swingers") completely insane SWAT team member, Daniel Bateman. Even if the 
rest of the movie were terrible, it would still be worthwhile just to see 
these two having a great time. John Madden and Pat Summerall show up playing 
two announcers named John Madden and Pat Summerall (hey, sometimes there are 
roles you are just born to play).</P>
<P>As much as I love both football and movies, it seems Hollywood is usually 
incapable of blending the two together. Let's think back here. The last 
attempted football movie was Oliver Stone's atrocious "Any Given Sunday", 
which managed to fail on every level. There was "Rudy", back in 1993, but 
while it succeeded as a dramatic film, it's hard to classify that one as a 
football movie. We've seen previous attempts at comical football movies with 
films like 1991's abysmal "Necessary Roughness" and Adam Sandler's somewhat 
amusing, though hardly hilarious "The Waterboy". What did these previous 
attempts lack that "The Replacements" contains? Simple enough, it contains 
not one, but several hilarious scenes which will stick in your mind for 
quite some time: A bar room brawl, the first training session, the two 
Jacksons talking to Martel about Falco's car, and a musical number in a 
prison cell which is just too funny to be described to name a few. If a 
movie can make that many of its scenes stick in your mind long after its 
viewing, then you know you got your money's worth.</P>
<P>The movie contains a few references only hardcore football fans would 
probably recognize. My favorite one was watching the pen happy John Madden 
be put to the test by one of Falco's bungled plays (if you're a football fan 
you know what I mean by that. If you're not a football fan, why are you 
thinking about seeing this movie?). The film's soundtrack isn't exactly the 
kind of music I care for, ranging from hard rock to oldies, but that doesn't 
mean it's inappropriate to the movie. I'd better warn all the parents out 
there (something I don't ordinarily do), while the film may carry a PG-13 
rating, the football violence can be a bit much, there's a significant 
amount of swearing, and the scenes involving the new cheerleaders can be a 
bit, um, much. "The Replacements" runs 118 minutes, though it doesn't feel 
anywhere near that long. I'd recommend it to fans of football movies and 
comedies. If you happen to be a fan of both, you should have a blast. I give 
the movie a well earned four out of five stars. By the way, the movie does 
leave us with a great moral. Pain heals, chicks dig scars, and glory lasts 
forever.</P>
