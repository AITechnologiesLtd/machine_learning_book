<P>     With all of the hoopla surrounding the re-release of GREASE, I 
decided this was a good opportunity to review one of my all-time 
favorite musicals.  After debating between HIGH SOCIETY and SINGING IN 
THE RAIN, I chose the former -- not necessarily because it's better, but 
because it isn't as well-known (that should not in any way be confused 
with "obscure," which this movie certainly isn't). </P>
<P>     HIGH SOCIETY is a remake of the popular 1940 romantic comedy THE 
PHILADELPHIA STORY, which starred Cary Grant as C.K. Dexter-Haven, 
Katharine Hepburn as Tracy Lord (a name later subtly changed and adopted 
by an infamous porn star), and James Stewart as Mike Connor.  The plot 
details and character names are the same for both versions, as are some 
of the lines of dialogue, but there is one critical difference:  HIGH 
SOCIETY supplants THE PHILADELPHIA STORY's excessive talkiness with nine 
top-notch musical numbers from Cole Porter.  I'm probably one of the few 
critics who prefers the remake to the original, but HIGH SOCIETY is 
better-paced, more energetic, and generally more enjoyable.  While it's 
true that some of the character interaction in this film isn't as 
pointed or witty, the musical component more than makes up for this 
deficiency.</P>
<P>     HIGH SOCIETY shifts the setting from Philadephia's Main Line to 
Newport, Rhode Island.  There, amidst the mansions of the filthy rich, 
we meet Tracy Lord (Grace Kelly), the quintessential ice goddess.  
Beautiful, haughty, and condescending, she ruthlessly discards men who 
don't live up to her expectations, including her philandering father 
(Sidney Blackmer) and her composer ex-husband, C.K. Dexter-Haven (Bing 
Crosby).  Now, she's about to embark upon a second marriage.  This time, 
her intended is the irreproachable and dull George Kittredge (John 
Lund).  On hand to cover the wedding are an ace gossip reporter, Mike 
Connor (Frank Sinatra), and his faithful sidekick, photographer Liz 
Imbrie (Celeste Holm).  But the pre-wedding preparations do not go 
smoothly.  Dexter still loves Tracy, and is determined to stop the 
ceremony.  To that end, he enlists the help of his friend, jazz great 
Louis Armstrong.  And things get further muddled when Mike and Tracy 
have a brief romantic fling.  </P>
<P>     There's a lot to like about HIGH SOCIETY.  The romantic elements, 
while heartfelt, aren't overplayed.  The film's dialogue, although 
lacking the full punch of that in THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, is still 
delightful.  (The best exchange is without a doubt the one between Tracy 
and Mike as they zip around Newport in her car, bantering about wealth, 
idleness, and class differences.)  However, the two chief pleasures of 
HIGH SOCIETY are the performances, which bring life and vitality to the 
characters, and the music, which makes this the kind of movie that never 
loses its appeal.</P>
<P>     Crosby, Sinatra, Kelly, and Armstrong are all given opportunities 
to sing, and they make the most out of them.  Sinatra and Crosby have a 
fine, lively duet called "Well, Did You Evah?" while Crosby and Kelly 
share the spotlight for the lightly romantic "True Love."  Armstrong 
gets the film off to a fine start with "High Society," a calypso song 
whose lyrics lay out the background of the story that is about to 
unfold.  The musical highlight is without a doubt the Armstrong/Crosby 
duet "Now You Has Jazz," a lively tune guaranteed to get the feet 
tapping.  Unlike many musicals of the '50s, HIGH SOCIETY does not rely 
on grand production numbers or carefully-choreographed song-and-dance 
numbers.  Director Charles Walters keeps everything intentionally low-
key.  But, because the tunes are so well-written and the singers are so 
adept, there's no sense that anything is lacking.</P>
<P>     While Bing Crosby isn't as good a Dexter as Cary Grant, the 
actor/singer still manages to develop a likable and sympathetic 
character who the audience instinctively roots for.  We want him to tame 
the shrew, to knock the goddess off her pedestal.  As Mike, Frank 
Sinatra brings a little more ruggedness to the role than Jimmy Stewart, 
who took home a Best Supporting Actor statuette for his efforts.  Not 
surprisingly, the real scene-stealer is the luminous Grace Kelly, in her 
last film role (the engagement ring Tracy wears in HIGH SOCIETY is 
actually the engagement ring given to the actress by Prince Ranier).  
Kelly, whose Hollywood career was short-but-spectacular, shows here why 
she so dazzled and captivated the world.  Kelly's interpretation of 
Tracy doesn't eclipse Hepburn's (for whom the role was originally 
written), but she nonetheless stakes her claim on the part.  </P>
<P>     HIGH SOCIETY is truly one of the great MGM musicals, and, watching 
it again reminded me how gimmicky and one-dimensional something like 
GREASE is.  Sure, the Travolta/Newton-John tribute to the '50s has 
pizzazz and enjoyable music, but the characters and situations are much 
less interesting that those found in SINGING IN THE RAIN or HIGH 
SOCIETY.  The 1950s musicals are full entertainment packages, not 
shallow attempts to sell soundtracks.  HIGH SOCIETY doesn't just have a 
voice -- it has a heart and a soul as well.</P>
