<PRE>Armageddon
A Review by Fred M. Hung</PRE>
<P>In an era bereft of such mythical heroes as Sir Arthur's Knights of the
Round Table, Hollywood attempts to fill the void with tales of ordinary
men thrust into extraordinary circumstances. The pragmatic 90s have all
but eliminated the magic of kings and queens.  Thus instead of Lancelot
and Knights, we have … Harry Stamper and oil drillers?  </P>
<P>Armageddon is the latest product from Jerry Bruckheimer who brought us
The Rock, Crimson Tide, Con Air, and Top Gun to name a few.  This time
he is again teamed with Michael Bay, director of The Rock, to bring the
story of a fierce "Global-killer" asteroid on a direct trajectory with
Earth.  Since comparisons to this season's earlier film about asteroids
is inevitable, the simplest way to describe this one would be Deep
Impact on steroids.  </P>
<P>Much of the Bruckheimer trademarks are present, helicopters in
formation, FBI agents in their dark suits, dark jackets, and dark
suburbans, crisp military salutes, motorcades of government vehicles
from the horizon, and stalwart men marching in unison into their finest
hour.  Themes of honor and duty are well represented.  All protagonists
unequivocally volunteer for missions of no return.  American garrison
flags can be seen on rustic homes from small town Kansas to large
hangars in NASA.  Optimists will call Armageddon patriotic, detractors
will call it propaganda.  Whatever the case, none can deny that the film
visually spectacular.  Bay, a former rock video director, is a genius at
creating incredibly slick imagery.  From shepherds in Scotland, to
Muslims in India, parts of Armageddon will rival AT&T and American
Express commercials.  Combine all these elements with an adrenaline
pulsating soundtrack by Aerosmith and others, Bruckheimer has again
brought us the testosterone flick of the year.</P>
<P>Despite the sheen and marketing blitz, Armageddon can not compensate for
its overriding weakness, unidimensional characters.  Bruckheimer and Bay
entertainingly introduce us to men who are mankind's saviors, but never
bother to tell us who they really are.  Bruce Willis, the leader of the
motley crew, never transcends the terse and grimacing tough guy.  Ben
Affleck and Liv Tyler are the star-crossed lovers.  Billy Bob Thorton is
a Sen. Fred Thompson clone.  Will Patton is the loyal sidekick.  Steve
Buscemi again reprises his stereotype as the Shakespearean clown but
this time in space.  Although Armageddon proceeds at a breakneck pace,
the script accords so little for character development.  Consequently,
it is difficult to sympathize, or empathize for that matter, with the
characters' fates.  </P>
<P>No unwritten law exists that states testosterone action and character
development are mutually exclusive.  In fact it was also Bruckheimer and
Bay who gave us Ed Harris' complex and tortured anti-villain in the
Rock.  It is Armageddon's ambitious scope, so many characters, so many
events, that prevented such exposition.  Moments of emotion are too
easily eclipsed by explosions.  </P>
<P>That being said, the film is by no means a failure.  While certainly
transparent and mindless, Armageddon had me saluting cab drivers as I
exited the film.  Personal bias – I live for images of flags waving in
the wind, salutes, self-sacrificing men, and  F-16s flying missing man
formations.  Bruckheimer and Bay are no Chaucer and Homer, nor do they
pretend to be.  Armageddon is simply meant to rally an audience, for 2.5
hours, to surrender belief and cheer for 8 men who are willing to
sacrifice themselves for a greater good.  This isn't poetry, but it's
still a lot of fun.</P>
