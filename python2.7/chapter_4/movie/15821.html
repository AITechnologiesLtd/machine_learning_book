<PRE>Grade: 84</PRE>
<P>"The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari", a silent film from
Germany, may be the best feature made prior to 1920.
Certainly it is better than the over-ripe "Birth of
a Nation", and nearly as influential.  Perhaps the
first great horror film, "Caligari" is also a
psychodrama, turning the tables on the audience by
changing its perspective.</P>
<P>Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) has a booth at a
county fair, where he promotes his sleepwalking
zombie Cesare (Conrad Veidt, better known for his
role in "Casablanca" two decades later).  Patrons
at the fair include protagonist Francis (Friedrich Feher)
and his friend Alan (Hans Heinz von Twardowski), who
are rivals for the love of Jane (Lil Dagover).</P>
<P>Cesare, under the direction of Caligari, murders
Alan and tries to kidnap Jane.  Francis suspects Caligari,
and after some difficulty convinces the authorities.
But in a wild plot twist, Francis, Cesare, and Jane
are all inmates in a lunatic asylum run by the
benevolent Dr. Caligari.</P>
<P>"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is a very impressionistic
film.  The sets appear to be painted cardboard, but
they give a psychedelic effect.  With its zombies,
mad scientists and lunatics, the film was both
unsettling and inspirational, with its ingredients
used in any number of Universal horror pictures
from the 1920s and 1930s.</P>
<P>Perhaps too much has been read into the film over the
years.  The subplot of a zombie controlled by an evil
man has been called an allegory of World War I,
while the revelation of Francis as a lunatic has been
called the result of censorship, to prevent the
repudiation of authority.  But perhaps the film should
be taken at face value: as an innovative and important
horror film, and not as social commentary about troubled
postwar Germany.</P>
