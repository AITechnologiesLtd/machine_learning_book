<PRE>_Caligula_ no stars (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Since its initial release in 1979, no film quite like _Caligula_ has
ever been made--and with good reason; it is widely known to be one of the
worst films ever made, and anyone who's seen it would be hard-pressed to
argue with that assessment.  But as with a lot of bad would-be art, this
cinematic oddity holds a truly bizarre fascination, especially in this
fully restored, 20th anniversary edition, which is slowly making its way
around to big screens around the country.</P>
<P>On the big screen is the only way one can, ahem, "appreciate" this
gaudy, flat-out bizarre exercise in cinematic fragmentation.  Whatever
chance this film had of turning out well was done in by the participants'
conflicting intentions, which can be broken down into three perspectives.
 From one, there are original screenwriter (the adapter remains
uncredited) Gore Vidal and the Serious British Actors (including no less
than Sir John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole), who obviously believed they
were making a serious exposé of the decadence of the Roman empire, namely
the reign of the megalomaniacal title character (Malcolm McDowell).  Then
there's original director Tinto Brass, whose insistence on filling every
last shot of film with some artfully-lit nudity comes straight from the
school of mainstream exploitation cinema.  Last--and certainly not
least--comes (in _every_ sense of the word) producer and _Penthouse_
publisher Bob Guccione, who wrested control of the film from Brass and
then shot and edited in some balls-out (literally) hardcore pornography.</P>
<P>The finished product, as one can glean, is one giant mess.  Any given
scene can shift from McDowell's overacting to nonchalant glimpses of full
frontal men and women to explicit closeups of sexual penetration.  It
makes for a jarring watch--but certainly never a boring one.  In fact,
it's this identity crisis that lends the film its biggest virtue:
unintentional comedy.  As disgusting as it is for most audience, how can
one _not_ laugh at the film's centerpiece cum shot, which has to be the
first and only in screen history that has been scored to a full-blown
orchestral crescendo and climax?</P>
<P>These "additional scenes directed and photographed" by Guccione and
Giancarlo Lui come out of nowhere and have only tangential connection to
the story--no surprise since the main actors were called on to do just
that, and only anonymous extras get down and dirty.  For example, the
film's famous girl-on-girl scene is sloppily intercut with a rather tame
threesome between Caligula, his wife Caesonia (Helen Mirren, whose role
consists of standing around in various states of undress, spouting very
little dialogue), and beloved sister Drusilla (Teresa Ann Savoy).  The
tiny plot "thread" that connects them is that the two women ("played" by
_Penthouse_ pets Anneka DiLorenzo and Lori Wagner) spy on the three from
a secret room, get hot, and get it on; eventually, their activities win
more screen time than those of the three bonafide characters.  I must
admit that the lesbian encounter is the only hardcore interlude that can
be considered remotely erotic, but that doesn't make its inclusion any
more ludicrous, especially in light of the fact that the secret room,
which is shown in an earlier scene as being dark and empty, features a
big, fully made bed and is lit with a seductive red light.</P>
<P>But it's not as if there's a whole lot of plot to begin with, anyway. 
The apparent point of the film is to show that Caligula was--to put it
bluntly--one sick motherfucker.  He was hungry for power; he indulged in
sexual excess; he exacted violent action upon his enemies.  It's a point
that comes clear within a half hour at most.  But _Caligula_ drives home
that point over and over again until, after two-and-a-half-hours,
Caligula's reign meets a suitably bloody end.  Before that point,
however, we see Caligula's sadism in graphic detail; in one especially
notorious scene, Caligula's guards cut off a man's penis--in tight
closeup--then feed it to dogs.  We also see everything--and I mean
everything--that goes down (literally) at the many orgies Caligula
stages.  And then there's Caligula himself.  To McDowell's credit, he
threw all inhibitions out the window and spared no risk in taking this
role.  But then there's the matter of the risks he's made to take: he
prances around in a skimpy toga; he wildly dances in the rain completely
nude; he vomits in slow-motion; he rapes the bride at a wedding
reception, then fists the groom; he licks a dead female body up and down;
he even gets to sleep with a horse.  That McDowell performs these tasks
with such deranged gusto actually helps--what would otherwise be
stomach-turning and offensive is rendered ridiculously laughable.</P>
<P>Which is what _Caligula_ is behind all the violence, sex, and various
bodily fluids: an idea so preposterously bad as to be hilarious
(big-budget pornographic historical epic?).  The rerelease poster boasts,
"Just as shocking twenty years later."  Indeed it is, but not in the way
intended.  Moreso than, say, the sight of a group of guys ejaculating
into a bowl (yes, that's in there), what is truly shocking is that
_Caligula_ ever got made.</P>
