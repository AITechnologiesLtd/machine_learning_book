<PRE>When We Were Kings (1997)
* * * *
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1998 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: A perfect evocation of a defining moment in time for two men and
two nations.</P>
<P>I was just old enough to remember the adoration and respect that Muhammad
Ali commanded -- not just from blacks, but from everyone. He was an artist,
and boxing was his medium. He *was* The Greatest: he embodied his ambitions
perfectly. He had come out of exile, as it were, to fight a fresh young
contender (George Foreman), and he won.</P>
<P>WHEN WE WERE KINGS is a documentary -- one of the best ever made, quite
frankly -- that takes that moment in time, the "Rumble in the Jungle", and
makes it feel like it's happening to us now.</P>
<P>Most of the footage in WHEN WE WERE KINGS had been stranded in limbo for
decades, the victim of an ugly legal entanglement. Having it brought back to
the light of day is important, because there are so many people today --
black, white, young, old -- who either don't remember Ali's impact, or have
forgotten. The movie's power is in that it takes mere images of Ali and the
men who remembered him and were near him at the time and makes them feel as
though they are entering the room with us. In a curious way, this movie may
actually work better on TV than in a theater, because of the intimacy
factor.</P>
<P>The one thing that the movie makes clear, almost without trying: Ali
commanded respect just by being there. Even his speech had the rhythm of his
body and his movements: "I fought a rock. I punished a brick. I'm so bad I
make medicine sick!" In print, the words lose their life; hearing them come
out of his mouth, you understand how so many found him charismatic --
especially the Africans in Zaire, who saw in him a brother in arms.</P>
<P>George Foreman, on the other hand, couldn't have been more of an opposite.
When George Foreman arrived in Zaire, he was seen as an outsider in many
ways: he brought his dogs with him, which reminded the people of the
brutality under colonial rule. (Even more shocking: few in Africa knew he
was black until he arrived.) Foreman was a punishingly brutal fighter: when
he finished with a punching bag, there was a dent in it that could have held
water. (One rather cruelly apt joke, courtesy of Richard Pryor, summed up
his approach: "Foreman's got the most unique boxing style... None. The bell
ring, and he come out -- 'Which one the referee? 'Cos I 'mo *kill* the other
motherf___er.'")</P>
<P>In private, Ali sensed that others were certain he could not win -- he was,
after all, 33, while Foreman was young and fresh. But he was in it for the
challenge, not for the winning -- while Foreman approached the whole thing
as a fait accompli. The more you see of the two of them, the starker the
contrast: Ali was privately reflective and publicly brash; Foreman was
nearly subverbal everywhere.</P>
<P>The fight itself takes up very little of the movie's running time, and
that's an intelligent decision, because we instead get the context we need
to understand what happened. Foreman used up so much of his energy in trying
to punish Ali into instant submission, that Ali was able to unleash his
energy in reserve and KO Foreman almost at once. A frightening theory, but
everything we see supports it.</P>
<P>The most wonderful thing about the movie is how it makes everything it
discusses seem immediate and real. Documentaries tend to deal with the past
as a closed chapter, over and done. This one approaches a story of legendary
proportions like it's news. I can't think of a better way to do it.</P>
