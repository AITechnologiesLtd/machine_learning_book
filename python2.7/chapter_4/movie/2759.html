<PRE>                                   NORTH
                       A film review by John Walker
                        Copyright 1994 John Walker</PRE>
<P>     My form of "rating": NORTH kept me chuckling throughout, with a
     suitable number of guffaws, and a continual presence of neat
     things to grin at or think about.  I just got the sound track and
     book; now how do I get the tee-shirt and baseball cap?!</P>
<PRE>In brief: It's *fun*!</PRE>
<P>     NORTH is practically an archetype, a fable, a myth, of an
     important set of experiences in growing up--when you realize
     that your parents aren't perfect, and that other families and
     cultures are sort of strange, and so are you!</P>
<P>     Based on the 1984 kid's book of the same name by Alan Zweibel, the
     film takes an unabashedly kid's-eye view of the world.  If you
     want a traditional category to describe NORTH, it's
     "whimsy"--utterly fantastic things presented as if they were
     completely ordinary.</P>
<P>     My suspicion is that responses to NORTH will depend on how well
     people can cope with a whimsical and kiddish perspective, *and*
     on how they have dealt with the experiences on which the film is
     based.</P>
<P>     (Why anyone would *not* find NORTH *at least* a pleasant
     diversion is beyond me.  I suppose I can "understand" how someone
     might have a negative reaction, but it's something I can't
     "experience".  When those negative reactions are extreme, I begin
     to wonder whether something else is afoot--something more than
     merely a bizarre response to a funny, well-made flick.)</P>
<PRE>                            <<The story>></PRE>
<P>     At eleven years old, North (Elijah Wood) is The Perfect Kid.
Bright, athletic, the works.  He is popular with the other kids even
while their parents hold him up as a rebuke to any failing.  ("*North*
*flosses*.")  But his own parents (Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Jason
Alexander) are so wrapped up in themselves and their jobs, they don't
even seem to *notice* him, much less appreciate him.  His schoolwork is
suffering, his Little League performance, everything.  He fails at
trying to break through their self-absorption.  He's got to do
something.</P>
<P>     Prompted by an idea that comes up during a conversation with a
department-store Easter Bunny (Bruce Willis, who also narrates), North
begins thinking of becoming a free agent.  In short order, his friend
Winchell (Mathew McCurley), editor of the school paper, has put him
together with Arthur Belt (Jon Lovitz), a shyster lawyer.  North sues!
He wins!  But Judge Buckle (Alan Arkin) rules that he has to be in the
arms of his new (or old) parents by noon on Labor Day, or it's The
Orphanage for him.</P>
<P>     It's July.  Now, he has to sort through all the candidate parents
who are flooding him with first-class tickets to come to them.</P>
<P>     While he globe trots, Winchell is making his move.  Parents are
hysterical with fear.  If North can do it, why not *their* kids?
Winchell is building a movement out of this--out of the parents'
fears, and out of the kids' dawning sense of power.  (Will the voting
age be lowered to seven?!)</P>
<P>     So, we get to see prospective parents from Texas, Hawaii, Alaska,
China, Africa, France, and others back in the States.</P>
<P>     I don't think it's any spoiler to say that North will have to deal
with less than ideal candidates.  Even when they *look* ideal, there'll
be personal problems, personal quirks, and cultural differences, just
for starters.  Parallel to that are the implications of North the real
kid becoming a Symbol--not a *player* in the Game of Power, but a
*prize*, a *precondition*.</P>
<P>     Well, how will it end?  What are the candidate parents really
like?  Who among them will be the lucky winners?  How will North factor
in to Winchell's growing power and lust for world domination?</P>
<PRE>     Hey, it'd be a spoiler to answer any of those questions!</PRE>
<PRE>                         <<The acting, etc.>></PRE>
<P>     In NORTH, Wood plays perhaps the only character who might be
"real."  He has to deal with a wacko universe, and still respond,
believably, in a relatively sane way.  Wood's essential reality gives a
center of gravity to the whole film--in the context of everyone else's
lunacy.</P>
<P>     Everyone else is either a kid's perspective of what adults are
"really" like--or what many (whether kid or adult) would really *like*
to be if they had the chance.  McCurley's Winchell is, well, a sleaze.
A creep with a certain kind of charm and intelligence, Winchell is
sneaky, underhanded, treacherous, power hungry, devious, and dangerous,
perhaps even a genuine fiend--in other words, I enjoyed McCurley's
performance immensely.</P>
<P>     Lovitz's attorney Belt is a lot like Winchell--except without
things like intelligence and "charm".  Therefore he's less dangerous.
He's a perfect grown up to be used as a pawn by Winchell.</P>
<P>     Willis, besides narrating, shows up on the scene in a number of
guises--such as ranch hand, beach bum, stand-up comic.  He has a nice,
easy-going, off-handed detachment.  Removed from everything, he mainly
gives North the opportunity to say what's on his mind and to bring his
choices out into the open where he can think about them.</P>
<P>     Besides those characters, there is an army of cameos.  I'll
mention some (not all!) names later, but if the names aren't always
familiar, the faces are.</P>
<P>     Also, as a bonus for adults, there are lots of nifty little points
integrated into the film.  For instance, for independent research:
Where have we seen the house in Texas?  What product placement is
incredibly blatant--and yet true and to the point!</P>
<PRE>                    <<Are you ready for whimsy?>></PRE>
<P>     From the opening credits, there's a sense that NORTH is *not*
gonna be giving us an "ordinary" picture of reality.  As the credits
roll, the camera takes us around what is apparently North's room.  But
it looks like a department-store window display of the perfect
room--packed with toys, trains, and what-not, in an impossibly tidy
arrangement that no one could really walk through without disturbing
something.</P>
<P>     The room doesn't figure in the story, but if it's any consolation,
its surreality is relatively realistic compared to the rest of the
film.  What NORTH gives us will be painted with a very broad brush.
Remember, it's based on a kid's book, a very whimsical one.  (Think
about the names of most the characters for a while.)  And the original
author, Zweibel, joined with Andrew Scheinman in writing the
screenplay, and was co-producer, along with director Rob Reiner.</P>
<P>     I just picked up a copy of the book, and while I haven't had time
to more than glance at it, both book and movie seem to give us similar
ideas.</P>
<PRE>     Well, what *are* those ideas?</PRE>
<P>     I'm sort of surprised that I haven't seen more comments about
cultural stereotypes in NORTH.  North's parents fall into a "suburban
Jewish" role; Ma and Pa Tex (Reba McIntire and Dan Ackroyd) are into
*Big*ness; the Alaskans (Kathy Bates, Graham Green, and grandpa, Abe
Vigoda) live in an electric-operated *igloo*!  (And in summer, the day
is six months long!)</P>
<P>     But more to the point is the personal baggage that at least *some*
of the parents carry.  Without, I hope, doing spoilers, we get a clear
drawing of things lots of kids have to live with in their parents:
North's own parents are wrapped up in their work, some of the
candidates act from insecurities, or want to lay a trip on their
Perfect Kid.  Others are just from different planets, culturally.</P>
<PRE>     Does any of this sound familiar?  Weird customs?  Screwed-up
grown-ups?</PRE>
<P>     Well, I can't speak for anyone else, but it certainly sounds
familiar to *me*.</P>
<P>     Maybe the burbs insulate some people from cultural differences,
but that wasn't the case in small-town Rhode Island, with lots of
nationalities clearly visible.  And in my own family, we had Scotch
Calvinists and Southern-Irish Protestants as well as Catholics to deal
with.</P>
<P>     Yeah, other nationalities do things that are weird, don't they?
But don't *we* look a bit weird to them, too?  And doesn't the same
thing happen with people in different classes?  I can remember my
parents discussing or explaining to me how they dealt with people from
different worlds.</P>
<P>     So, also, I came to realize that those around me, including my
parents, were a bit messed up--quite independent of class or culture.
Fears, limitations, quirks, they were all there.  And if I mentioned
them, my parents' response was sort of "Well, of course!" That's just
part of life, isn't it?  Isn't *everyone* a little messed up?  And
sometime or another, I came to see that even *I* was part of that!</P>
<P>     NORTH gives us all those ways in which we're different, and weird,
and messed up--writ large and presented as fun.</P>
<PRE>     And that, I think, is how someone could hate NORTH.</PRE>
<PRE>                 <<Can it be both bleak and funny?>></PRE>
<P>     On one level, NORTH gives us a world that is plainly ridiculous.
Its connection with "reality" is downright adversarial.  (I mean, if
NORTH is any indication, then there have been some *major* changes in
the situation in China since I last saw the news on the tube!)</P>
<P>     The rampant whimsy alone will be enough to bother some people.
But underneath the whimsy, is a view of life that can be seen as
radically dark, as unspeakably bleak.  It takes no effort to see that
NORTH recognizes serious questions of social order, death, and
alienation.  Also, think of the things we wanted as kids--and want as
grown-ups: attention, wealth, influence, a wonderful place to live.
North finds that they can come with a high emotional price tag.</P>
<P>     And in facing some really nice people, North has to admit that his
*own* limitations prevent him from accepting them as his parents.</P>
<PRE>           You seem like *very* nice folks, but to be totally honest
       with you, if I lived here, I sure wouldn't get much homework
       done.</PRE>
<P>     On one level, the message is stark: You're *alone*.  If you can
understand adults, you won't be able to rely on them.  And if you can
rely on them, you won't be able to understand them.  In the rare case
where you can both understand and rely on them, they'll still be alien
somehow.  And whether or not they're messed up, you've certainly got
problems yourself.</P>
<P>     Cheerful little message for kids, isn't it?  Yet it describes
facts of life we all have to deal with.  So what are we supposed to do
with that?</P>
<PRE>                     <<A generational analysis>></PRE>
<PRE>     Do you believe in the generations thing?</PRE>
<P>     Think of how the stereotypical Silent Generation, Boomer, and
X/Thirteener "ought" to respond when they find out that their parents
and other grown ups are messed up and there's lots of weird customs in
the world.</P>
<P>     The Silent Generation would try be Responsible Social Units, and
work to make everything tidy.  Or at least work to keep busy and make
money.</P>
<P>     Boomers would denounce all "stereotypes" as vicious lies and deny
the facts.  Alternatively, they'd go either blaming or self-condemning
or both; then they'd do therapy about it.</P>
<P>     Xers would whine about it and say it showed how rotten everything
was and showed why *their* lives were "dysfunctional"--a word the
Silents and Boomers gave them.</P>
<P>     True, those descriptions are strictly cartoons and cardboard.  But
they all agree that the weirdness and the dysfunctions are *very* big
deals indeed, and must be treated as such.</P>
<P>     Supposedly, however, there's a *fourth* generational type--the
same type as World War II's GI generation--the generation that got
dropped through a meat grinder.  The ones who survived came out to
produce the prosperity the the Silents matured in and Boomers grew up
in.  This is the generational type that will allegedly characterize
kids of Elijah Wood's age.  How would the cardboard GI generation
respond?</P>
<P>     I suggest they'd say, golly, that's too bad!  But ya can't let
little stuff like that get ya down!  C'mon!  We got a movie t'make!
(Break into big musical number of the sort they grew up on.)</P>
<P>     Less cardboardly and cartoonishly, they'd agree to the facts but
not do any big angst trip on them.  They'd try to deal with the
dysfunctions.  They'd probably *like* a lot of the simple weirdness,
and make movies that skewered every group possible.</P>
<PRE>                      <<So which way do we go?>></PRE>
<P>     Stereotypes aside, of the four responses, which seems to make the
most sense?  And which does NORTH come closest to?  And how do you
think some people are going to deal with NORTH when they really come
from a different planet?</P>
<P>     Let's face it, NORTH might well be patently offensive to some
people for the very reasons others find it entertaining.  How did *you*
deal with waking up to the facts that *everyone* is messed up to some
extent?  If someone else's dysfunction was really major, was that cause
for self-doubt?  Or cause to feel sorrow for the person?</P>
<P>     And how did you deal with recognizing that some folks are just
*different*?  Was it a big deal?  Or was it just life?  Was it maybe
even sort of neat?</P>
<P>     I think I know how North the kid would answer those questions.
And I'm afraid I suspect how some of the critics of NORTH the movie
would answer them.</P>
<PRE>     And I think I know how I'd answer the critics:</PRE>
<PRE>     VIVA EL NORTE!  VIVA EL NORTE!  VIVA EL NORTE!</PRE>
