<P>I looked back this week, at some of the reviews that I've written lately, and
I noticed a theme.  I had something bad to say about most of them (save
Return To Paradise), and it caused me think. Am I really to hard and critical
on movies, have I become that embittered old grown up that I always dreaded
when I was younger, or are the movies really just not that good.  Were my
expectations set too high?  All of these thoughts were rattling around in my
head as I entered the theater to see Simon Birch.  Let me just say that my
faith has once again been restored in the cinema, and its power.  Restored,
by a movie about pure, honest, true and real faith in the human spirit, and
the power of belief. Restored by a story about a boy who personifies faith in
its purest, most real and true form.</P>
<P>I really don't want to waste too much time analyzing this movie, because my
words really can't do justice to the effect and power this movie possesses.
Plain and simple, it is an emotional ride.  It is funny, heartwarming,
touching, inspirational, dramatic, smart, and real.  It contains all those
aspects, and yet does not become bogged down in any one of them to point of
overkill.  The movie knows the perfect recipe, and just how much of each to
throw in and make you feel it.</P>
<P>The story is simple and fairly secondary here. It is based upon a story
called "A Prayer For Owen Meany". A smaller than average boy faces the trials
and tribulations of life, with his one true friend, and an undying faith in
the fact that "God has a plan for him".  So strong is his faith, that his
maturity level and manner of speaking reach well beyond his 12 years.  The
characters are the real stars here, and each is pulled of flawlessly, down to
the smallest (no pun intended) role.  I always respect a movie so good, that
it can draw everyone together, and bring out the best in even the smallest of
roles.        Jan Hooks, as a put upon chain-smoking Sunday school teacher (a
Saturday Night alumnus who shows some promise in a sarcastically comic turn),
David Strathairn as the local minister, seemingly with a heart of gold, but a
deeper agenda (I've liked a lot of his work, he is an underrated, and
underused character actor), Ashley Judd, who I've liked since Time To Kill
(and not just because of her looks, but because of the sweet, yet sensual
power that she brings to every role) and even Oliver Platt, who I've taken to
task in a few roles (why Dr Dolittle..oh why Ollie), but here, he tones down
his manic comic talents, and comes across, and sweet, charming, even a bit
eccentric, but with a very big and caring heart.  However, the stars of this
movie, are the younger talents, Mazzello, and newcomer Smith.  Mazzello
(wonderful in "The Cure" and recognizable from Lost World) adds a powerful
dramatic touch to his youthful innocence, and ascent into puberty.  He is
like a million other kids you see in the summer, riding bikes, fishing,
swimming and playing baseball, ignorant to the world outside their own, and
committed to those closest to him.  I hope he takes on other roles, and grows
into his wonderful potential.  That brings me to Smith.  I am not sure what
exactly his background, and medical condition is (I cant remember, but I know
it's something), but he fits this role, as if he lives it, everyday.  You
feel like you are watching a camera on his life, because he does things, and
reacts, so naturally, and honestly, that if he's acting, it's one of the best
performances in years.</P>
<P>I never thought I would hear myself uttering the phrases "best movies" and
"Jim Carrey" in the same sentence. But alas, I must. Although Carrey doesn't
play a major part in this movie (narrating, and basically opening, and
closing the story), he is still showing me that maybe he is trying to take
the Robin Williams turn, and be taken seriously as an actor. His narration is
crisp, and effective, and his onscreen moments are emotional, seemingly
honest, and heartfelt.</P>
<P>Faith, and fate. The two words look similar, and are sometimes, as believed
by Simon, linked. But, as this movie so eloquently portrays, most have a hard
time believing in one, if not both. The prospect of them being linked
together is simply preposterous in the minds of these Doubting Thomases. The
strength of faith, whether it is in religion, or yourself, is an inner
quality that only some of us can grasp. A strong powerful knowledge that,
although you cannot see it, is there, wrapping you in it's loving arms, and
carrying you. Carrying you on a predestined journey, the plan that the
strength of your faith has built. The requirements to continue this journey
are simple. Just believe. Sounds very simple, but for those who need to see,
hold and touch, it can be very difficult. Simon Birch believed, and he tries,
in the best way he knows how, to make others feel his faith and believe his
fate. Whether he succeeds, or fails, depends upon the person, because Simon
knows, and believes, if you choose to as well, you can indeed do anything, no
matter the obstacle. See this as soon as possible, it will give you hope,
strength, faith, inspiration, a smile, and make you leave the theater a
different, maybe even stronger person, for having met Simon. Thank you.
