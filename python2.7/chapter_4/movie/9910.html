<PRE>Con Air</PRE>
<PRE>Chad'z rating: *** (out of 4 = good)</PRE>
<P>1997, R, 115 minutes [1 hour, 45 minutes]</P>
<PRE>[action]</PRE>
<P>starring: Nicholas Cage (Cameron Poe), John Cusack (U.S. Marshal Vince
Larkin), John Malkovich (Cyrus "The Virus" Grissom), Ving Rhames (Nathan
"Diamond Dog" Jones); written by Scott Rosenberg; produced by Jerry
Bruckheimer; directed by Simon West.</P>
<P>Seen Friday, November 21, 1997 at 8 p.m. at the SUNY Morrisville STUAC Little
Theater (Morrisville, N.Y.) for $2, by myself. [Theater rating: **1/2: small
screen, worn film, good seats, average sound]</P>
<P>I think there's only one way to make an action film successful, and that is
to not present the story as something to take seriously and to incorporate a
sense of satire. In its most basic form, "Con Air" is just as mindless and
over-the-top as every other action blockbuster, but it follows this rule
perfectly and thus it works.</P>
<P>The film opens with a painfully generic scene we've seen countless times
before. The main character, Cameron Poe (Cage), a military officer, returns
to his Southern home to visit his pregnant wife, but gets into a bar-room
brawl that ends up sending him to prison. Although this might not be the best
way to set up the story, it's forgivable because it only lasts about 10
minutes. This is minimal storytelling, but at least it's not disguised
storytelling.</P>
<P>After seven years, Poe is released and sent home on a routine prisoner
transfer flight, but considering the movie's title, there isn't anything
"routine" here. And so, after the plane takes off all Hell breaks loose and
the prisoners, as lead by the vile Cyrus "The Virus" Grissom (Malkovich), and
Nathan "Diamond Dog" Jones (Rhames), manage to break free of their shackles
and over-power the guards through some violent, but surprisingly believable,
means. </P>
<P>What's original is the fact the prisoners are quite clever and often funny.
They're not easy-to-hate villains as they have individual personalities. We
do get some one-liners here and there, but the things they say are pretty
funny. Also, they don't just blow away the guards and fly to freedom, they
have an intricate, detailed plan that doesn't require jargon and rhetoric to
be explained.</P>
<P>Once the film really gets in gear, it develops a tense atmosphere. Poe is a
likable character and we're hoping he'll return home safely, but the way
things go it doesn't seem like this will happen. The  scenario gives the film
a unique twist as we're almost hoping the prisoners will outsmart the
authorities, because if they don't, Poe will be shot down with the rest of
them.</P>
<P>Of course, in a movie like this there has to be the
other-hero-who-no-one-believes-has-figured-out-what's-really-going-on-until-it
's-too-late, and that character is U.S. Marshal Vince Larkin (Cusack).
Through a very uncanny method, Poe manages to get a message to Larkin about
the situation, but no one believes him and he has to take matters into his
own hands. It's surprising seeing Cusack here, but I believe his presence
just reinforces the satirical atmosphere. He manages to bring life to the
character, while adding suspense to the story, and yet he doesn't upstage
Cage (unlike the rivalry between Cage and Connery in "The Rock"). </P>
<P>The majority of the film consists of the action it promises and delivers
well. The story isn't concerned with a general plot, but with many individual
sub-plots that each have their own build-ups and payoffs. This allows for
lots of shoot-outs, explosions, and out-running of fireballs, but the pacing
flows smoothly and the story always remains interesting. The satire is
consistent and provides for a  "self-aware" atmosphere, so we get lines like:
"I'm going to save the day;" "Somehow they managed to pack every freak in the
world on this plane;" and (after seeing a Corvette dangling from the plane by
a rope) "On any other day that might seem strange."</P>
<P>I'll admit "Con Air" isn't the most intelligent film ever made. Sometimes
the action is exhausting and the cliches are lame, but for the most part it
is enjoyable - and isn't that all we really want in a movie?</P>
