<PRE>                               MO' MONEY
                     A film review by Too FAT Guys
                      Copyright 1992 by Roger & Me</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:        A long time ago, I vowed never to see a movie whose trailer
        included a list of soundtrack artists.  The way I figure it, if
        the producer can't dredge up enough decent clips for a preview,
        the movie can't be very good.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:        You would do well to listen to yourself.</PRE>
<P>Roger:  Yes.  Theaters started showing trailers for MO' MONEY about
        two months ago with a prominent screen enumerating all of the
        artists on the soundtrack.  Ironically, the soundtrack provided
        the second funniest line in the movie.</P>
<P>Roger:        The scintillating Jam and Lewis soundtrack aside, this comedy-
        action-romance-with-a-twist-of-social-conscience portrays the
        story of a young man, Johnny Stewart (Damon Wayans) and his
        brother, Seymour (Marlon Wayans), two inner-city hustlers.
        When Johnny meets an attractive credit card company executive,
        he decide to find a real job to attract her.  The story becomes
        interesting when Johnny becomes unwillingly involved in an
        elaborate scheme of crime credit card fraud.</P>
<PRE>Roger:        However, this all seems to be a bit beyond this director.  And
        who is the director, Roger?</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:        I forgot to write it down and I can't remember ... saves me the
        trouble of trying to forget about him later.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:        Ooh, you're mean.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:        Thank you.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:  Anyway, most of the obvious comedy effort is expended in the
        several scam scenes (a la "In Living Color").  These seem
        universally pointless and especially unfunny.  But maybe I just
        don't get it....</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:        Pathetically unfunny, even.  I've been fond of Damon Wayans's
        other work, but he couldn't recreate the comedic magic that
        makes "In Living Color" work so well.  In fact, several of the
        bits are very derivative of his work on ILC.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:        The action, as well, seems rather flaccid.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:        Don't you mean the romance?</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:        Yes, but I'll get to that later.  Aside from being unconvincing
        and unrealistic beyond suspension of disbelief, the action is
        cliched.  I don't think they used a single original stunt.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:        Not that I remember.  The action was sort of a cross between
        DIE HARD and THE LAST BOY SCOUT.  Of course, in those movies
        I was willing to believe that the protagonist was capable of
        amazing feats.        Street hustlers have never impressed me as
        being very Rambo-esque.         Didn't you have something to say about
        the romance?</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:        Oy.  Don't even get me started.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:        But how could you pass up commenting on such a cornucopia of
        misogyny?  After all, a good part of the supposed comedy
        involves Damon and Marlon avoiding the advances of the
        "Godzilla" woman.  You'd think they could just say no.  I guess
        that wouldn't have been funny though.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:        Either, you mean.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:        Oh, yes.  My mistake.  In addition, all the male characters in
        the movie view women as money-grubbing hoes.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:        Not to mention, the actual relationship of the film was carried
        out almost entirely in the form of an MTV montage.  Even the
        obligatory love scene was filmed through shower glass.  As if
        blurry images and grainy film make for great romance.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:        Even so, the film wasn't a total bust.        After all, there's the
        twist of social conscience.</PRE>
<P>Roger:  Yes, it does have some sad commentary on the results of
        Reagan's voodoo economics.  For instance, while holding a
        full-time job, Johnny can't make ends meet until he supplements
        his income through illegal means.</P>
<PRE>Roger:        In fact, the movie's portrayal of inner city living seems
        relatively accurate.  It's good to see films whose
        African-American characters are not stamped from the same
        prejudiced cliche'.  Unfortunately, without a plot to support
        this film's one redeeming quality, I have to give it a thumbs
        down.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:  I think there is a little more to be said for the positive
        aspects of this film.  For instance, a couple of the minor
        characters were handled competently and Marlon showed potential
        in his screen debut.  But overall, I have to agree with you,
        Roger.  I give this film a thumbs down.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:        So, two thumbs down for MO' MONEY.  Or should I say, "Hated It!"?
        That's all for now -- the tty is closed.</PRE>
<PRE>.
