<P>Last fall, I had a brief encounter with Muhammad Ali at a political fund 
raiser in Indianapolis. Through dumb luck, I happened to be in the right 
place at the right time and was able to speak to Ali and his wife for a 
few moments. It was thrilling, of course, but I left feeling awful, and 
cried on the way home. The sight of this amazing man, legendary for his 
brilliant physical and verbal skills, left palsied and muzzled by 
Parkinson's syndrome was almost too tragic to watch. Ali has repeatedly 
made it clear that his mind remains sharp and he doesn't want to be 
pitied, but pity him I did. 
Over the months, I came to realize that I was wrong. Muhammad Ali is not 
tragic, he is as valiant as ever. Despite his affliction, he makes 
frequent public appearances for people and causes in which he believes, 
showing the same defiance towards Parkinson's syndrome that he has 
brandished at the many foes he has faced throughout his magnificent 
career. Ali remains an inspiration to all, the consummate hero.
"When We Were Kings," which just won an Oscar for Best Documentary, 
beautifully captures one of the highlights of Ali's career, 1974's 
"Rumble In The Jungle" with George Foreman in Zaire. The fight came 
during a period when Ali was one of America's most controversial figures. 
Having alienated some by joining the Black Muslim movement and dropping 
his birth name, Ali enraged many by refusing induction into the military 
on grounds of conscientious objection. He was dragged through the legal 
system and stripped of his boxing title, all at a time when his skills 
were at their peak. 
Then fight promoter Don King, only three years out of prison for 
manslaughter, organized the "Rumble In The Jungle," giving Ali the chance 
to regain the title from George Foreman. Foreman, now beloved for his 
warmth, rich humor and easygoing manner, was a far different man then. 
Fresh from a ghetto neighborhood in Houston, Foreman was a sullen 25 year 
old, a ferocious warrior who had destroyed Joe Frazier and Ken Norton, 
men who had previously defeated Ali. Foreman was the clear favorite going 
into the match. King promised each fighter $5 million, despite having no 
financing in place. The shady promoter eventually got the money from 
Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's ruthless, egomaniacal dictator, who viewed the 
fight as a public relations coup for his country and himself. In addition 
to the fight, King organized a three-day black music festival, featuring 
James Brown, B.B. King, the Spinners, Miriam Makeba, and the Crusaders. 
The fight and festival were promoted as a major display of racial pride; 
proud black men and women returning to the motherland to celebrate their 
heritage. 
All of the elements were in place for what proved to be a mesmerizing, 
often surreal, media circus. Leon Gast's documentary captures the event 
brilliantly, mixing the ‘74 footage with recent interviews from Norman 
Mailer, George Plimpton, Thomas Hauser (Ali's biographer) and Zaire 
artist Malik Bowens. Gast creates a real air of suspense, despite the 
fact that the outcome of the fight is well-known. Through sharp editing, 
he paints a fascinating multi-colored portrait of the event that succeeds 
on many levels. 
Ali's amazing poems and speeches are all there, delivered with a pure 
sense of euphoria. But Gast keeps the camera on Ali after his speeches 
wind down, with telling results. We see Ali groping for words, laughing 
at his own absurdity, and occassionally, you can see the fear and doubt 
in his eyes. 
The details of the event, and the circus surrounding it, are all there. 
Foreman's confusion over Ali receiving all of the attention despite the 
fact that *he* was the champion. The Americans arriving in Zaire dressed 
in traditional African clothing, only to be greeted by Zaireans nattily 
attired in business suits. Bad fashion and great music combine to capture 
a clear sense of ‘70's culture. Gast also presents the harsh racial and 
political realities of the time, using a light hand that allows the 
audience to consider those issues without onscreen editorializing.
And then, of course, there's the actual fight. Even those who are not 
sports fans will be mesmerized by Ali's brilliant strategy, underscored 
with excellent commentary. The fight is absolutely exhilarating to 
witness.
It took over 20 years of financial and legal battles for Gast to bring 
"When We Were Kings" to the screen, with outstanding results. Beyond 
creating an exceptional documentary, Gast reminds us of the majesty of 
Muhammad Ali, a man who was, and is, a hero for the ages.</P>
