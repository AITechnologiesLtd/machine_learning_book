<PRE>                            A film review by 
                            Alex Lopez-Ortiz</PRE>
<P>Think of a movie that is entertaining, yet deep; intelligent but not 
uncomprehensible; a movie about events of normal daily life, but with 
a truly original plot. Make it funny, but not a comedy. Serious, but
not preachy. </P>
<P>Sounds impossible? The Truman Show proves that it can be done. </P>
<P>One of the best movies produced by Hollywood in recent memory, The Truman 
Show succeeds in such a scale that, to quote movie critic Don Irvine,
"at times it contends for 'best film of the decade'." </P>
<P>Now when was the last time you heard a critic say such things about 
a movie starring Jim Carrey?</P>
<P>This film is not without its risks. It presuposes the general public 
dislikes art films because of their snobery and slow pace, but if only 
one made the whole experience entertaining and non-elitist, the public 
would enjoy intelligent material as much as they do watching action 
film or romantic comedies.</P>
<P>To judge from this week's box office receipts it is so.</P>
<PRE>Rating: 9.5 out of 10</PRE>
