                       A film review by Zak Forsman
                        Copyright 1996 Zak Forsman</PRE>
<P>Ugggh!!!
         I just came from Eraser and I'm crying.  This is the most
horrible, horrible film I've had to see all year.  Worse than Twister,
worse than Mission Implausible.  Thank God I didn't have to pay for it.  I
co-write a review column here in Pittsburgh, PA and I cannot find it in my
heart to recommend this movie to anyone--at all.  For starters, I am sick
and tired of lines like: "Clean up this mess." after the head bad guy
kills someone.  Or when a 'good' character turns 'bad' and says it's
because,"I'm a businessman."  What garbage, man.  Total trash.  Why, why,
why are women in films always weak-minded and innocent.  I mean Vanessa
Williams was introduced as a "bonified honest person."  Is this what the
screenwriters think of honest people?  Anyway, what troubles me is that
when characters like her's show an act of strength, we're supposed to
automatically cheer.  What the hell is that?  I'll tell you, it's a lack
of respect and confidence in the movegoer.  They play it safe with what's
familiar to us and, unfortunately, we often do what they expect.  Also,
with regard to her character--must the woman always be the victim of
beatings by antagonists out to prove just how bad they can be?  Or what's
even more common, to be used as a hostage/body sheild?  Okay, minus that
aspect I will concede that the rest of the film. . . . . . . was just as
bad.  How does Arnold survive smashing down the roof of a car?  No broken
anythings?  Oh, he must really be the Terminator, I get it now.  And
another thing--was there truly anyone out there that watched the
introduction of James Caan's character that didn't think he was either
going to be the 'mentor that gets killed' or the 'good guy that has sold
out'?  And those damn aligators were too big and too pissed off don't you
think?  I mean they were growling!!!  Come on!  I guess living in an
aquarium will do that to you.  So then, what the hell were they feeding
those things anyway?  The same thing they fed the hippo from Congo? 
Probably.  Lastly, the guy from the opening scene that helps Arnold out
during the end.  Tell me we haven't seen this character of the funny
buffoon sidekick in countless versions.  Just tell me.  Oh, and thank God
for small-time mafia hoods, too.  As I watched the movie I kept a list of
redeeming qualities.  I have two.  Most of the bit-part characters,
despite they were walking cliches, were funny and about a handful of the
one-liners were just hysterical.  Buuuut, unless you enjoy seeing the same
Hollywood fare you've been spoon-fed since Arnold's Commando in 1986, do
yourself a favor and avoid this one.  It was horrible.</P>
