<PRE>                                 PRIEST
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A young and idealistic priest is
          forced to choose between two evils, one is
          immediate and personal, one is more abstract but
          more fundamental to the beliefs of the Catholic
          Church.  Gad, I love a film that presents a
          sophisticated moral dilemma, treats the audience as
          adults, and gives no pat answers.  Rating: low +3
          (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Even the most idealistic laws can be only an approximation of
justice.  Criminals who hurt other people can hide behind the Fifth
Amendment of the Constitution.  They are given that right by the law so
that the law can be used to prevent larger injustices.  In A MAN FOR
ALL SEASONS the character Sir Thomas More puts it extremely succinctly
by saying, "I give the Devil benefit of law for my own safety's sake."
(That is a great scene, by the way.  I consider it the best single
scene in any film I know.)  What is true of the laws of this country is
also true of the laws of the Catholic Church.  It is a terrible
responsibility to have to allow in the name of a law a very bad evil to
continue in order to serve a greater good.  And that is the
responsibility that nearly destroys the young and idealistic Father
Greg in Antonia Byrd's PRIEST, a film from a powerful screenplay by
Jimmy McGovern.</P>
<P>     Father Greg (played by Linus Roache) is a young and high-minded
priest sent a rough Liverpool parish.  He is there to replace an older
priest who was fired when he fell from favor with his superiors.  "Time
to move on, old son," they told him insensitively.  His replacement is
Father Greg, who has little sympathy for priests or parishioners who do
not live by the rules of the Church.  This immediately puts him into
conflict with Father Matthew (Tom Wilkinson), the other presiding
priest of the parish.  Matthew is more worldly and more tolerant of
failure and sin.  The two priests immediately have philosophical
differences effectively over whether to follow the letter or the spirit
of church law.  But any chance Matthew might have in convincing Greg is
lost when Greg discovers Matthew is sleeping with the housekeeper,
Maria Kerrigan (Cathy Tyson).  This is just the sort of decadence that
Father Greg abhors, but he cannot completely condemn, knowing that
secretly he himself has desires that would make him a sinner in the
eyes of the Church.  Greg, who came to Liverpool reasonably confident
that he has all the answers, finds to his shock that there are
questions deeper than his answers go.  Like the main character in
Nathaniel West's MISS LONELYHEARTS, Greg is unprepared for the real-
world problems of the people around him.  Soon all this is overwhelmed
by his learning in the confessional of a terrible evil going on.  He
cannot take action without breaking his vow to protect the seal of
privacy of the confessional.  His choice of protecting the Church at
the expense of one of his parishioners, combined with his knowledge
that he is breaking other Church rules, places him in the jaws of a
crushing moral dilemma.</P>
<P>     The cast of PRIEST is mostly unfamiliar--the exceptions being
Cathy Tyson of MONA LISA and John Bennett, a veteran of 70's horror
films and episodes of "Doctor Who," here playing a priest so straight-
laced and old school he insists on speaking in Latin over dinner.
Still the acting is magnetic with especially good performances from
Roache and Wilkinson.</P>
<P>     It is perhaps ironic that members of the Catholic Church should
choose this film to protest.  McGovern's script could easily have made
the Church appear entirely wrong.  A lesser writer might have done
that.  Most American films make it obvious which side is correct in any
conflict.  But the dilemma in this film really is a dilemma and there
are good arguments on each side.  McGovern leaves it to the viewer to
decide whether Greg has done the right thing or not.  That is genuinely
refreshing.  I give PRIEST a low +3 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
