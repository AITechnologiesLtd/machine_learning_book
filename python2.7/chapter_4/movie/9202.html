   "Destiny," which takes place in the Andalucia of the 12th
century, looks like something that could have been taken from
the 10 o'clock CNN news.  Its theme is deeply political: a
complex struggle between the forces of Islamic
fundamentalism and the vigor of moderation over what
doctrine will rule over what is now a Spanish province.  While
the story, transported to the end of the 20th century, could
relate to the ongoing civil war in Algeria or the disturbances
by extremists in Egypt or the struggle between Muslim
fundamentalists in Senegal against the moderate government
there, it could also serve as a parable of cult movements here
in the United States.
   Youssef Chahine, known as Egypt's foremost film-maker--
and a prolific one at that--has knocked out quite a few
commercial items, but when Gamal Abdul Nasser pushed
Pan-Arabism in his bid to rule over the entire Middle East,
Chahine directed the nationalistic epic "El Naser Sallah-e-
din/Salladin.  After Egypt's defeat by Israel in the 1967 war,
he continued at the helm of political dramas.  "Destiny" could
scarcely be called anything but polemical.
   "Destiny," an Egyptian-France co-production, was filmed in
Lebanon and Syria, which look more like the Andalucia of the
12th century than today's province--which is overrun by
tourists in search of sun, flamenco, and bullfights and gypsy
caves.  It centers on the character of Abu ibn Rushd, the Arab
philosopher known as Averroes (Nour el Cherif), who, like
Socrates in ancient Athens had formed a nucleus of students
eager to discuss his teachings and his books.  Averroes
taught nothing more scandalous--or so we in the West think--
than that the way to treat religion is to combine revelation with
reason.  What is in the Koran is subject to interpretation, he
said, in much the way the Martin Luther later felt that the
common people should be able to read and understand the
Bible for themselves.  For this "heresy," his books were
burned, some of his followers went up in smoke, and
governments teeted on the edge of oblivion.  The young son
of the Caliph (Mahmoud Hemeida), a womanizer (Muhamed
Mounir) who is at first apolitical, is converted to
fundamentalism in just three weeks, a phenomenon made
possible by members of an extremist cult who used flattery to
persuade him of his "greatness" as a poet.  As Andalucia
prepared for ideological warfare, Averroes, unable to protect
his many books, ultimately laughs at a burning ceremony
since, he believed, ideas have wings.  Flames cannot stop
their flight.
   What might have been a sober inquiry into the conflict
between moderation and fundamentalism combined with
striking visuals of the topography and debates among the
various sides has instead become a cowboy movie filled with
the sorts of characters you find today in light Indian
romances.  As a swashbuckler, few things in "Destiny" seem
right: rather, the picture appears to come at us from a past
era when Tom Mix and Gabby Hayes reigned supreme.  The
songs which are interspersed give a musical-comedy feel to
the work, and that's just fine.
   In a post-screening press conference, director Chahine
convinces us that God wants us to be happy, to sing and to
dance, and he admits to doing quite a bit of both ever at 4 in
the morning.  As one of his characters says, "We'll sing day
in, day out, for the rest of our lives."  If only everyone in the
Middle East felt that way!  Chahine's heart is in the right place
with "Destiny," but the stereotypical portrayals undermine his
purport.  The film was screened at the 1997 New York Film Festival
and awaits a distributor.  Not Rated.  Running Time: 135 minutes.
