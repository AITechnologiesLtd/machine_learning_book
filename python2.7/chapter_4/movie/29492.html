<P>Most of the action in "Strawberry and Chocolate" takes place in 
Diego's (Jorge Perugorría) living room, a gay character struggling 
with sexual and cultural repression in the Cuba of 1979. Despite 
this, it opens up a vast panorama of the human heart. In these close 
quarters overflowing with symbols of the homosexual demimonde, Diego 
attempts to seduce David (Vladimir Cruz), an earnest but dogmatic 
member of the Young Communist League attending college. However, it 
is Cuban society itself that is ultimately being seduced in this 
remarkable state-sponsored film.</P>
<P>Diego initially lures David to the apartment with a promise of photos 
that Diego took of him performing in a college play. After arriving 
there, Diego showers him with all the forbidden fruit that a good 
Communist would deny himself, from English tea served in fine china 
to Maria Callas arias. David is simultaneously repelled by and 
attracted to his host. Although the thought of gay sex is the last 
thing on his mind, he finds himself drawn into Diego's nonstop, 
impromptu lecture on fine literature and the need to be cultured, 
even in a revolutionary society. After Diego announces that he cannot 
find the photos, both the audience and David understand that this is 
just a ploy to get him to return.</P>
<P>And he does return. At first, under his room-mate's advice, he 
returns to "gather intelligence" about this sexual and political 
subversive, especially his role in organizing a sculpture exhibit by 
a gay artist and friend, whose work mixes Christian iconography and 
elements of sadism. Diego complains openly to David that art in Cuba 
is either shallow propaganda spoon-fed to the masses or clumsy 
attempts at modernism. After a few more visits, David begins to warm 
up to Diego as a human being, while Diego also begins to forget about 
seduction.</P>
<P>Starting out as a hard-liner, David defends the status quo by stating 
that you have to make a choice between the class struggle and its 
enemies "out there", pointing at Miami and Washington. Despite this, 
he continues to be drawn in by Diego's refined sensibilities and 
charisma. While some American critics have found fault with the 
character's campy mannerisms, there is much more to him than a limp 
wrist and a lisp. In scene after scene, he insists that unless there 
is room for him and people like him in the revolution, then it is not 
a genuine revolution. For the revolution to triumph, it needs an open 
mind toward sexuality and culture. As he puts it, "The best is not to 
be shocked by anything, and to sip from every cup.'"</P>
<P>Made in 1993, "Strawberry and Chocolate" was the last film directed 
by Tomás Gutiérrez Alea, who was dying of cancer. Juan Carlos Tabío, 
who, like Alea, makes films that serve as a prod to the social 
conscience of Cuba, co-directed. In his latest film "The Waiting 
List," Tabío takes aim at bureaucratic inertia in a bus station. The 
two stars of "Strawberry and Chocolate" are reunited there, with Cruz 
starring as an audacious young engineer organizing the transformation 
of the station and Perugorría as a mechanic feigning blindness just 
so he can get to the head of lines.</P>
<P>The willingness of such Cuban films to take aim at entrenched and 
backward political and social institutions should challenge critics 
of Cuban communism to reflect on the usefulness of such terms as 
"Stalinist" or "bureaucratic." In bourgeois society, change generally 
comes through pressure on the government, while state cinema in Cuba 
seems to exist in large part to exhort society to adapt to a changing 
world.</P>
<P>Even the mainstream press in the United States is waking up to new 
Cuban realities. The Atlanta Journal and Constitution (March 19, 
1995) reports:</P>
<P>--- 
Because he was gay, Reynaldo Garcia once was ostracized as a member 
of "La Escoria," the official Cuban government term for homosexuals, 
convicts and the mentally ill. It means "the scum." </P>
<P>Now Garcia can do something he never dreamed would be possible - walk 
hand in hand down the streets of Havana with his lover of six years 
without fear of reprisal. </P>
<P>"I never thought I would see this day. It's a beautiful feeling," 
Garcia said. "I feel like people are starting to see us as human 
beings, like anyone else." Cuba is backing away from years of 
discrimination against homosexuals. Once packed off to work on rural 
farms alongside dissidents and religious Cubans, or nudged into 
exile, gays have entered a period of tolerance.  
---</P>
<P>In 1995 Havana held its First International Transvestite Festival, a 
celebration of Cuban-style camp in which prancing female 
impersonators aped Whitney Houston, Tina Turner and Diana Ross to a 
dazzled audience sprinkled with fellow cross-dressers. </P>
<P>After the appearance of "Strawberry and Chocolate," one Communist 
Party leader took Alea aside told him he was ashamed to see himself 
in the cinematic portrayal of a homophobic party hard-liner. </P>
<P>In a gay-oriented email list, U.S. citizen Larry R. Oberg commented 
on his trip to Cuba:</P>
<P>"What I found in Cuba was a gay community with many parallels to the 
gay community in North America and a few differences as well. For one 
thing, there are no laws on the Cuban books that discriminate against 
gays. (This is to be contrasted with the United States where all too 
many states retain outdated sodomy laws and where, increasingly, 
repressive legislation is enacted at the state level.) I have talked 
with literally hundreds of gays (mostly men) in Cuba and I found none 
who believe they are being persecuted by their government. 
Discrimination by individuals is reported, however, and there is also 
a lot of resentment of the residual macho attitudes that remain 
stubbornly embedded in some levels of Cuban society, attitudes that 
perpetuate highly dichotomized sex roles and prejudice against 
homosexuals amongst the population at large. But none reported active 
or systematic repression by the state. </P>
<P>"It seems to me that it is important to put Cuba's past record of 
mistreatment of gays in its proper perspective. For example, 
thirty-five or so years ago, in Boise, Idaho, hundreds of gay men 
were persecuted, driven from their homes and families and imprisoned 
in one of the more infamous anti-gay actions in our history. Florida 
itself has a dreadful record in terms of gay rights and only about 10 
years ago in Adrian, Michigan, the police staked out a public park 
for months and then arrested over 30 men at their homes, in front of 
their wives and children and, in a couple of cases, grand-children. 
(With one exception, all of these guys were married self-identified 
heterosexuals.) Cuba's past record on gay rights may be no better 
than our own, certainly nothing to be proud of, but in my experience 
gays in today's Cuba are better off than they are in any other Latin 
American society (check the murder rate in Rio) and better off than 
they are in many states in our Union (think Matthew Shepherd). </P>
<P>"Cuban society, like most North American and European societies, is 
undergoing a profound review and reconceptualization of its attitudes 
towards gays and lesbians. Most of you probably know about the film 
Strawberry and Chocolate, the first Cuban film to deal openly and 
directly with homosexuality. (If you haven't seen it, I recommend 
it.) What you may not know is that the film was wildly popular in 
Cuba (indicating, no doubt, a repressed need to talk about this 
issue). Apparently it played simultaneously at 10 or 12 theatres in 
Havana for months to lines several blocks long. </P>
<P>"Another seminal incident along the road to acceptance for Cuban gays 
occurred in 1996. Pablo Milanes, a Cuban nova trova singer who has 
achieved quasi-sainthood amongst the island's population, wrote a 
song about gay men entitled Original Sin (available on his CD 
entitled Origines), a song he dedicated to all Cuban homosexuals. 
Introduced at his annual holiday concert held in the vast Karl Marx 
Theater in the Miramar neighborhood of Havana, El Pecado original 
took the audience and the country by storm and did much to advance 
the cause of gay acceptance."</P>

<P>I rented "Strawberry and Chocolate" on Friday night in an attempt to 
clear my mind of the World Trade Center disaster. The streets were 
flooded with American flags and overhead you could hear the roar of 
F-16's, part of the Praetorian Guard assigned to President Bush.</P>
<P>As the USA prepares for war and all the awful consequences flowing 
from that, I am struck by the differences between this country and 
Cuba. As the crisis of the 21st century deepens, the sclerotic mob 
running the White House looks to answers from 1898, while Cuba, a 
country that was a victim of that trumped-up war, looks into the 
future. For a way out of this impasse, it seems that the answers will 
be found in Cuba, a country whose material poverty is more than 
compensated by the grandness of spirit found in "Strawberry and 
Chocolate."</P>
