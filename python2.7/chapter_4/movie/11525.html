<P>Fresh off his incredibly successful turn as Jack Dawson in James
Cameron's TITANIC, Leonardo DiCaprio has immensely increased his
popularity to the point of becoming possibly the most famous actor of
his generation.  There is no doubt that both Kate Winslet and DiCaprio
will be able to carry films by themselves, however DiCaprio already had
popularity from his Oscar-nominated turn in the fantastic WHAT'S EATING
GILBERT GRAPE?  It's almost ironic that his film opens thirteen weeks
after TITANIC did.  And, more than likely, it will unseat the Cameron
flick for the top of the box office.  Unfortunately, it will not remain
there.</P>
<P>THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK is one of those gorgeous films that contains
beautiful imagery, colorful costumes, and terrific actors.  However,
what it lacks is good writing.  Watching this film, I saw a story hidden
below the surface of the film that was just waiting to be uncovered.
This film never does it.  It remains a superficially obsessed mess that
cares more about viewers paying to see it than letting viewers become
involved.   This kind of Hollywood thinking has destroyed many films in
that past that could have amounted to great things.  I'm not saying
Hollywood is bad, as I love it.  It's the directors and writers and
producers who think that audiences want more.  Someone should tell them
that we actually prefer less.  And that's The Man in the Iron Mask's
biggest problem: too much of everything, but too little of what we
really want.</P>
<P>THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK begins well enough, proudly displaying its
gorgeous scenery and vibrant costumes.  Surprisingly, the film begins
its quick descent into mediocrity at the appearance of DiCaprio as King
Louis XIV.  Louis is a pompous, arrogant, and young king, and yet he has
a following, mostly from the upper class society.  The lower class is
extremely poor, not even able to afford something to eat (and what there
is to eat is rotten).  They riot and cry for help, but Louis is more
worried with how many women he can sleep with at once, or how he can
attract a certain woman to him.  This woman is Christine (Judith
Godrèche).  She is beautiful, fair-skinned--and engaged.  Well, almost
engaged, for her love, Raoul (Peter Sarsgaard), can't find the opportune
time to pop the question (I'm not sure, but weren't engagements setup by
the parents back then?).  Unfortunately, before Raoul can ask her, Louis
"arranges" for him to be sent to the front lines of the war against the
Dutch.</P>
<P>With all of the poverty and hatred in the city, the king does need
guards.  One of them is D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne), a loyal follower of
Louis and captain of the Musketeers.  However, he happens to be good
friends with the infamous Three Musketeers (I still don't know why
they're called three--there are really four of them!).  Athos (John
Malkovich) is retired, and happens to be the father of Raoul (I smell a
plot convention).  Porthos (Gérard Depardieu) is also retired, although
he spends most of his time flatulently cracking jokes.  Aramis (Jeremy
Irons) is now a priest, but is also retired from the Musketeers.  After
Raoul's death, Athos proclaims that he will kill the king and anyone who
stands in his way.  Unfortunately, D'Artagnan maintains his loyalty to
his king, and won't allow Athos to proceed with his promise.  Athos
meets with Porthos and Aramis again, and tells them that he wants to
replace the king.</P>
<P>This is where the man in the iron mask comes into play.  Prior to this
moment, we have seen him only in agony in his cell.  However, now the
three come to release him from the mask.  They find that the man in the
mask looks exactly like Louis himself.  The next hour involves the three
trying to replace the king with Philippe (DiCaprio).  This is where the
film should have begun.  The screenplay, by Randall Wallace (who also
wrote BRAVEHEART), focuses on the wrong part of the story, and thus
destroys what could have been a highly entertaining film.  Wallace, who
this time also directs the film, seems determined to show that Louis
was, in fact, a completely evil person with no redeeming qualities
whatsoever.  Many people complained about Cal in TITANIC as being too
heartless and inhuman.  Here's a character that those people should
really be complaining against.  Louis practically has no good in him,
using his crown to pleasure himself.  Wallace focuses nearly two-thirds
of the film on this alone, and frankly, it gets extremely boring.  Most
everything that progresses in the "setup" could have been done in half
an hour, leaving the rest of the film open for exploration of the
dilemmas that surround replacing the king with Philippe, or the problems
in the city, or the romantic relationship between D'Artagnan and the
Queen Mother, Anne d'Autriche (Anne Parillaud).</P>
<P>Of course, THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK isn't completely horrid.  The final
thirty minutes is what the whole film should have been: enticing,
entertaining, and completely engrossing.  The swash-buckling action is
what most people have come to see, but we are left with iconic
characters skewered to miserable little men who don't pick up a sword
for an hour and a half.  Instead, Wallace hopes that the melodramatic
scenes towards the beginning cover up any poor writing.  It doesn't.  It
does, however, make the audience more aware of the flaws, as we
constantly have more time before something interesting happens.  And
yes, I will admit it--I nearly dozed off twice during the film.  Granted
I was tired prior the film, but normally a movie will keep me awake
throughout.  THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK had nothing to keep my interest,
and only towards the end did I sit enthralled.  Of course, it really
isn't worthwhile to sit through ninety minutes of poorly constructed and
convoluted story telling to get to these thirty minutes of refreshing
and energetic action.</P>
<P>One of the most obvious flaws of the film lies in the dialogue.  While
watching this movie, I was more aware than ever of how film is such a
different medium from the stage or a novel.  The silver screen has the
ability to show what the characters think or say, and yet most films
lean towards dialogue to propel the narrative.  Sometimes this is
effective (THE USUAL SUSPECTS), but here it isn't.  Lines like "I am
doing this because I feel guilty" are almost laughably oblivious to the
cinematic strategies that could have been implemented to portray this
same feeling.  There is also an incredible amount of anachronistic
humor, such as Porthos' mannerisms.  Did people refer to breasts as
"tits"?  Did people just passively "break wind"?  And one of the most
obvious attempts at cheap humor comes when Porthos tries to kill himself
by hanging himself (he also happens to be nude at this time).  I wonder
if Alexandre Dumas had written these into his novel, but I doubt it.  It
seems that he would have more taste then to lower himself to the
inclusion of bodily functions for humor.  Over time, the
"playing-for-the-audience" humor becomes more annoying than funny.</P>
<P>The cast does its best to work with the material at hand.  However,
DiCaprio is definitely miscast as King Louis/Philippe.  DiCaprio is
actually rather good as Philippe, but considering that two roles had to
be played by the same person, DiCaprio wasn't a good choice.  This is
yet another Hollywoodism, as producers try to benefit from his
popularity with the young women (though I bet they didn't realize how
much his success with TITANIC would help the film).  As Louis, DiCaprio
is almost unbearable to watch.  Perhaps this is just due to the writing,
but his cocky appearance is more of an artificial try at seeming
important.  His well-mannered Philippe is fully realized, though he
doesn't come into play for a very long time.  But it is Gabriel Byrne
who steals virtually every scene in the film.  His thoughtful and
emotional performance is the most interesting and captivating, and his
character does get quite a bit of screen time (though I wish it would
have focused on him more).  John Malkovich is energetic and fun as
Athos, and Peter Sarsgaard does a frightfully realistic impersonation of
his son.  Depardieu is just annoying as Porthos, as he tries to hide his
French accent (which is rather ironic considering that this is the one
time that he actually should have one).  Jeremy Irons is deliciously
mysterious, as we can't determine whether or not he is a good guy or a
bad guy (though it probably could have been even less clearly defined).
Both Anne Parillaud and Judith Godrèche provide nice and understated
performances as the only two important females in the story.  But Byrne
steals the film, and his scenes with Parillaud are some of the most
energetic in the whole movie.</P>
<P>As production values go, THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK is top-notch.  The
sets are visually stunning, with a castle that defies verbal
explanation.  The lush scenery radiates in each and every scene.  The
costumes are appropriate and provide an equal to the scenery.  The
cinematography captures the film with an almost dream-like quality.  The
camera captures the costumes and sets with pleasure, showing off the
incredible amount of work that must have gone in to producing the film.
The score by Nick Glennie-Smith is lush and epic, making it seem just
like the period piece that it is.  However, sometimes the music jumps
too quickly from cheerful to depressing.  But overall, the music is
probably the best thing in the film.</P>
<P>THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK is rated PG-13 for sequences of violence and
some sensuality/nudity.  With gorgeous cinematography (the unveiling of
the man in the mask is the best scene, visually, in the film) and a
wonderful supporting cast, one would have thought this movie would have
been better than it really is.  With no solid foundation from the
screenplay, everything else becomes window dressing, making a poorly
constructed film look better than it is.  It's sad that such a good and
talented cast is wasted in this motion picture.  It just goes to show
that the writing is probably the most important feature in a film.  Even
Wallace's confident direction can't save it.  Overall, just a big
disappointment.  My recommendation: go see TITANIC again, and help it
become number one for a thirteenth week.</P>
