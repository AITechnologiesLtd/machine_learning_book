<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 and a half stars</P>
<P>Sure, there's plenty of action, a lot of cool special effects and some
good looking leads, but somewhere along the line The Mummy lost my
winning vote. Perhaps it was the film's absence of a good villain and a
thrilling climax, or maybe it was because the whole darn thing was just
too exhausting.  During the first hour or so of the film, I was
convinced that it embodied few elements of standard Hollywood big-budget
movies.  But sure enough, The Mummy does eventually succumb to formulaic
filmmaking and, to make matters worse, draws its climax out so long that
you begin to forget what the hell the heroes were fighting for.  There
are plenty of scenes of pure carnage - all of which are staged quite
nicely - that brought back faint recollections of a far superior film,
>From Dusk Till Dawn, which succeeded in almost revolutionizing the
horror genre due to its total disregard for conventional filmmaking.</P>
<P>Well, The Mummy hasn't exactly done that, but it didn't need to.  It's
one of those films that are so obviously written to be commercially
successful - often at the expense of any artistic merit - and usually
leave most audiences content after viewing the plot elements that they
have come to expect and appreciate.  But The Mummy did not always
entertain me, and only occasionally intrigued me.  A couple of good
reasons to see the film are its special effects, which bring atmosphere
into the picture, and Brendan Fraser's comically heroic performance
which indeed reminds us that we will be seeing a lot more of him in the
future.  You might enjoy seeing The Mummy just for its special effects,
but on these merits, The Phantom Menace is a masterpiece.</P>
