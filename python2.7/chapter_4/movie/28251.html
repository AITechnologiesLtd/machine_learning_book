<P>     The pleasure of Shrek is in its gleeful naughtiness, like a kid at 
the dinner table doing disgusting things with food to make a mother 
throw her hands up in mock despair.  The title character (adapted from 
the William Steig book of the same name) is an ogre who revels in 
revulsion.  He bathes in muck, brushes his teeth in slime, and pulls wax 
out of his ears to make candles.  And he wants nothing more than to be 
left alone.</P>
<P>     He's not evil, of course.  When the townspeople make their periodic 
forays with flaming torches into his swamp to slay or capture him, he 
scares them off good-naturedly, but he doesn't hurt them. </P>
<P>     But things take an unacceptable turn when Shrek's swamp suddenly 
fills up with refugees - Pinocchio, the Seven Dwarfs, the Three Little 
Pigs, and a bunch of other fairytale creatures who have been exiled by 
Lord Farquaad (voice of John Lithgow), a pint-sized aristocrat so nasty 
he tortures the Gingerbread Man by dunking him in milk.  Shrek (Mike 
Myers doing his Fat Bastard brogue from Austin Powers) demands that the 
unwelcome intruders be removed, and Farquaad agrees on the condition 
that Shrek go fetch him a princess bride (Cameron Diaz), who is being 
held captive in a castle in a distant kingdom by a dragon.  Accompanied, 
much against his wishes, by his trusty sidekick Donkey (Eddie Murphy), 
he sets out to perform the feat and win back his lonely peace of mind.  
And before it's all over, adventures have been had and lessons have been 
learned.</P>
<P>     The story is fun on its primary level, helped mightily by the 
improvisational vocal antics of Eddie Murphy, whose ingratiating Donkey 
rattles on non-stop as he tags along with the reluctant ogre.  It's a 
character not unlike the little dragon he voiced in Disney's Mulan, and 
here the Dreamworks people poke a bit of fun at that by having the big 
dragon who's guarding the princess fall for Donkey. </P>
<P>     In fact, the Dreamworks people have lots of fun at Disney's 
expense, providing another level of enjoyment for the grown-ups who take 
the kids to see this one.  The displaced characters who invade the swamp 
are clearly refugees from the Land of the Mouse, there is a brief 
send-up of Disneyland's maddening Small Small World attraction, and the 
nasty Lord Farquaad is said to bear a resemblance to Michael Eisner, 
head of Disney and nemesis of Shrek producer and Dreamworks chief 
Jeffrey Katzenberg, who was once Crown Prince of the Magic Kingdom 
before he and Eisner had a falling out and he was banished under a dark 
cloud.  (Eisner, however, is tall, and Katzenberg is short, so the 
diminutive Farquaad may be directing a wink at his own boss.)</P>
<P>     The writing is clever, although not quite up to Toy Story 
standards, and the animation is accomplished, although personally I miss 
the old style in which drawing was king.  These characters look like 
Play-Doh with bone structure; they occupy some uneasy territory between 
cartoon and real.  What they really remind me of is those old Viewmaster 
slides, where you would click your way through a story on a disc held in 
a red plastic viewer.  But the effects are wonderful, and the story is 
nicely acerbic, and there are none of those treacly Disney songs -- when 
Donkey tries to sing the ogre will only let him hum.  That alone is 
worth the price of admission.</P>
