<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The best of John Ford's trilogy about the 7th Calvary, which includes
the initial offering of Fort Apache (48) and concludes with Rio Grande
(50). John Wayne is in all three of them, playing a somewhat similar
role of a rugged officer who is fighting the Indians. Though, this film
has the advantage of the protagonist being in the twilight of his
career, having found peace within himself and who can now seek peace
with his foes without the need to apologize for it. Wayne has commented
that this is his favorite role of all the films he ever made. It is an
elegantly sentimental work touching on the rituals observed on an army
post. Ford pulls out all the strings of patriotism and what it means to
be brave in action, in order show how self-sacrificing the cavalry men
were in their dangerous role of staking out and protecting the
territories that made up the West of 1876, after Custer's defeat. But it
is most of all, the story of John Wayne, an army man, who is retiring
after a distinguished career in the service of his country, looking at
himself for one last time in uniform, where he commands the full respect
of his superiors and the men he leads. He is the ideal of what a soldier
is supposed to be like. When a spoiled rich officer who is opting to
leave the cavalry, but accepts a chew of tobacco from Wayne and sees a
gunrunner selling guns to the Indians, that's it, he's sold on staying
in the cavalry. Those were indeed more simplistic times, but not totally
out of the realm of how some modern day soldiers may feel.</P>
<P>Captain Nathan Brittles (Wayne) is about to retire in a few days from a
job that he more than loves. He is given one last assignment by Post
Commander Major Allshard (O'Brien), to escort an attractive single lady
(Dru) and the commander's wife (Natwick) out of harm's way, for them to
catch a stage away from the remote fort because the Indians have united
and are on the warpath.</P>
<P>The twists in the story line come from the quirks the characters display
not from the story itself, which is rather ordinary: the comraderie
between the captain and the very Irish top sergeant (McLaglen), who
likes a bit of whiskey and adds comic relief to the stodginess of the
army routine, fits in with the buddy theme of many Ford films. They show
complete loyalty to each other and to the army they serve. A virtue that
is considered essential for any character in a Ford movie, that he
really cares about. The romantic battle over Dru fought by the two
lieutenants, Agar and Carey, is played to the hilt, as she willfully
flirts with each, until she chooses the one she really loves. The
bravery of a corporeal (Tyler) in battle, who even when severely wounded
must finish his mission by reporting to the captain what he saw, is
looked upon with gushing respect for the soldier's valor. And, finally,
the most sentimental moments are savored for the captain talking to his
dead wife about what he did for the day, expressing a love for her that
is eternal. It adds to the feeling that the past cannot be ignored. It
is the future without the army that scares an old soldier like Wayne,
the most.</P>
<P>Winton Hoch, the cinematographer, won an Oscar for the visually
memorable mesas and haunting loneliness of the Monument Valley
landscape, which was used as the film's location sites. It provides the
film with an epic scale of the country, as there is a melancholy
intermingled in those vistas with a sense of reverie for the men who are
so far away from civilization, surrounded by the red sand and barren
mountain peaks, yet are greater practitioners of civilized etiquettes
than even the citizens back east, through their daily obediance to rank
and order and their need to socialize by formal dance and their chilvary
toward women, which might seem old-fashioned but is pleasantly
accomplished here.</P>
<P>What pulls the film together and gives it a raw power, is something that
can only be ascertained by accepting Ford's premise that it is
absolutely necessary what the men do and that they are in the right.
They have God on their side, a just country behind them, and that the
men are fighting a heroic war to make the country safe for democracy. To
scrutinize this film in any other way, is to lose track of what
direction the film meant to be going.</P>
<P>To add color and more sentimentality to the story, there is the theme
song of the yellow ribbon, played countless times, either to the immense
pleasure of most viewers or to some, to grate on their nerves. The
yellow ribbon worn by Dru, is a signal that she has chosen a boyfriend
on the post. That act was given just as much importance in the story as
the key moment of the film was, when Wayne rides into the Indian camp to
try and make peace, using the rational argument that both sides will
lose many of its brave young men who are irreplaceable by carrying on
this bloody war. Ford justifies the placing of the Indians in
reservations, as long as we treat them with respect and honor their
customs. The calvary should follow them to their reservations, but stay
out of sight so the Indians wouldn't be humiliated by the men watching
them.</P>
<P>This is Ford's look at the West and the cavalry men he adores so much.
Perhaps the scene that summarizes the film's intentions best, is when
Wayne is given a solid silver watch by the men for his retirement, and
the presenting of the gift and the accepting of it, are met with a few
well-chosen words, each weighed heavily with an aura of mutual respect,
almost bringing tears to Wayne's and the audience's eyes, as he reads
the inscription that you know means so much to him. If you can see that
as a glorious and magnificent scene, you will have, most likely, fallen
in love with this grand and lyrical film. But if you don't, you can
still be swept away by the eloquence of the film and its call for some
kind of majesty of action one should have, in this beautiful, God
created country, that Ford believes has room in it for everyone who acts
civilly.</P>
