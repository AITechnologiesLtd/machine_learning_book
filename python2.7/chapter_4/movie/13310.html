<P>Some movie titles have a facile built-in zinger that can be used by
reviewers who don't like the film. Here it would be "Out of Sight, Out of
Mind." But so far as I know, there are hardly any critical put-downs.The
picture is getting very good-to-excellent reactions. Yet so far as I am
concerned, the Out of Mind bit does apply--but not as a would-be-scathing
comment. Let me explain.</P>
<P>OOS is amusing and inventive, but at the same time, it moves in such a
here-and-there, this-and-that fashion that I find it hard to replay it in
my mind. Put it this way: it has not left in me any repercussions, the
feeling that it is both "rememberable" and memorable. Rather, it is instant
gratification. I do grant you that judgments on many a film become valid
only after a second screening, but I've had no time to do this. When it
does happen, the movie may go up a half-star, or down.</P>
<P>It opens with a tricky, clever and funny  flashback. Simpatico George
Clooney plays Jack Foley, an incorrigible bank robber. He works without
weapons and apparently gets caught  each time.Whether he is a dumb planner
or an unlucky heister, is none too clear. I am intrigued by the name Foley.
In the Beverly Hills Cop series, Eddie Murphy was Axel Foley. Except for
their sense of humor, in  many ways Jack the Robber is the opposite of Axel
the Lawman.</P>
<P>Cut to Jack's current prison. Laid-back Foley and his buddy Buddy (sic)
(Ving Rhames) break out. (The technicalities are not detailed as in
traditional  jailbreak flicks). In the process (don't ask) they kidnap US
Marshal  Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez). A reference to Siskel and Ebert? To
the Cisco Kid?</P>
<P>Buddy drives the getaway car, Karen and Jack, hidden in the trunk, have an
amusing but unlikely flirtatious conversation -- the beginning of a
beautiful affair in which Jack is after Karen romantically. She responds
but  is also professionally after Jack.</P>
<P>The source novel is by Elmore Leonard, whose idiosyncratic thrillers or
action tales have hordes of admirers. Many of his books were made into
films, including Jackie Brown, Get Shorty, Joe Kidd, Hombre, 52
Pick-up.Leonard has co-scripted some, also written original  scenarios.</P>
<P>This picture is a big change in subject and style for director Soderbergh.
After his first film ,Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989) won the Golden Palm
at Cannes, he became an instant "auteur" icon, a star among the avant-garde
of the American New Wave cinema. Rather than go commercial, he went on to
more or less low-budget "art" films. These did badly at the box-office and
by many critics. Yet his Kafka is interesting, King of the Hill very good
(and rather mainstreamish). The Underneath, Schizopolis, Gray's Anatomy,
got him nowhere. Now, his decision to shift gears into full mainstream is
paying off handsomely.</P>
<P>Out of Sight is certainly a mass-appeal movie. The plot is convoluted in a
sometimes outlandish combination of Soderberghisms and Leonardisms. It
certainly requires suspension of disbelief. In two hours, so much is thrown
in that there's enough to feed two or three different films.The dialogue
and the banter can sound outrageous but I sensed the planning and planting
of colorfulness or cuteness in it.</P>
<P>It all  feels like a hybrid: a tall tale for the majority of viewers, along
with unexpected, even gratuitous, narrative and technical slants, sorties
and sallies by the experimentalist who lies in Soderbergh's psyche.
Absurdism, expressionism and filmic unorthodoxy may not be the film's main
traits, yet they're still very much present. At times, those are welcome
touches. At times they slow down the picture, interfere with its momentum,
as in a sequence of the couple doing goo-goo eyes by a picture window, way
up in a hotel bar. The rain outside is as phoney as any I've seen.  But the
excellent,entertaining acting of all involved is the movie's greatest asset.</P>
<P>Essentially OOS belongs to the familiar sub-genre of comedies about
fumbling thieves or outlaws. It could have been worse. Or better.</P>
