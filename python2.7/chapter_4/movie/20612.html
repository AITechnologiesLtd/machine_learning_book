<P>Susan Granger's review of "GUINEVERE' (Miramax Films)</P>
<P>            What do you do when you're 20 years old, the youngest in a
wealthy San Francisco family of over-achieving attorneys, and you've
just been accepted at Harvard Law School? If you're awkward, insecure
and confused like Harper Stone, played by Sarah Polley ("The Sweet
Hereafter"), you run off with a passionate photographer more than
twice your age. Especially if he's a carefree, charming, ruggedly
attractive Irish bohemian like Stephen Rea ("The Crying Game"). But
Harper's not the first naive young girl he's seduced. No, there are a
bevy of "Guineveres," as he dubs them. But this is not the usual
May-September romance in which the worldly guy boosts his sagging ego
by recapturing his youth with an inexperienced girl - despite what
Harper's urbane mother (Jean Smart) says in a scathing, devastating,
accusatory encounter. Instead, it offers a sensitive insight into what
the nubile girl gets out of such a rite-of-passage relationship -
things like self-confidence, knowledge, and experience, even if the
mentor's an alcoholic. Writer Audrey Wells ("The Truth about Cats and
Dogs") makes her directing debut with this $2.6 million independent
feature that juxtaposes the formal elegance of snobbish Pacific
Heights with the impoverished yet exuberant existence of the grungy
inner city with its scruffy intellectual and artistic community. While
it's hard to take an aspiring photographer-who-never-takes-a-picture
seriously, the conclusion, which contrives to reunite the Guineveres,
seems too fanciful and out of context. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1
to 10, "Guinevere" is a fresh, vibrant and engaging 8, commanding
attention from start to finish.</P>
