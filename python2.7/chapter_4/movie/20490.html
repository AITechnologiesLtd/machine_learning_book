<PRE>What's Wrong With This Pitcher?
For Love of the Game</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Like New York's Yankee Fans, you might want to root against Kevin Costner as
Detroit Tigers' aging pitcher Billy Chapel in another silly love story at
the baseball diamond. And for the first couple of innings you'd have good
reason to heckle. But like the aching Chapel, "For Love of the Game" slowly
pulls itself out of a sluggish slump. Sliding in slow motion under your
skin, it gradually pulls you from that slouched near-sleep position to the
edge of the bleaches ... baited and waiting on that last pitch.</P>
<P>Unlike most sports films, this one starts rather promptly into the
proverbial "big game." His lover (Preston) bails, his owner sells the team,
and the next day after a sleepless night Chapel steps up to the mound in
what could very possibly be his last pro game. Such a hurried start leaves
the viewer wanting for traditional character setups; fear not, the bottom of
each inning provides ample time for reflection. These "flashbacks" bring you
up to speed on what looks like a possible no-hitter for a guy who throws for
the love of the game.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the film ends as it begins -- that last pitch is a fading
sinker (metaphorically speaking). Engaging and well directed in the middle,
but weak on beginning and end; Costner and Preston give outstanding
performances throughout. While it still hits above average, a different
climax may have made this a very fine film.</P>
<P>Save yourself a few bucks and quench your appetite for a good baseball love
story: rent "The Natural" with Robert Redford now and "For the Love of the
Game" around Christmas.</P>
