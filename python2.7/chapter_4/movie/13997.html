Review:        Lethal Weapon 4</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:        Mel Gibson/Danny Glover
                Renee Russo/Jet Li/Joe Pesci/Chris Rock</PRE>
<PRE>Reviewer:        Joy Wyse</PRE>
<P>If there is any doubt that this sequel is not up to the original, forget
it.  It's every bit as good, if not better.  There is no problem if you're
one of the few people who didn't see any of the first three movies.  You
easily learn who the characters are and how they relate to each other.  In
its own way Lethal Weapon 4 reminds me of the old "Road" movies, or the
Abbott and Costello series.  Each one is able to stand on its own, but you
know the characters and you feel that you were watching old friends.  In
this  episode there are two new figures to entertain us.  One, Jet Li, is
a thing of beauty to behold.  As the cool, controlled bad guy, he moves
with the grace of a ballet dancer but the malice of the deadly killer that
he is.  The other, Chris Rock, becomes a continuing character as the new
son-in-law of Murtagh [Danny Glover].  Chris, like Joe Pesci, utters most
of the foul language in the film.  Strangely, it becomes comical when
Pesci tries to talk without swearing so that he can be quoted on TV. </P>
<P>It is enjoyable  when seemingly unimportant scenes suddenly tie in and
become parts of the story.  If you catch them early enough, you have a
feeling of pride that you figured them out before they're explained.  
It's also great to be in on the joke, such as when Danny Glover thinks
that Chris Rock is gay, but we know that he is his son-in-law.</P>
<P>Although some of the stunts are highly improbable, they are nonetheless
entertaining.  By now, you've probably seen most of them on clips on TV. 
Even though you know that they are stunts and that everyone will survive,
they are still harrowing.  The fire is almost too real.</P>
<P>This is a very violent film with some stomach turning scenes.  The
garroting and the lancing made most adults grimace with pain.  As always,
there is plenty of humor surrounding the stars.  The chicken sequence is a
memorable on-running gag.  There are many, many moments that you keep
remembering.  That is the mark of a truly entertaining movie.  You keep
thinking about it.  I definitely want to see it again.</P>
<PRE>I give it a B.</PRE>
