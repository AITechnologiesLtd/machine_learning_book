<PRE>Halloween: H20
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Jamie Lee Curtis; Adam Arkin; Josh Hartnett; Michelle Williams &
Adam Hann-Byrd</P>
<P>Good old Michael Myers is back to instill his usual brand of terror on
Halloween night. Unlike the previous 2 dozen sequels (at least it seemed
like that many), this latest installment has some real actors involved. At
the head of that list is Jamie Lee Curtis who became a star after starring
in the first Halloween and its first sequel as Laurie Strode, Michael Myers'
sister and the object of his obsession. Of course obsession in Mike's case
means that he wants to kill her. Joining Curtis this time out are Adam Arkin
(from TV's Chicago Hope) and Michelle Williams (from TV's Dawson's Creek).
It must have seemed like a reunion of sorts for Michelle Williams, since the
executive producer of Dawson's Creek, Kevin Williamson, also had a hand in
the making of Halloween: H20. By now people are starting to realize that
Kevin Williamson's involvement in a movie tends to mean that a quality
project is going to appear on the screen. With such horror films as Scream,
Scream 2 and I Know What You Did Last Summer under his belt, Kevin
Williamson knows a little something about horror films. A fact that is
fairly evident in the latest Halloween movie. Gone are the plot less,
mindless, badly acted sequels on the past few years, Williamson and company
have managed to breathe new life into a very tired horror series that by
rights should have been killed off years ago. It's a credit to all of those
involved in H20 that it makes you remember just why the original is
considered to be the classic that it is today. And speaking of classics, no
review of H20 would be complete without the mentioning the inclusion of
Janet Leigh in a small but memorable role in H20. For those of you who are
less knowledgeable out there in movie land, Leigh starred in psycho and was
the one who ended taking that ill- fated shower at the Bates motel. She also
happens to be Jamie Lee Curtis' mother. I only mention this because most of
the fairly young audience that I screened the film with completely missed
the very clever psycho references that Leigh made.</P>
<P>Anyway, on to the plot. As everybody already knows, Michael Myers is the
masked knife wielding psycho who seems to be on a fairly relentless quest to
kill off all members of his family. (As a bit of trivia, the mask that Myers
wears is a William Shatner mask painted white. Which may explain all of the
bad acting in the past several sequels.) Although just how relentless that
murderous quest is seems to be questionable. This latest Halloween film
seems to ignore the events of the last 3 or 4 sequels where Myers has killed
off half of the Midwestern United States. It seems to suggest that Myers
hasn't been heard from since the events of the first two movies. But in
other ways it doesn't, since Curtis's character supposedly changed her name
and went into hiding sometime after the events of the first two movies --
giving way to explain why she wasn't around for the last 3 of these movies
when Myers was trying to slice and dice her daughter. At any rate, good old
Mike, after all these years has finally figured out where his sister Laurie
is and he is coming over for a family reunion. Since Laurie Strode and Mike
last exchanged pleasantries (in the form of Laurie blowing him up in
Halloween 2), Laurie has changed her name, and is a divorced mother of one
(which doesn't explain her daughter who Myers terrorized through Halloween 4
and 5) and she is a teacher at a private school in California. It seems that
the majority of the student body is going off on a little field trip that
will leave the gated campus largely deserted over the Halloween weekend.
Gosh, that's convenient. Also hanging out on the campus are Strode's son and
his girlfriend, as well as another young couple who are playing hookey from
the field trip. Oh yeah, uncle Mike shows up too, just in time to show off
his own brand of trick or treating. You can probably figure out the rest.
But lets just say that Jamie Lee Curtis shows us that even after twenty
years she can still take on masked killers with the best of them.</P>
<P>My complaints with this movie are small ones. Unlike the Scream films, the
characters in this movie don't appear to have watched that many horror
films, so as a result, when Myers appears wielding some large weapon, they
tend to be your typical dumb horror film characters. I.e. They run upstairs
as opposed to running out the front door. My next beef is the whole timeline
thing. While I understand that the producers would love to forget the last
few movies, it tends to be a bit confusing for those of us who actually sat
through all of them. (What can I say? I have no life.) I guess my biggest
disappointment was sadly one that could not have been prevented. Donald
Pleasance, the only bright spot in all of the Halloween films passed away
after the filming of the last Halloween movie, so Dr. Sam Loomis was not
around to save the day as he was in the earlier 6 films. Although as a sort
of tribute to him, they did use his voice in one of the opening scenes of
the film as they were recapping the Halloween story for those that may not
have seen Myers and company in twenty years.</P>
<P>The best Halloween since the original.</P>
