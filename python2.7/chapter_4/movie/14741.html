Susan Granger's review of "BELOVED" (Touchstone Pictures)</PRE>
<P>Leave it to the resourceful Oprah Winfrey to insure that at
least three, perhaps four, fine black actors will get Academy Award
nominations this year. In this adaptation of Toni Morrison's Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel about the devastating effects of slavery on an
African-American family, directed by Jonathan Demme ("Philadelphia"),
Oprah personifies terror and truth as Sethe, a former slave raising
her teenage daughter (Kimberly Elise) in rural Ohio circa 1873. She's
haunted by the horrors of her past and the ghost of her murdered baby,
plus the way the rest of her family (husband, two sons) have abandoned
her. After drifting around since emancipation, another former slave
(Danny Glover) shows up on her doorstep. They share a common
birthplace: a plantation called Sweet Home in Kentucky - except "It
wasn't sweet and it wasn't home." Then a strange, wild young woman
(Thandie Newton) appears. Covered with slime and filth, and talking
like the devil in "The Exorcist," she says her name is "Beloved."
Gradually, through flashbacks, the tortuous, interweaving background
story of these characters evolves. Like "Amistad" and "Rosewood," it
reveals the terrible truth about black history, prejudice, and man's
inhumanity to man. Unlike "The Color Purple," however, the audience is
kept emotionally distant.  Perhaps that's because the serious,
intelligent and deeply disturbing script is an assemblage of three
writers: Akosua Busia (soon-to-be ex-wife of director John Singleton),
Richard LaGravenese ("Bridges of Madison County"), and Adam Brooks
("French Kiss"). On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Beloved" is a
stately, artistically admirable 9 - but recommended only for those who
are willing to undergo three long, stolid hours of unrelenting misery.</P>
