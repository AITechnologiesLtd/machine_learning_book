<PRE>Azat Badretdinov, Ph.D.</PRE>
<P>New Hollywood product The Siege started this weekend in many theaters
across the USA. The plot of this movie, as well as several other
Hollywood movies (i.e. True Lies), is based on the issue of Arabic
terrorism. Because of the trend in American industry to depict Arabs as
fanatic terrorists, this movie received negative evaluation from several
Muslim and non-Muslim American Organizations, which called up to boycott
this movie. In order to decide myself I went to see The Siege last Saturday
afternoon.</P>
<PRE>Review.</PRE>
<P>First scenes took place somewhere in the Middle East in the desert with
violent CIA kidnapping of a sheik (presumably a leader of one of the Arabic
guerilla groups). After that action is transfered to New York City and
stays there for the rest of the movie.</P>
<P>Main characters include ?main-good-guy? - one of FBI chief officers (Denzel
Washington), ?controversial-but-good-guy-must-die-in-the-end? - CIA
operational officer (Annette Bening), ?main-bad-guy-must-die-in-the-end? -
her lover Palestinian fighter Sarik, ?auxilliary-good-guy? -
Lebanese-American FBI officer (Tony Shalhoub), ?stupid-good-guy? - army
general (Bruce Willis, who degraded now to supporting character roles). Most
of the time those characters verbally confront each other delivering standard
Hollywood dialog lines with a slight percentage of action montage which was
shot at a technical level somewhere between shooting the train of Lumiere
brothers and Soviet action movies.</P>
<P>First New-York based scene - Arabic-sounding music over panoramic view
of Manhattan canyons - leaves the audience in a quite a dismay. It is
strange  because, as we all know, and as it is also shown later in the movie,
Muslim Middle East population in New-York City is mainly Brooklyn-based.
Muslims of  Manhattan live in Harlem and South Bronx, belong mainly to the
Nation of Islam and have nothing to do with either Sunnis or Shiah or ?Arabic
terrorism?.</P>
<P>Then follows quite standard Hollywood disaster escalation: warning
bombing with the blue paint in the bus (there is quite elaborated and
plain stupid discussion why the paint is blue and not green) - explosion
of a city bus in Brooklyn - Broadway movie theater (where was a police,
which should be immediately mobilized to control all the public places)
- FBI building in New York City (certainly not a landmark, because it is
first time I heard of it).</P>
<P>The standard Hollywood trick - FBI vs CIA - is developed in this movie
ad absurdum - during whole movie the main obstacle in the investigation
is not a sophistication of terrorist conspiracy, but a stupid
opportunism of the CIA officer who is covering her lover - Palestinian
guy, sponsoring J-1 visas (which is simply impossible - by rules of INS
there should be an ORGANIZATION sponsoring them) used later by
terrorists.</P>
<P>Just note - this naive CIA officer sponsored a suicide-terrorist - who was
never arrested (except brief detention) not only in the first half of the
movie, but even when the whole Muslim Middle East population was apprehended
and incarcerated to a stadium (it is quite strange that in the following
demonstrations there were no participating Yankee fans demanding their
stadium back). High-ranked FBI agent could not save his son from detention,
but CIA agent could hide her lover - clue figure in investigation as every
character in the movie knows - until the very end of the movie!</P>
<P>The depiction of ?main-bad-guy? is plain stupid. I never saw such a bad
actor in major Hollywood movie. Besides the fact that he drinks wine (is
not he supposed to be a Muslim fanatic?) with his CIA lover, his face
knows only one very artificially looking expression of self-confident
arrogance and the lines he delivers is always plain political message.</P>
<P>Poor Annette Bening (?controversial-but-good-guy-must-die-in-the-end?)! The
supporting stuff of the movie had really bent over to mutilate her face,
haircut and clothes. They made her so disgusting, that I refuse completely to
understand why all the good and bad guys in the movie are so sexually
attracted to her. Is it a new kind of perversion to fall in love with a woman
dressed like a bum? The only explanation I have is that the director was
afraid that people will cry rivers of tears when she dies in the end. Well,
he certainly overshot - her death left the audience absolutely unemotional
(probably, because of the strange twist in director's mind - he decided that
the last words she should say should be 'inshallah' - which means 'if God
will permit', which is by itself has nothing to do with the situation and it
is strange for a CIA officer so fluent in Arabic).</P>
<P>There were quite a few moments that made the audience to react - a
couple of ordinary jokes made by Lebanese FBIer caused a couple of
laughing bursts in the audience. In the dull boring landscape of the
movie a joke comparing the radiotracking to a microwave should really
look like a gem.</P>
<P>Summarizing, this movie is very weak even at Hollywood standards. I
would disagree with both views: that The Siege is against
white-and-black view of Muslims (as the creators claim) and that it
hurts Muslims (as Muslim groups claim) simply because it is so vanilla stupid
that I am really surprised that it made $14M during its first weekend.</P>
<P>Indeed, American audience is attracted by bad reviews like a naive teenager is
attracted to bad guys.</P>
<P>P.S. There was a moment that touched me personally only in the evening when I
returned home. During Al-Fatiha (most favourite and popular Muslim prayer) I
suddenly remembered with sheer poignancy one moment in the movie - when the
only apprehended member of one of the terrorist groups (about half a dozen of
other ?bad guys? died during suicide explosions, massive killing in a gas
station and in the Brooklyn apartment) was delivering the same words that
every Muslim pronounces at least 10 times a day. He said ?[Allah], lead us by
the straight path, not the path of those who went astray? just before he was
brutally tortured, killed and sent to heaven by USA army general (Bruce
Willis). Since this guy appeared only first time in this movie, apparently he
was punished for praying.</P>
