<P>Richard Brinsley Sheridan's play "The Rivals"  opened in London in 
1775  and  introduced the now famous character of Mrs. Malaprop. The 
most recent, non-fictitious characters in the USA to cause mirth by 
mangling the English language include Dan Quayle and George W. Bush, 
but they can't hold a candle (or is it a flashlight?) to the 
character of  Chicagoan Trixie Zurbo, played by  London-born  Emily 
Watson of justified fame for her parts in "Breaking the Waves," 
"Hillary and Jackie " and other recent movies, plus British stage and 
TV.</P>
<P>She is 33 but looks like a recent teenager. She has no education to 
speak of,  she  chews gum incessantly. Her brother was a cop killed 
in the line of duty, so, perhaps for this reason, she has opted for 
being a security guard. But soon she goes to work as a plainclothes 
sleuth in a small casino, where she is on the lookout for thieves and 
such. She refers to herself as a "private defective." Which brings us 
to the real uniqueness of Dixie. Her speech is peppered, salted with, 
and in fact drowning in,  malapropisms. In this respect she is the 
undeniable gold medalist of twisted language, the paramount killer of 
English, the Lady Executioner of metaphors  and figures of speech..</P>
<P>"My sister is expecting a baby, but I don't know if I'll be an uncle 
or an aunt." "I won't let you drink yourself to Bolivian." "Fish or 
get off the pot." "He smokes like a fish." "A Parasite for sore 
eyes." "To grab the bull by the tail." "Do I have an ace up my hole?" 
"Getting your quarry by hook or ladder." "I wouldn't eat a steak if 
it came on a ten-foot pole." " "It's time to swallow the bullet." 
"Even if I am between a hard rock and the deep blue sea."  " I want 
to go back to square zero." And so on ad nauseam and absurdum.</P>
<P>This fractured English,  like a germ  is caught by other characters 
who say things like: "If I want your opinion, I'll give it to you." 
"The sword of Damocles is hanging over Pandora's box." "I make no 
bones, except this one," "Hypocrisy, not Democracy."</P>
<P>Writer-director Alan Rudolph has been an independent  with a maverick 
style since 1973. His nearly 20  films are a mixed bag, with some 
among those he was able to write and direct --as opposed to having to 
hire out to others as a director--having a nice following, notably 
"Remember my Name" (1978) and "Choose Me," (1984).  More recently 
"Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle" (1994)  (about Dorothy Parker 
and the Algonquin Round Table ) was exceptionally good,. wonderfully 
acted... and criminally neglected. "Afterglow" (1997) with Julie 
Christie and Nick Nolte, was quirkily interesting, but never got the 
public it deserved. The 1999 "Breakfast of Champions" bombed, with 
good reason.</P>
<P>Rudolph must have made a huge collection of malapropisms, and only 
then decided to build a plot around them. It centers around Trixie, 
her new, low-life boyfriend Dex,  shady operator Red, underage bimbo 
Ruby (Dex's ex, with a son by him), overage bimbo Dawn (but Lesley 
Ann Warren is quite attractive), shady Senator Avery,  friendly 
casino-performer Kirk, and other characters. They are invariably un- 
or ill-defined.</P>
<P>The plot somehow involves a murder, a mystery, sleuthing, politics 
and action, all of which make no sense, most of which are 
impenetrable, and the sum of which results in two painful hours of 
viewing. There is no single believable character around. Trixie is a 
dimwit. The crooked, hard-drinking and deep down stupid  senator's 
speeches may interest those who listen to them or read them in the 
media, because they are an assembly of actual politicos' speeches, 
with a healthy amount of Newt Gingrich quotes. As TRixie might spell 
it, it's a "hair-brained" movie all the way.</P>
<P>Rudolph was ever championed by critic Pauline Kael and the protege of 
director Robert Altman. The latter produced some of the films, 
including  "Trixie" which Rudolph calls ":a screwball noir." But 
then, just as  that hyenas think that their little ones are 
beautiful, Mr. Rudolph may be alone in thinking that the movie is 
what he says it is. In reality, it's such a mess. that it qualifies 
Rudolph as a red-faced film-maker.</P>
