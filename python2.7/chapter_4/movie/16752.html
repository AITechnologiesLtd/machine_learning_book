<PRE>THE HARMONISTS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Based on the true story of a singing troupe called the "Comedian
Harmonists," THE HARMONISTS starts in Berlin in the late 1920s.
Unemployment is soaring with 3 million out of work, but a failed actor
with a vision, Harry Frommermann, decides his future lies as a musical
"arranger," and singer.  Ulrich Noethen, who looks like LIFE IS
BEAUTIFUL's Roberto Benigni, plays Harry, who hires 4 other singers and
a pianist.  Together they will sing a high-pitched, 5-part harmony.
Their innocent, happy tunes will later prove somewhat of an antidote to
the terror that will grip the nation as the Nazis come to power.</P>
<P>With Joseph Vilsmaier's warm and radiant cinematography and Rolf
Zehetbauer's handsome period sets, post-World War I Germany looks lovely
and inviting.  The relatively light-hearted story is structured into 3
parts.  The first concerns the trials and tribulations of the group's
formation, the second has them living in the lap of luxury, and the
final act covers the oppression they faced because some of them were
Jewish.</P>
<P>Harry's vision, based on the popularity of The Revelers, was for the
group to sing as one, with no individual standing out.  Their memorable
songs are of a type that most of you may not have heard before.  The
lyrics are childlike and silly with occasional and obscure
double-entendre -- one such double-entendre mentions "sprouting
asparagus," for example.  Told you, they were obscure.</P>
<P>The movie's best scenes are its simplest.  One especially charming one
has the group at an impromptu jam session, in which they do an
instrumental blues song with their voices as the instruments.  Their
talents as singers are never in doubt even if their type of music may no
longer have the universal appeal it did then.</P>
<P>The long middle section of the movie has them, along with their
girlfriends, wives, and one-night-stands, living like kings in the best
hotels in Europe -- their rapid rise to musical stardom being roughly
akin to that of the Beatles.  Overwhelmed by their wealth and fame, one
of them remarks propitiously, "My God, what will happen next?"  He was
thinking positively, but the storm clouds were brewing on the continent</P>
<P>At first the group is just harassed as "sissies," but later the same
brash, young men don brown shirts and begin to torture and terrorize
anyone they don't like and they especially do not like Jews.  With their
millions of fans, the Comedian Harmonists figure, naively, that they
will be immune from the anti-Semitism rampant in the land.</P>
<P>The movie, which walks a fine line during the first two acts between
light musical comedy and history, commits itself in the somber last act
to being a message movie.  This last, schmaltzy part is where the film
begins to fall apart.  Carefree entertainment doesn't switch easily into
serious melodrama.  Try as it will, the movie just isn't able to shift
gears properly, despite its good intentions.  The result is an
enjoyable, historical story with a ponderous and sappy SOUND OF
MUSIC-style ending.  Whatever you do, don't leave before the epilogue
that reveals what happened to the members of the group as well as to
their spouses and lovers.</P>
<P>THE HARMONISTS runs 1:55..  The film is in German with English
subtitles.  It is not rated but would be an R for brief nudity,
sexuality, drug usage and mature themes and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
