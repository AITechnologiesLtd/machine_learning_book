<PRE>                                   INSIDE
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     Famous director Arthur Penn (BONNIE AND CLYDE) turns his attention
to apartheid in the claustrophobic new film INSIDE.  Set in 1988 toward
the end of the apartheid era, the film is an earnest and well
intentioned story of the horrors of imprisonment during South Africa's
racist regime.</P>
<P>     Pedantic and preachy, Penn's film tries to be an almost
unwatchably horrific picture and succeeds.  It has a single point,
which is the brutality common during that period.  Penn has given us a
highly repetitious movie, which in the first ten minutes chillingly
illustrates South Africa's violent inhumanity and then forces the
viewer to endure similar scenes again and again.</P>
<P>     Hard to watch shows can be effective, the best recent example
being PARADISE LOST: THE CHILD MURDERS AT ROBIN HOOD HILLS.  Although
PARADISE LOST almost made me feel ill, it was enlightening and never
manipulative.  INSIDE is an in-your-face movie that flaunts the
atrocities.  Hopefully, most viewers by now realize the despicable acts
of the South African government.  For those who do not the first ten
minutes of the film will provide an education.  The rest of the picture
relies on shock value and misses a golden opportunity to teach us more.</P>
<P>     A fictional, but quite believable screenplay by Bima Stag, centers
around the imprisonment of University professor Marty Strydom, played
with frightening realism by Eric Stoltz.  His chief interrogator in the
Kafkaesque drama is a Colonel Kruger, played by Nigel Hawthorne in a
performance reminiscent of Ralph Fiennes's work as the smiling Nazi in
SCHINDLER'S LIST.  The Colonel explains to the professor that, "We are
phasing out apartheid, but these things take time."</P>
<P>     Professor Strydom is arrested under the Security Act which permits
people suspected of a broad group of crimes, including terrorism, to be
jailed without charge for up to six months.  It appears that the
professor may have hidden guns and bombs for a friend of his involved
in terrorist activities, but Strydom refuses to talk.  He is beaten
senseless on a daily basis to encourage him to confess his crimes.</P>
<P>     Although the guards are played by South Africans with heavy
accents, Stoltz's accent is jarringly bad.  Perhaps they should have
rewritten his part so that he was an American professor teaching in
South Africa.</P>
<P>     Much of the problems in the show stem from the script's obsession
with the prison cell as the venue from which to tell the story and from
Jan Weincke's camera angles.  Long sequences are shot from the outside
of the cell with the door's two inch peephole filled with a prisoner's
mouth.  These talking lips cover the entire movie screen for minutes at
a time.  Other shots are taken from the ceiling level shooting down
onto Strydom curled up in a fetal position in the corner of his tiny
cell.</P>
<P>     Although the performances are excellent and easy to empathize
with, they suffer through the repetition.  Periodically, the narrative
starts to take off in flashforwards to the present and the Colonel's
own interrogation by an ex-prisoner and now a government official
played by Louis Gossett Jr.  These scenes hold real potential to
provide a counterpoint and meaning to the film, but Penn is obsessed
with making sure that the audience spends most of its time in prison.
The film's title was not chosen casually.</P>
<P>     The script uses language to outrage the viewers.  "Apartheid was
not about race," the Colonel tells his accuser.  "It was about culture.
The Stone Age can't coexist with the Twentieth Century."</P>
<P>     It also uses some gruesome images to arouse the audience's anger.
In a show full of brutality, perhaps the worst incident shows a
prisoner being flung repeatedly against the peephole into Strydom's
cell.  The man's blood and pieces of his flesh come flying in.</P>
<P>     The otherwise completely plausible story concludes with an
emotionally effective, but unrealistic scene.  Overall, the film is
efficaciously terrifying, but little more.  There are many other and
better films that cover the same ground as INSIDE.  I left knowing
little more than when I entered the screening.  A lost opportunity.</P>
<P>     In the press kit, Stoltz talks about the freedom that Arthur Penn
gave the actors in INSIDE.  Stoltz says proudly, "He hardly gives you
any direction."  Therein, perhaps, lies the problem.</P>
<P>     INSIDE runs 1:34, but it feels twice that long.  It is rated R for
violence, torture, language, and a brief sex scene.  It is appropriate
for teenagers only if they are quite mature and not susceptible to
nightmares.  I admired all of the acting and I think the message of the
film is important, but the show itself is almost unwatchable.  I give
it a marginal thumbs down and **.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
