<PRE>                                THE SHADOW
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Alec Baldwin, John Lone, Penelope Ann Miller.
Screenplay:  David Koepp.
Director:  Russell Mulcahy.</P>
<P>     When it comes to action hero chic in the 90's, bleak is
beautiful.  BATMAN, of course, set the course with its Gothic Gotham
and tortured Dark Knight, and later films such as THE CROW have
attempted to capture the same moody atmosphere.  The latest challenger
for that murky throne is THE SHADOW, based on the radio character of
the 1930's and 1940's ... well, not much of a challenger, actually.
THE SHADOW is the kind of film that makes others in the genre look
better by comparison.  Warts and all, BATMAN and THE CROW were at least
consistent in their tone; THE SHADOW is messy, convoluted and plodding,
the work of a director without an ounce of vision.</P>
<P>     Alec Baldwin stars as Lamont Cranston, who as the film opens is a
brutal warlord in China.  After an encounter with a mysterious holy
man, Cranston renounces his evil ways, returning to New York with the
power to cloud men's minds and a new alter-ego--The Shadow.  While he
is successful dealing with petty hoods, Cranston discovers a bigger
threat on the horizon.  That threat is Shiwan Khan (John Lone), only
living descendent of Genghis Khan and a man with powers similar to The
Shadow's.  When Khan manipulates a government scientist (Ian McKellen)
to achieve his aims, the scientist's daughter Margo (Penelope Ann
Miller) joins The Shadow's team of operatives in an attempt to save New
York from the world's first atomic bomb.</P>
<P>     Director Russell Mulcahy's last film was the execrable Kim
Basinger exercise THE REAL McCOY, and if THE SHADOW proves anything it
is that Mulcahy hasn't learned much about pacing since then.  For an
adventure film, THE SHADOW moves like a truck through mud.  There is
promise through the film's opening fifteen minutes, as Mulcahy takes
advantage of some nifty special effects to make The Shadow's first
showdown with bad guys brisk and effective.  Then, just as quickly, THE
SHADOW slams into a wall (or maybe one of the many laughably bad matte
paintings which fill the film).  There is no tension or excitement to
any of The Shadow's confrontations with Shiwan Khan or his henchmen,
and the dialogue is lacking in any real wit.  When we see that
screenwriter David Koepp (JURASSIC PARK) has set the climactic scene
between The Shadow and Khan in a hall of mirrors, we see how truly
lacking in creativity was any aspect of THE SHADOW's production.</P>
<P>     It also appears that Koepp and Mulcahy couldn't agree as to
whether they were making a dark tone-y picture a la BATMAN or a more
traditional comic book adventure closer to THE ROCKETEER.  Like Batman,
The Shadow is a character with a dark side, and Koepp seems to want to
keep that dark side in focus.  But then, just when the tone seems
clear, Mulcahy will whip out an egregious crane shot or, in one of the
most pointless exercises in whiz-bang photography in recent memory,
follow a message through miles of pneumatic tubing.  Perhaps one of the
reasons THE SHADOW feels so stagnant is that writer and director are
pulling so hard from opposite ends that it ends up going nowhere.</P>
<P>     That confusion wastes the fine casting of Alec Baldwin in the
title role.  With his low, intense rasp, Baldwin has the perfect voice,
and his piercing eyes glow behind The Shadow's scarf.  Unfortunately,
he gets virtually no supporting help.  John Lone is much too low-key as
Khan, and doesn't seem to realize what a villain has to be in a film
like THE SHADOW, namely charismatic.  Penelope Ann Miller is once again
nothing but eye candy, perhaps the only actress on the planet who makes
Kim Basinger look talented.  Tim Curry literally froths at the mouth as
one of Khan's toadies, and poor Ian McKellen slums through his stock
absent-minded professor part.  When it comes right down to it, very
little in THE SHADOW works, because no one involved seemed to have
anything interesting to say or present visually.  Here's hoping that
Universal's marketing department doesn't have the power to cloud too
many minds into spending money on this one.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 clouded minds:  3.</PRE>
