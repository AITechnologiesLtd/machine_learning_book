<PRE>                             THE DEVIL'S OWN
                       A film review by Paul Miller
                        Copyright 1997 Paul Miller</PRE>
<P>This is definately a movie that has been through a lot even though it
just started out at the box office just 2 days ago.  Brad Pitt publicly
denouced the film because of its numerous script rewrites and plot
changes.  Well, in the end ....</P>
<P>The Devil's Own starts with Frankie (Pitt) as a small boy.  A mysterious
masked man enters, shoots his father, then leaves.  Flash ahead to 1992.
Apparatly Frankie is now IRA.  He has vowed to revenge his fathers death
by killing as many British army members as possible.  One problem, it
seems that every british soldier is after him now.</P>
<P>He leaves to go to the US.  A judge (I believe that the judge had IRA
ties although they never really say) hooks Frankie now called Rory up
with a NY police officer (Harrison Ford).  He finds something that leads
directly into Frankie past....</P>
<P>Anyway, you want more details...pay $5 and go see the movie.  I did.</P>
<P>Nonetheless, the movie starts out very slowly once we leaves Ireland but
picks up in not too long.  I think however, they could've done more with
the background between Frankie and the judge because you never really
understand that, you just know that they are together in some way.  I
also think that more could've been done with the relationship between
Frankie and the women (her name escapes me....).</P>
<P>I still liked the movie and am glad I went to see it, but it still
could've been better.</P>
