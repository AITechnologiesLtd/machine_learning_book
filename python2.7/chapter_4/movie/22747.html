Film Criticism By Zachary McGhee</PRE>
<P>Not Rated (strong language, mild violence, mature themes), 90 minutes, 1998.
Released commercially in 2000. Justin Lakes, Ryan Daugherty, Jon Daugherty.
Directed by Julian Goldberg.</P>
<P>Movies like Trans get on my nerves. They’re the type of rubbish that makes up
roughly one-half of the independent film world, and give it a bad name. The
other half are grand motion pictures carried out in the traditions of cinema:
Bright, original, cutting edge. We, as critics, may urge Hollywood studios to
take a look at this emerging art form known as independent film, but imagine a
film like this slips through the cracks and they get a good look at it?</P>
<P>Even Supernova, a recent film which looks pretty much like a disaster area with
its background (that film’s director walked out in an editing dispute with
the studio and replaced his name with pseudonym Thomas Lee) and pathetic
screenplay, is preferable to this mediocre, muddled garbage. Few directors can
achieve the feat which Julian Goldberg has. This movie is boring, long, drawn
out and unnecessary. If you don’t have a story to tell, don’t tell it.</P>
<P>Truth be told, the most horrible and condemning fact about Trans is this: I
walked out of this movie.</P>
<P>The plot (which I had to look up on the Internet, as it can’t be found in the
film itself) seems to go something like this: A young delinquent of some sort
manages to escape the juvenile facility he’s been placed in and goes running
all around talking and meeting with different people who manage to assist in
concealing him from authorities out to catch him, along the way somehow
managing to be called by some a "coming-of-age" tale.</P>
<P>Sundance officials, who selected the film to run at the 1999 festival, say that
they were "so excited" when they saw Trans. No doubt because, if there were any
insomniacs among them, they were instantly cured. I was constantly checking my
watch during the movie, and when it felt as if the film ought to be reaching
some sort of merciful conclusion, I realized that only one-third of it had
passed, leaving another sixty minutes to be endured. And so I up and left.</P>
<P>I give Trans one star, rather than none, because perhaps I did not give it
enough of a chance, and maybe if I had seen the rest of it there might have
been some redeeming qualities about it. Of course, a film with a prologue as
tedious, incoherent and confused as this one hardly deserves such a
presumptuous credit.</P>
<P>Sundance officials also noted that the visual integrity of Trans appealed to
them, and the fact that Goldberg didn’t really know "where he wanted to go"
when he started shooting somehow makes the film more true to life in its art.
Ha. I say, you don’t know where you’re going when you start shooting?
You’re wasting film.</P>
<P>But then, that can be forgiven. If you know where you want to go when you start
editing. Chop out the tedium. That is, of course, unless there’s nothing but
that.</P>
