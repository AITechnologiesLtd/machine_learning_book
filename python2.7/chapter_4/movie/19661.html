<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Disney's live-action big-screen version of the popular animated
television series, while likely be entertaining for kids, will be a bore
for those who have reached a double-digit age.  Giving the lead role to
Matthew Broderick could be part of the problem – Gadget should be
bumbling and cocky, not bumbling and bland.</P>
<P>Broderick (Godzilla) stars as John Brown, a security guard for a
scientific research facility and a wannabe cop.  He is also in love with
Brenda (Joely Fisher, TV's Ellen), the daughter of a scientist that is
on the brink of creating robot police officers.  When a late-night
break-in attempt leaves her dad dead and John clinging to life, Brenda
decides to have doctors remove John's innards and replace them with the
lifework of her father.  The result?  John Brown becomes Inspector
Gadget, a high-tech officer for the Riverton Police Department.  Gadget
can implement any of his new features by shouting `Go Go Gadget,'
followed by whatever it is he wants to use – like spring legs or
helicopter hat.  But, like the series, he usually gets it wrong,
hilarity ensues, yet he still manages to get the bad guy.</P>
<P>Speaking of bad guys, Gadget's nemesis Claw is hammily played by Rupert
Everett (An Ideal Husband).  The world's youngest (and formerly the
fattest) billionaire, he has both an evil cackle and a net worth counter
on the front of his desk.  He's the one responsible for the break-in and
was left with a crushed right hand, which is eventually replaced with
the claw from which he derives his moniker.  Claw's headquarters are
located within the same Pittsburgh building that was supposed to have
been used to house Brainiac in the stalled production of Superman.</P>
<P>Like the TV series, Gadget has a dog named Brain and a niece named Penny
(Michelle Trachtenberg, Harriet the Spy), both of which appear smarter
than him.  Like the TV series, Gadget also has a talking car, voiced
here by D.L. Hughley (The Hughleys), who breathes some much-needed
energy into the film.  And like the TV series, Gadget always gets his
man and delivers him to Police Chief Quimby (Dabney Coleman, You've Got
Mail).  Other characters include a wasted (probably literally) Andy Dick
(NewsRadio) as one of Claw's scientists and an annoying Cheri Oteri
(Saturday Night Live) as Riverton's Mayor.</P>
<P>Perhaps even odder than the casting of Broderick is Disney's selection
of director David Kellogg, whose only previous effort was Playboy's
Playmates at Play video release.  This could explain the scene where
Gadget hoses down a cleavage-bearing Fisher with a giant load of blue
toothpaste.  Also, be on the lookout for several bothersome product
placement scenes.  (1:36 - PG for wacky violence/action, language and
innuendo)</P>
