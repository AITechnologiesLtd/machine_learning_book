<PRE>The Haunting (1963)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 70</PRE>
<P>One of the better haunted house films, "The Haunting"
conveys horror without resorting to violence,
gore, or even special effects.  No ghosts ever
appear onscreen, but we know they are out there,
howling, laughing and banging, in the hallway behind
the door.  And the doorknob is turning!</P>
<P>A cerebral British adaption of the Shirley Jackson
novel, "The Haunting" takes place (naturally) in a
large, foreboding New England mansion with a
history of death and terror.  Psychic researcher
Dr. Markway (Richard Johnson) arrives to prove
the existence of the supernatural, bringing with
him nervous, impressionable Eleanor (Julie Harris),
psychic lesbian Theodora (Claire Bloom), and
cynical Russ Tamblyn, who is heir to the mansion.</P>
<P>What I liked best about "The Haunting" wasn't the
ghost scenes, which promise more than they deliver.
I liked the characters, who behave with consistency
and are well developed.  Markway is torn by conflicting
motives: he wants to study Hill House, but is also
protective of his inexperienced team members.  Theodora
is icy cool and predatory, helping to drive hapless
Eleanor over the edge.  Julie Harris is one of my
favorite actresses, and she plays her bundle of nerves
character without making her overly sympathetic.
Nonbeliever Tamblyn considers his adventure in
Hill House to be one big joke, until... well, you'll
have to see it.</P>
<P>The biggest weakness of "The Haunting" is that
it teases the audience with the presence of ghosts
without ever revealing them.  Why not have the door
fly open, and have an enormous green ghost sweep
around the panic-stricken guests, swirling books
and chairs?  Subtlety is all well and good, but the
film's climax can still be a real horror show.</P>
