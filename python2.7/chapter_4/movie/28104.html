3000 Miles to Graceland
A movie review by Joe Barlow
Copyright 2001</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING:  Kurt Russell, Kevin Costner, David Arquette,
           Ice T, Courtney Cox
DIRECTOR:  Demian Lichtenstein
WRITERS:   Richard Recco and Demian Lichtenstein
RATED:     R</PRE>
<P>Elvis is dead, and it would be damned kind of us to leave him that
way--especially when the vehicle for his return to the public eye is an
uninspired façade of a narrative like this.  Demian Lichtenstein's 3000
MILES TO GRACELAND is the latest cinematic offering to rape our collective
past, cheerfully exploiting American nostalgia and pillaging the icons of
an earlier, less jaded generation.  There's nothing wrong with satirizing
our heritage when it's done well--just take a look at the brilliant
PLEASANTVILLE, for instance--but this film feels less like homage than a
cheap attempt to whore our cultural icons for a quick buck.  May that be
all this film earns at the box office.</P>
<P>The story centers around a group of hard-nosed thieves who rob a
casino while dressed as Elvis impersonators.  All the film's main
characters are lifted wholesale from the Hollywood Book of Requisite
Action-Movie Stereotypes, including the gang's two ringleaders (Kurt
Russell and Kevin Costner), whose inability to agree on the best way to
divvy up the loot results in one stale argument scene after another; a
shallow single mother (played with no stretch whatsoever by Courtney Cox,
whose performance here equals the dramatic range she displayed in Bruce
Springsteen's "Dancing in the Dark" music video); and an army of
ever-expendable secondary characters, who exist here only to bring some
name recognition to the project.  (Ice T?  In an Elvis movie?  Well, thank
yuh.  Thank yuh very much.)</P>
<P>The film's trailer would have you believe that the majority of the tale
revolves around the planning and execution of the robbery, but don't be
fooled--the meat of the story centers more on the aftermath of the heist
than the crime itself, which is over and done with in the opening five
minutes.  Unfortunately, the first warning signs of the movie's dearth of
quality are apparent before this bullet ballet is over.  Lichtenstein,
attempting to disguise the film's disastrously uneven editing, takes every
opportunity to flaunt his music video roots at us--the two gunfights which
bookend the movie are constructed with quick jump cuts and needlessly
"flashy" camera shots that would be far more at home on MTV than in a film
aspiring to tell a coherent story.  The poor filmmaker, helming his second
feature film with 3000 MILES, doesn't yet seem to have a grasp on good
narrative storytelling technique, choosing instead to obfuscate the plot
behind stylistic editing and underwhelming camera moves that add nothing
but length to the final film.</P>
<P>But as tedious as the opening bloodbath is, things only get worse after
our merry band of nitwits hits the highway.  As you might expect, 3000
MILES TO GRACELAND is, in fact, a road movie about a trip to... Canada?
Yes, you read that correctly.  Canada.  But despite the fact that
Graceland plays no part in the film itself, its spirit does sort of hover
over the movie--a sad, disheveled icon that once had meaning, but now rots
away like so many peanut butter and 'nana sandwiches left out in the rain.
(Rather like Presley himself, at the hands of this movie.  It's sad that
Elvis, arguably the first true Sugar Daddy of rock and roll--and I'm
talking *lots* of sugar, sweet'pea--has been forced to "pseudo-star"
posthumously in this banal tale of crime, guns, and Elvis impersonators,
which serves less as a cohesive narrative than a barometer of pain.  This
is not the first film to ever feature Elvis impersonators as an integral
part of the plot, but it's unquestionably the worst.)</P>
<P>The cast is populated by a group of Hollywood A-list actors, all of whom
should have known better.  Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner get the king's
share (no pun intended) of screen time, and therefore deserve the complete
career derailments that are likely to occur after John P. Consumer gets an
eyeful of this garbage.  This is particularly disappointing--and
surprising--since Russell drew critical accolades for his performance of
Elvis in John Carpenter's 1979 TV miniseries; as such, it's lamentable
that he comes across so ham-fisted this time around--not so much
incompetent as begging for attention.</P>
<P>And sadly, Kevin Costner proves that the dramatic rebound I thought I'd
glimpsed in the recent THIRTEEN DAYS is nothing more than a passing fluke.
In 3000 MILES, Costner's performance as Dances with Whoppers (his
character is actually named Murphy, but admit it, you like my idea better)
comes across not so much as an effective villain but a reluctant actor;
I've heard of phoning in a role before, but Costner here doesn't even seem
to have the coins needed to place the call.  With starring roles in such
recent cinematic disasters as WATERWORLD and THE POSTMAN under his belt,
Kevin Costner proves one thing in 3000 MILES: he has the worst agent in
the known universe.</P>
<P>So, is there *anything* positive I can say about this film?  <Joe thinks
very, very hard.>  Well, I guess the cars were kinda cool.  And I suppose
that there are moments in 3000 MILES TO GRACELAND that manage to capture
the gritty excitement of being out on the road, with the dust flying up
around your car while the approved soundtrack of rebellion--rock and
roll--explodes from your speakers.  But with this material's painfully
inept handling, it might have been better if the film had choked on that
dust instead of cruising into theaters.</P>
