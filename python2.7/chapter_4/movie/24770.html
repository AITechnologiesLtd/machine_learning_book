<P>Saving Grace
Starring Brenda Blethyn and Craig Ferguson
Screenplay by Craig Ferguson and Mark Crowdy; story by Crowdy
Directed by Nigel Cole</P>
<PRE>IN SHORT: Stone cold funny.</PRE>
<P>Another death in a small British town story, complete with a Steve
Harley song in the soundtrack, is Saving Grace. This film, which proves
that "intelligent dope humor" is not an oxymoron, is co-scripted by star
Craig Ferguson of the Drew Carey Show, who did a similar turn on The Big
Tease earlier in the year. This one is much funnier and allows us Yanks
to see a much lighter side of twice Oscar nominated actress Brenda
Blethyn. It also maintains a streak of small Brit films that, like
Waking Ned Devine and The Full Monty, are gangbusters comedy and sweet
as fine chocolate.</P>
<P>The talk in the town of Cornwall is that Grace Trevathan's husband was
looking for the loo when he stepped out the door of a plane and
plummeted ten thousand feet or so to his death. It matters not to Grace
(Blethyn), who has spent the last thirty or so years in her greenhouse,
cultivating hybrid flowers. After hubby shuffles off, the dear widow
discovers that her old man had mortgaged the house and all their assets
up the wazoo, leaving her half a million dollars (give or take) in debt.
With a minimum monthly nut of £2000 to meet -- and we haven't even
gotten to what the greedy banker in London wants -- this poor woman,
who's never worked a day in her life finds herself involving her
gardener Matthew (Ferguson), who also has never worked a day in his
life, in a very illegal scheme.</P>
<P>Y'see, Matthew has a small stash of hemp plants out behind the local RC
church which provides a poor quality smoke for the local bartender and
doctor and friends. But winter is coming in and his plants are getting
sick and he asks the best plant person he knows, Grace, for help. Grace
recognizes the plants. She knows they are illegal, but the beating
horticulturist heart within allows her to take one and only one plant
from its resting place, and save it in the quiet of her greenhouse.
There, the weed grows like gangbusters. Quite innocently, Grace askes
Matthew how much the plant is worth? "It's like gold" he says, and a
plan sprouts in Grace's head. Grace rescues the remainder of Matthew's
hidden stock and sets to work breeding new sprouts in a hydroponic
garden. That takes an enormous amount of capital, specifically, hours
and hours of the brightest light, which illuminates the countryside for
miles around. The entire town sees the lightshow. They set their clocks
by it and the local constable seems blissfully ignorant. The plants
which Grace has cultivated, when all is said and done, would win raves
from anyone who has ever had any exposure to raw buds on a stick. High
Times magazine could do a cover story.</P>
<P>Two things to emphasize here: Grace is not a dopehead. She doesn't have
anything to do with the stuff until she insists on a sample so that she
could know what this pernicious weed is doing to people. Second, Grace
doesn't want anyone taking a fall for her illegal actions, so she packs
up a couple of sticks and heads for London's sleazy market district on
Portobello Road, leaving Matthew far behind. She sticks out like a sore
thumb and is rescued from certain doom by her late husband's mistress.
There's little anger between the two ladies, though one has connections
the other doesn't. Then, in slam bang fashion, a street hippie is
praying to his God after two tokes on a sample, a connection is made
with a sleazy underworld type Dealer (Tcheky Karyo), and a breakneck
chase is on as Grace heads back up to Cornwall to fulfill her part of
the bargain. Following her is a lackey of the Dealer and the hippie.
Following them are the local cops. And waiting at her home is the
banker, ready to seize the estate.</P>
<P>Wrapping it all off is a surprising, and totally legal, pair of
sequences which have to be seen to be believed. So see it already.</P>
<P>Blethyn's Grace may be sweet and a bit naive, but she's got gumption.
Ferguson's Matthew is a perfect example of a lackadaisakle man who must
face up to his responsibilities as a life partner to Nicky (Valerie
Edmond), a woman who can gut a mackeral in ten seconds flat and the
mother of his forthcoming child -- he doesn't know about that, which
adds a nice layer to the story.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Saving Grace, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$7.00</PRE>
<PRE>An absolute delight.</PRE>
