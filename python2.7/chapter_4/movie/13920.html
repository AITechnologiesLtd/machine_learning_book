<P>        Film criticism may well be the Art of the Fool, the last refuge
of those who wish to be involved in the movie industry but lack the
talent or drive needed to actually create something.  How does the
expression go?  "Those who can, do; those who can't, criticize."
While this may be a bit harsh (and is certainly not true in every
case), I think it does have some basis in reality.
        I hope to get involved in the film business one day, though I
have not yet produced anything except some experimental footage that
I'd be reluctant to screen for any but my most non-critical friends.
I am still learning what makes a shot work, the effects that different
types of lighting can have, and the many ways in which a storyline can
be revealed to the audience (with "The Truman Show" being one of the
finest examples I've ever seen).  Film criticism, to me, is part of the
learning process.  By subjecting myself to as many films as possible,
then writing my comments while the film is still fresh in my mind, I
have learned a great deal about what makes a particular film "good" or
"bad," at least in my eyes.  I notice the frequency with which certain
cliches (such as "I have a BAD feeling about this" or "I'm sorry, I
was wrong.  Can you ever forgive me?") crop up in different movies.
Sharing these observations with all of you helps my film education,
just as it hopefully offers new insight for you, the reader, as well.
        But it's important to remember that no matter what credentials a
critic has, everything boils down in the end to one person's opinion.
Despite the fact that I personally adore "Star Wars" and consider it one
of this century's most incredible cinematic achievements, I know people
who hate it.  "Citizen Kane," the best movie ever made according to the
recent American Film Institute survey, is not universally adored.  (I
like and respect it, but I still think "Casablanca" is superior.)  My
favorite film critic, Roger Ebert, cited this year's "Dark City" as a
cinematic masterpiece, praising its visuals and sinister feel; I, on the
other hand, found the film mediocre at best and less than that much of
the time.
        The point is, there's no "right" or "wrong" in this field; all a
critic can do is explain why he or she thinks a film is or isn't worth
seeing.  As often as not, you'll disagree with the opinions they provide.
That's fine.  In my short time reviewing films on the Internet, I've
received a mountain of correspondence from people who have seen (or opted
not to see) films based on my recommendation, as well as those who saw a
film before reading my review and later dropped me a line to tell me how
much they did (or did not) agree with me.  It's flattering to know that
people can decide to go to a movie they had no intention of seeing, based
on your recommendation.  I enjoy reading the responses my reviews
generate, even the ones that dispute what I have to say.  Believe me,
there are plenty of them.
        Nothing I've written, however, has generated more feedback than
some offhand comments I made about Steven Spielberg's latest film,
"Saving Private Ryan."  After casually mentioning how disappointed I was
by the movie on both my favorite IRC chat room and a "general talk"
newsgroup, I was flooded by a number of intelligent, well-thought-out
rebuttals.  I debated the film's merits or lack thereof with several of
these filmgoers, and ignored the vulgar messages I received from a
half-dozen or so others which questioned my sanity and insulted my
heritage.  Clearly, people respond to this movie in a way almost without
precedent.   For these reasons, I specifically decided I would not
review the film.  When so many people disagree with me (and indeed,
I've yet to come across a single other person either on the internet or
in "real-life" who shares my opinion on the movie), then maybe it's
just me, you know?
        Ego intervened, however.  I've received three different e-mails
this week from readers asking for my opinion on the film.  "We haven't
seen it, because we want to know what you think about it first,"
explains one particularly kind letter.  So I've decided to compromise.
Rather than write a completely new review of the film, I'm going to
plunder the e-mails and posts I've already written about the movie,
cobbling together a Frankenstein-esque review from these many "parts."
As always, if people have comments or questions, I'm all ears.  If
people have insults and ridicule for my opinion, that's fine too; just
don't expect a response.  It's my greatest desire not to get into
another violent arguments over this movie.  Thanks.  --AJB</P>
<P>        In case you missed the point of "Schindler's List," Steven
Spielberg would like you to know that World War II was a bad thing.
His new movie, "Saving Private Ryan," is a shockingly violent yet
surprisingly boring drama which begins during the D-Day invasion of 1944
(giving the director the chance to throw blood and entrails in our face
for half an hour and call it "art") and ends with... well, pretty much
the same scene, except on a bridge rather than a beach.
        Tom Hanks plays Captain John Miller, the leader of a small troop
of American soldiers in the midst of this hell.  Miller has clearly
seen enough violence and destruction to last him the rest of his days;
his hands shake violently when he tries to do something as simple as
take a drink of water.  Isolation is his defense against his
environment-- so secretive is he about his private life that the troop
has a running bet: will the war end before Miller reveals any personal
details about himself to them?
        After surviving a nightmarish battle, Hanks and his soldiers
are given a new mission: to find a soldier named James Ryan and escort
him to safety.  The reason?  It appears that all three of his brothers
were killed in combat on the same day.  The army, figuring that poor
Mrs. Ryan deserves a consolation prize, decides to send the surviving
son home.  The problem is, no one is quite sure where Ryan is, so it's
up to Hanks and his crew to find the poor boy.  For much of the film,
they "search" for him by dashing up to random people and yelling
"Private James Ryan!  Do you know him?"
        The basic premise of the movie is laughably bad.  Raise your
hand if you think the army would feel sorry for a woman whose sons had
died in combat.  From the army's perspective, that's what they're there
for!  Would the military *really* risk the lives of a whole squadron of
people in an attempt to rescue a wayward son, especially when the movie
takes place in June of 1944?  From my rememberence of history, the war
wasn't going particularly well for the Allies at that time.  They'd
surely be making the best possible use of all their resources, not
assigning them to frivilous projects.
        The excuse used to justify the plot: the army thinks it will
be a great morale boost if Ryan can be found and sent home to his
mother.  Beg pardon?  Let me get this straight: you've got thousands
of American soldiers risking their lives in combat every day,
fighting on foreign soil.  They haven't seen their loved ones in
months, or even *years*.  All of a sudden, they learn that Private
James Ryan is going home.  That's supposed to inspire morale?  I'd
think it would inspire resentment and jealousy.  But no matter.
It's the plot of the movie, and we'll let it be.
        After our opening bloodbath, we watch our "heroes" (and I use
the term loosely, since we learn so little about these guys that it's
hard to feel anything at all for them) hike around the countryside and
shoot things for a couple of hours.  During this time, they talk at
great length about very little, tease the "new guy" mercilessly, and
hedge bets on where their captain is from.  These exchanges reek so
badly of cliche' that we immediately know: (1) the new guy will
eventually do something brave and daring, thereby earning the respect
of his peers, and (2) sooner or later, Miller will unveil his life
story to the troops, probably during a moment of great tension.
        As always, Tom Hanks's performance is spectacular.  He does
such a fine job with his role that it's possible not to noice how
poorly written his character is.  With his convincing facial gestures
and a world-weariness that seems beyond genuine, Hanks *becomes*
Captain Miller; the problem is, Captain Miller's not very interesting.
The tactic of keeping him aloof from the audience and his troops was
probably intended to make him seem mysterious.  It made me not like
him very much.  Why am I expected to bond with a character that I
know absolutely nothing about?
        Indeed, that's the biggest problem with the film: we're given
absolutely no reason to care about anything happening on the screen at
all.  The members of Miller's troop may as well be played by department-
store mannequins for all the emotion and depth they show.  From time
to time, someone dies.  Does it bother us?  Not once.  We've not been
given a reason to be.
        Also, on a semi-related note: have we become so desensitized
as a society that extreme violence is now funny?  You won't find
another movie with violence this realistic, but at the screening I
attended, the audience greeted much of this footage with giggles and
titters.  One soldier loses his arm and bends down to pick it up.
*audience snickers*  A soldier removes his helmet; immediately his
head explodes in a round of mortar fire, drenching his companions
with brains and bloody goo.  *audience giggles*  And the biggest offense:
Hanks and his men eventually find Private Ryan, after slogging their
way through enemy terrain, losing much of their party in the process.
But get this: it's the WRONG Private Ryan!  The audience shrieked with
delighted laughter at this scene.  I sat in stunned silence.  'Yeah,
that's really funny.  These guys have fought hard for their cause,
shed plenty of blood, seen some of their companions killed... and why?
Because the tip they had on Ryan's whereabouts was wrong!  Boy,
that's a knee-slapper.'  But the audience continued to hoot in utter
delight, as though it were the best practical joke they'd ever seen.
Never have I wanted to slap so many people.
        Spielberg opted to shoot much of the film with hand-held
cameras to capture a documentary/in-the-field look; as such, the
picture shakes badly during many scenes (imagine watching a "movie"
shot by a four-year-old with a camcorder).  I got a splitting headache
while trying to follow the action, and that's the honest truth.  Tripod,
Steven.  You know you want one.
        Let's go back to the film's beginning again.  The story opens
with 30 minutes of nonstop carnage.  That in and of itself is not a
problem, but during these scenes nothing that is relevant to the plot
happens, certainly nothing that requires this much screen time.  We
learn nothing about the characters.  Just because I recognize the
wonderful actor Tom Hanks in the lead role does mean that I will
automatically care what happens to the person he is playing if I
haven't been given any kind of emotional hook into his psyche.
Spielberg spent an awful lot of money on these scenes, but it's a lot
of footage that seems to have no point other than conveying the horrors
of warfare.  I already know that war is a bad thing, and the fact that
the film rubs our nose in it for so long detracts from the pace of the
story.  We don't even learn what the movie is about until we're nearly
an hour into it.  Spielberg seems so in love with the grotesqueness of
these shots that he forgets to include a petty item like "story."
        Contrast this with Spielberg's other WW2 film, the equally
long "Schindler's List" (one of my favorite movies, EVER).  All of
the characters, including the villains, had depth to them.  We felt
the turmoil Oskar Schindler went through.  We saw how his attitude
changed and grew over the course of the movie, and we understood the
decisions he made.  I didn't get any of that from the characters in
"Saving Private Ryan."  No one really changes emotionally, and I've
got to believe that warfare, especially warfare THAT graphic, will
have psychological effects on people.  Apart from Miller's shaking
hands, no one seemed the least bit off-balance.  They're made of
sterner stuff than I.
        In a nutshell: I didn't like Spielberg's approach.  It's
almost as if the movie is saying "Look!  I am showing lots and lots
of very realistic warfare.  Therefore, I am a GREAT FILM.  You will
TAKE ME SERIOUSLY.  You will CRY WHEN I TELL YOU TO.  YOU MUST LIKE
ME!"  Many are calling the film "brilliant"; I'm calling it "the
Emporer's new clothes."  So many critics are raving about the movie
that the majority of cinemagoers are being brainwashed into thinking
it's far better than it really is.
        "Saving Private Ryan" tries much too hard; "Schindler's List,"
apart from the final cemetary scene, played upon your emotions very
subtly.  You never realised just how much you cared about Oskar, but
when the ending rolls around you're blinking back tears.  "Saving
Private Ryan," on the other hand, seems like it was conceived from
the outset as a GREAT FILM.  There's no restraint; everything is so
in-your-face that I frequently found myself closing my eyes-- not to
shut out the visuals, but to simply distance myself from the movie,
which seemed to want to climb into my lap.
        Many will say that's the point: Spielberg is trying to thrust
the horrors of war upon us.  I don't know.  I found myself caring about
good ol' Forrest Gump's war buddies a lot more than these guys, partly
because they (especially Bubba and Lt. Dan) were so well-developed.
When a character dies in "Ryan," I simply shrugged-- just another
"nobody."  I never got the feeling that they (apart from Hanks, near
the end) had anyone back home praying for their safe return.
        When I complained about the film's lack of subtlety on a news-
group, one of the film's many admirers chimed back with, "Does anyone
remember any subtlety in World War II?  Neither do I."  Touche'.  But
you know, I don't recall World War II being billed as entertainment.
        Unfortunately, I can't think of a single reason to recommend
this film, and considering the name of the director, whose work I
usually enjoy, that's surprising.  The characters are uninteresting,
the photography is difficult to watch, the music is generic, the pace
is nonexistant.  It's a shame, but I guess Spielberg needs his failures
to make his triumphs that more powerful.  Forget about "Saving Private
Ryan," friends.  Save your money instead.</P>
