THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST
A film by Martin Scorsese
Starring: Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, and Barbara Hershey
Rated R for violence and nudity</PRE>
<P>    An astonishingly difficult movie to watch, THE LAST TEMPTATION OF =
CHRIST may be Scorsese's most important film, and yet his most =
impossibly abstract as well.  Scorsese presents the life of Jesus =
Christ, through Nikos Kazantzakis' novel, which details the life of =
Christ from approximately 20 until the day of crucifixtion.  Jesus of =
Nazareth (Dafoe) is a carpenter, who opens the film making crosses, so =
that he can escape the fate he is subjected to, his destiny on Earth.  =
Yet, he soon learns his evil ways for aiding in the deaths of others, =
and subjects himself to a desert in exile, in hopes that he can reach =
God.  Before leaving, he asks for forgiveness from Mary Magdelene =
(Barbara Hershey), a prostitute who is also a childhood friend of Jesus. =
=20</P>
<P>After going to the desert, Christ learns his true purpose in life, =
and what he must do.  Aided by Judas (Keitel), he sets off on teaching =
the world his message.  Along the way, he meets John the Baptist, the =
rest of the prophets, and tries to teach the world his message.  Christ =
is also confronted by internal demons and self-doubt, as he tries to =
find his true purpose throughout the entire film.  During the story, =
Judas is the closese ally of Jesus: his betrayal, argues the film, was =
not out of hate, but out of love, in order to allow Christ to die. =20</P>
<P>He is eventually captured, and crucified as per the Bibile.  =
However, as he is about to die on the cross, he is saved by a girl, who =
brings him to his marriage with Mary Magdelene.  The girl is a guardian =
angel who is from God, and who has saved him from his death.  Jesus goes =
on to live a life as a man, as a carpenter, and does not die on the =
cross.  On his deathbed, in the final moments of his life, he is visited =
by the prophets, and by Judas, who denounces his master for "not keeping =
his end of the bargain."  Judas reveals the angel to truly be the devil, =
and the life Jesus had lived to be the ultimate selfish act.  Jesus =
escapes from his deathbed, and asks his father for forgiveness, for =
succumbing to his last temptation.</P>
<P>Visually and aurally, the film is absolutely breathtaking.  No other =
director has even come close to realizing Jerusalem during the time of =
Christ's life to the screen.  Peter Gabriel contributes a score than is =
simply astonishing, with pulsing rhythms that capture the viewer.  The =
performances are simply exquisite, with Dafoe leading the way with a =
mesmerizing turn as Jesus.  Keitel, although his accent is a problem, is =
passionately brilliant, fighting through language to bring the character =
to life.  The visuals are also amazing.  Scorsese frames his movie in a =
harsh tone, leaving the impression that Jesus truly is a man who is =
having human frailties.</P>
<P>The film, though, has many trouble spots.  Paul Schrader's script is =
one.  Schrader uses modern-day New York English to tell the story, along =
with New York words, New York mannerisms, and New York slang speech.  =
The film also does not focus on the godly aspects of Christ.  There is =
no underlying message behind the man's words.  The film fails to capture =
the glory and splendor of Christ.  Had it faithfully explored that =
aspect, than the dichotomy of Jesus' soul, his frailties and doubt mixed =
with his unmistakable glory, would have been simply spectacular.  The =
message of Christ is confused between love and violence, and the film =
merely tells us Jesus is great, instead of showing us his greatness.</P>
<P>The film is also overlong.  It just drags in the middle, with =
nothing truly happening.  Christ is a confused figure, in the sense that =
the audience doesn't know who he really is.  Schrader forgets to give =
Jesus a message, to show that he truly is the Messiah, to give him the =
divinity.  Without that, he is a rambling prophet, who the audience =
themselves do not believe.  There are several moments of accidental =
hilarity, and most of them occur when Jesus is attempting to preach.  =
There are moments of brief awe and power, followed by moments of =
confused hilarity.</P>
<P>That said, the controversial Temptation sequence is something to =
behold.  It is a step in an unexpected direction, one that leaves the =
audience puzzled, until the arrival of the disciples.  It is a simply =
breathtaking scene, with Jesus about to die as a mortal.  It is truly =
one of Scorsese's finest moments.  It is unfortunate that Scorsese =
couldn't make a film about Christ as powerful as that one scene. =20</P>
