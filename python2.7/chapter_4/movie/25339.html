<P>Director Bryan Singer ("The Usual Suspects") takes on a task that has had fans
of The X-Men comics frothing at the mouth for years - bringing their beloved
super heroes to the big screen. This daunting mission, with its many special
effects and giant budget, is now finished and the talented helmer has succeeded
in bringing the comic characters to life for both fans and newcomers alike in
"X-Men."</P>
<PRE>ROBIN:</PRE>
<P>Every few millennia, man undergoes certain changes, or mutations, that help
humankind to evolve into the next level of being. But, when these mutations
occur, the current residents of Earth fear the changes and strike out at the
mutants. Now, the world is in the midst of another round of mutations and the
'normal' humans, led by firebrand Senator Kelly (John Davison), want a final
solution for the problem. The senator and his followers do not want the
mutants, called X-Men, to roam free and a new Holocaust is brewing.</P>
<P>Psychic Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) heads a government program
that trains and educates the next generation of mankind, nurturing his wards to
develop the various changes they are undergoing. He also leads the X-Men,
good-guy mutants who use their power to protect Earth from the evil Magneto
(Ian McKellen). Magneto is a magnetically charged tyrant mutant who wants to 
take over the world for his own selfish purposes. The only thing standing 
between him and world domination is Xavier and his X-Men.</P>
<P>The professor is joined in the battle by his protigi of psychic power, Dr. Jean
Grey (Famke Janssen), Storm (Halle Berry) and the laser-eyed Cyclops (James
Marsden) in his quest to defeat the wicked plans of Magneto. The good guys are
well matched by the evil boss's minion - the shape shifting Mystique (Rebecca
Romijn-Stamos), the agile Toad (Ray Park, "Star Wars: Episode One") and the
powerful and mean Sabretooth (Tyler Mane). Thrown into the mix of this looming
battle is a surgically altered mutant and loner named Logan (Hugh Jackman).
Both sides vie for the loyalty of the battler, who also goes by the moniker
Wolverine, as Magneto hatches a plot to mutate the entire membership of the
United Nations and take over the world.</P>
<P>Director Singer walks a very fine line in this adaptation of the nearly four
decade old Marvel comic book series. The trick in adapting such fan-dedicated
source material to a feature film lay in appealing to an audience that is not
exclusively made up of just the fan base. A recent example of the difficulty of
maintaining such a balance can be seen in the 1997 sci-fi film, "Spawn."  That
actioner went under the assumption that catering to the fans, alone, was enough
to generate substantial box office bucks. It wasn't and the film didn't do as
well as its producers had hoped.</P>
<P>Singer strikes a balance for the fan and non-fan that does two things. The
newcomer to this potential film franchise is fed enough background information
so that there is a basic understanding of what "X-Men" is all about. The
makers don't dwell on the education process for the novice viewer, providing
the gist of the material needed to move things along. It gets down to business 
once the viewer is told, basically, that stuff happens - people mutate.</P>
<P>When the story kicks in, the characters are introduced with little fanfare as
the individual powers of each are explained or displayed. This is where the
copious special F/X kick in and the super powers of Storm, Cyclops, Toad and
the rest are displayed with all kinds of flash and smoke. Not a lot of time is
spent on character development, but the crew of talented actors help flesh out 
their assignments, in some cases quite well.</P>
<P>Much of the focus of the story is on Logan. He's a sullen loner, a mutant who
was altered to accommodate a super strong skeletal frame. He can also thrust
saber-like blades from his hands and has astonishing healing powers. The
Wolverine takes on the task of protecting a young mutant named Rogue (Anna
Paquin). Rogue is pivotal in Magneto's plans and it's up to Logan and the rest
to stop him. Hugh Jackman gives dimension to his super hero performance with his
dark wit and brooding demeanor. Of course, his hairdo and mutton chop sideburns
help lend to his Wolverine image, too.</P>
<P>The rest of the cast, led by Patrick Stewart, fare unevenly. Stewart is his
usual stalwart self and is made for the role of Charles Xavier. He exudes
leadership quality and kindness as he guides his X-Men into battle. Ian
McKellen looks good as chief bad guy Magneto, but his evilness is not bad ass 
enough.  Halle Berry, as stormy Storm, gets few lines and isn't allowed to 
break out the F/X laden character who can conjure up a tempest at the drop of 
a hat. Famke Janssen has a nice presence as Jean Grey, though her telekinetic 
powers are no where near as flashy as the others' are.  Anna Paquin is bland 
and emotionless as Rogue, who can suck the life from a person. Paquin's 
performance does much the same to the character. Romijn-Stamos puts it on the 
line as the shape-shifting Mystique, undergoing grueling makeup prep for many 
hours each day. It pays off as the former model's lithe gracefulness fits the 
sexy, somewhat reptilian character that can become an identical copy of whoever 
she wants. Ray Parks provides terrific athletic ability as the super tongued 
Toad.</P>
<P>The production befits the material. If you expect flashy F/X, you get 'em here.
Each of the X-Men has a unique power and the effects team does a solid job of
making each special. Costuming takes a real departure from the colorful dress
of the comics, replacing colors with sleek black uniforms. The stylish set 
designs give the film a stunning look - make note of the futuristic prison 
setting - that suits the comic book feel of the film. There is also some nice 
homage to such classic films as "Forbidden Planet" and, with a battle royale 
atop the Statue of Liberty, Alfred Hitchcock's "Saboteur."</P>
<P>As expected, the film ends with a couple of set ups that are, undoubtedly,
intended as the basis for the X-Men franchise. There are two more films in
development and the material should flow quite easily for the sequels. The deft
way that Singer and company have transferred the action comics to the big
screen reps one of the best efforts since "Superman II" and will win some new 
fans.  Older auds may not be too taken by "X-Men," but the demographic it aims 
at hits the bull's-eye. I give it a B.</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Director Bryan Singer, who last cast Ian McKellen as a Nazi war criminal
in "Apt Pupil," begins his comic superhero movie "X-Men" with McKellen's
character of Magneto as a victim of his former self, establishing his
metal bending powers as his parents are herded into a gated Jewish ghetto.  
This backstory also signals what's good about the X-Men tale - the bad
guy isn't simply evil for badness' sake but fears persecution for his
difference, while the good guys, led by Patrick Stewart's telepathic Professor
X, protect a human race that often acts reprehensibly.  This is no simple
morality play.</P>
<P>The story (story by Tom DeSanto and Bryan Singer, screenplay by David Hayter)
very effectively sets up the world of X-Men even for those like myself who
have no familiarity with the comicbook series.  In a near future Senator Robert 
Jefferson Kelly (Bruce Davison, "Longtime Companion") is fighting for
legislation that would require mutants to be 'outed' because of their 
potential danger to humans.  In response, Magneto and his camp (wrestler
Tyler Mane as Sabretooth, swimsuit model Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique
and Phantom Menacer Ray Park as Toad) wants to take over the world and
plans to begin by using the life force powers of Rogue ("The Piano's" eleven
year old Oscar winner Anna Paquin, now an adolescent) to juice a machine
in the Statue of Liberty which will irradiate the entire population of New 
York City, killing Rogue in the process.  </P>
<P>The real star of this ensemble piece is Australian newcomer Hugh Jackman's
Wolverine, a conflicted loner with heightened senses and the ability to
shoot longer razor claws out of his knuckles (he resembles Quentin from
the old 70's gothic soap "Dark Shadows").  When Rogue runs away from home
after putting the first boy she's kissed into a coma, she recognizes Wolverine 
as a fellow mutant in a smoky bar and becomes his protegee.  When they're 
attacked on the road by Sabretooth, they're aided by Cyclops (James Marsden, 
"Gossip") and Storm (Halle Berry) and whisked away to Professor X's school for 
mutants.  Rogue does well, but Wolverine still bristles, loner that he is, 
even as he falls for Cyclops' girlfriend, Dr. Jean Gray (Famke Janssen, 
"Rounders"), setting up a nice overlapping love triangle as Rogue develops a 
crush on the wolfman.  The Wolverine/Cyclops friction opens the door for some
refreshing humor to lighten the dark film.</P>
<P>"X-Men" is story and character driven, yet it does feature some fine
fight scenes, where Ray Park and Romijn-Stamos really shine.  Toad scrambles
across ceilings and flicks a grossly extended tongue while Mystique
flexes her perfect bod attired in nothing but blue paint and scales (which
required fifteen hours a day to put on and remove!).  Jackman (who replaced
Dougray Scott when M:I-2's shooting schedule ran over) will surely become
a star with this vehicle, although not all the oddly-assembled cast fare 
as well.  The bad X-Men have practically zilch in the way of dialogue
except for Magneto and the Oscar-nominated McKellen is a little bland in the
role.  On the flip side, Patrick Stewart seems born to play the
wheelchair-bound Professor X and former friend of Magneto (they still enjoy
a good game of chess).  Janssen is an appropriately sensitive Gray and
Marsden portrays Cyclops as a gung-ho hotshot, but Berry does little more
than look cool with her white hair and black cape while Paquin is stuck in
the victim role.  Davison is sleezy as the rabble rousing Senator who
meets a spectacularly inventive demise.</P>
<P>Special effects range all over the map from cheesy lightening bolts to
rather cool stepping slates that appear in front of Magneto as he walks
through mid air.  Cinematographer Tom Sigel, who brought such a unique
look to "Three Kings," does little to distinguish himself here, with the
overall look of the film being too dark.  Claustrophobic sets (Production 
Design by John Myhre, Art Direction by Paul D. Austerberry, Tamara Deverell
and Rando Schmook) also give the film a low rent feel.  Hopefully the
sequels will be brightened up and opened out.  Costume design (Louise 
Mingenbach, Bob Ringwood) is pedestrian while Makeup (Ann Brodie) is
outstanding.</P>
<P>Far more serious than the ragtag "Mystery Men," "X-Men" are like 
live action "Pokemon" for adults.  This franchise seems destined to
outlive the superhero series that came before.</P>
