                       A film review by Rod Crawford

<P>A notable lack of reviews of classics in the r.a.m. review archives has
led me to try my hand at what may turn into a series...starting with one
of Hollywood's better attempts at filming a mystery novel with atmosphere. </P>
<P>In fact, Preminger here lays on atmosphere with a trowel. The original
novel is a nice, readable mystery with good character development, but it
falls short of being a classic in its own right. The screenplay adheres
closely to the original story, with necessary compression, but adds
episodes to make the character conflicts (external and internal) more
cinematic and allow for the stormy-night and darkened-room images of the
film noir style. A surprising change is total omission of the crucial clue
(I won't spoil it) that, in the novel, leads McPherson to the killer. This
can't be accidental: in the movie, the mood is the thing, not the mystery.</P>
<P>A very brief plot summary: Homicide detective Mark McPherson (Dana
Andrews) investigates the murder by shotgun of advertising executive Laura
Hunt (Gene Tierney) in her posh apartment. Among the suspects: her fiancee
Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price) whom she may have been about to dump; her
social mentor and platonic lover, super-cultured and bitterly sardonic
Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb); her jet-setting aunt and heir (Judith
Anderson) who is, shall we say, rather fond of Shelby herself.</P>
<P>In physical types, casting made major departures from the novel, where
Waldo was fat (Webb is thin), Laura was thin (Tierney is not), McPherson
limped (Andrews doesn't) and Shelby was a hunk (Price is hardly that,
though in 1944 he was not yet typed in sinister roles). In acting,
however, Webb makes the role of Waldo a dominating one; he thoroughly
deserved his Oscar nomination. He also has most of the best lines in a
script full of delightful zingers like "I'm not kind, I'm vicious. It's
the secret of my charm."  Gene Tierney, whom we meet turning heads in
flashbacks, was not one of the decade's more charismatic actresses, but
her beauty atones for much, and she is here photographed with such
lustrous, flattering skill that we accept without question her devastating
effect on the men in her orbit. Price is believable in a weak role, but
his intermittent attempts at a southern accent are best forgotten. Judith
Anderson is perfect; those whose image of her is conditioned by REBECCA
(1940) will be surprised at how glamorous she looks here. Dana Andrews
starts the film as his usual stolid self, but gets better as he goes
along. He really begins to come to life in the scene where McPherson
realizes he's falling in love with a woman he knows to be dead: a bizarre,
almost necrophilic touch that really gives you an idea of the film's mood.</P>
<P>So here we are, back with mood and atmosphere. David Raksin's haunting
"Laura" theme music (which became a big-band standard) contributes
largely, as do settings, dialogue and all. Scenes like the mob of
sightseers outside the apartment building give a welcome touch of
film-noir cynicism. But pictorial effects contribute most to making LAURA
a true classic (more so on the big screen than in video). As with more
typical film noir, much takes place at night; even by day, cinematographer
LaShelle somehow manages to backlight key characters most of the time. The
high-contrast black and white images are sharper than "real" life. Shadows
are used with skill and precision; the brief scene where McPherson follows
Shelby through a stormy night is a gem of its type. And the key, almost
dreamlike scenes in Laura's apartment are suitably dominated by the large,
watchful-seeming portrait of Laura on the wall. Preminger meant to give
his audience the shivers with a very subtle, non-horror dose of pure
atmosphere. Despite some small plot holes, I think he succeeded.</P>
