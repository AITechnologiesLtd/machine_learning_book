<P>John Sayles' Men With Guns is a film that has received immense critical
acclaim, and, having finally seen it, I think I understand why.  Sayles
is a unique film maker:  he writes, directs, and edits all of his films
outside of any studio system, beyond distribution rights and the usual
Hollywood bureaucracy.  When I watch his films (the most recent being
Lone Star, which I loved), I get the feeling that I'm seeing his exact
vision, the way he wants it presented.  I imagine him as an independent
James Cameron (although the glaring difference in budget needs between
the two men is striking).</P>
<P>Sayles tackles "issues" in his films.  He doesn't just tell stories--he
has far-reaching themes and agendas.  Men With Guns centers around Dr.
Fuentes (Federico Luppi), an older gentleman unhappy with his life.  He
decides to take a vacation to see former students who are helping the
sick in impoverished villages in the countryside.  Not long into his
journey, he runs into one of his students.  This young man was a very
promising doctor when Fuentes knew him, but now he's selling illegal
drugs and merchandise to get by.  </P>
<P>Fuentes is alarmed by this encounter, and he expedites his quest to
find the rest of his students.  He journeys further into the country,
and meets travelling companions in a few places.  He finds a young boy
(Dan Rivera Gonzalez) whose parents have apparently been killed by
guerillas.  It's about this time that the big picture of the situation
becomes clearer:  the men with guns described in the title are two
distinct groups of people--the military and the guerillas.</P>
<P>With each village that Fuentes visits, he finds that his students have
been executed in torturous ways.  Some of them were executed by the
military for helping the guerillas; some were killed for the opposite. 
The point is that these men with guns roam the countryside and brandish
their power on the unarmed masses, who are all so frightened that they
don't speak to strangers, regardless of how non-threatening the
strangers appear.  Also during his journey, Fuentes encounters a couple
of American tourists (Mandy Patinkin and Kathryn Grody) who are
oblivious to the truly awful things going on around them.</P>
<P>Sayles does an incredible job of developing the several characters that
he introduces in his film.  Fuentes, played with conviction and grace by
Luppi, is a fascinating person--he's a man who has recently lost his
wife, and is now seeking absolution in finding his students, to see how
they are making their lives important.  Fuentes also meets a former army
soldier (Damian Delgado), who is now a frail, paranoid man without
pride.  One of the most poignant subplots involves a former priest
(Damian Alcazar) who has lost his faith.</P>
<P>The framework of the story is direct, very well-organized, and simple
to follow.  Much of the scenery is lush with a rich emerald green
overtone, and the film is always appeasing to the eye.  Sayles' dialogue
(in Spanish with English subtitles) is sharp, and often subtly funny. 
I'd also like to point out that this is an American film--recent
American films about foreign cultures (Kundun, for example) have the
characters speaking English, which greatly takes away from the
authenticity of the film.  It's nice to see that Sayles was willing to
sacrifice a lot of box office attention to make his film as realistic as
possible.</P>
<P>Sayles is not a director who bogs down his audience in sentimentality. 
Although the themes and issues in Men With Guns are heavy, and often
very sad, Sayles completely avoids the usual treatment of sappy music
and elaborate camera work to heighten the emotions.  The result is not
dryness, but material that is more thought-provoking than emotional. 
The issues here, centering a great deal around oppression and mindless
war-mentality, seem, at first glance, only relevant to the country in
which the film takes place (which is an unnamed Central American
country).  </P>
<P>But this is a film, I imagine, that gathers strength the more times you
see it.  It takes multiple viewings to understand the full significance
of the story in relation to the setting.  As I watched Men With Guns, I
was always interested, but I never found myself wrapped up in the
story.  I was only marginally moved by the conclusion, and only one or
two scenes throughout truly grabbed me.  I wanted to be more exhilarated
when the film was over, but I almost felt indifferent.</P>
<P>The reason for this is simple:  there is so much going on in Men With
Guns.  There are many round characters, a developed story, and themes so
powerful they almost outshine the rest of the film.  I think I was too
caught up in my thoughts to be moved by the story, which is why I
believe that a second and third viewing of the film is necessary to
truly understand everything that Sayles is doing.  I admire this film,
and appreciate it for its intelligence and completeness in its
exploration of its themes.  John Sayles is a poetic film maker, and,
like most poems, this film needs to be experienced more than once.</P>
