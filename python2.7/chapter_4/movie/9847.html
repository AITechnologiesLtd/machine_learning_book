<PRE>METROPOLIS (1926)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Fritz Lang
Writer: Fritz Lang (from the novel by Thea von Harbou)
Starring: Alfred Abel, Brigitte Helm, Gustav Fröhlich, Rudolf
Klein-Rogge</P>
<P>Before Orwell wrote "1984," before Aldous Huxley wrote "Brave New
World," and way before Ridley Scott directed "Blade Runner," German
director created "Metropolis," one of the oldest films to deal with the
future as bleak, if not the first.  "Metropolis" is one of the few films
that is deemed a classic, and is also brilliant besides that.  And even
if it was silent, and extremely old, I was never bored.</P>
<P>"Metropolis" is a world in the far future (maybe 21st century) where the
rich and elite live above ground, while the workers slave underneath the
city with horrible conditions.  The king of Metropolis is the fascist
and selfish John Frederson (Alfred Abel), who has no love for the
workers, even if they are basically running his life.  He's so feared
and respected that when he fires a worker, the worker tries to shoot
himself.</P>
<P>One day, his son, Freder (Gustav Fröhlich), is hanging around in his
Pleasure Garden with some people, and a mysterious woman enters - Maria
(Brigitte Helm) - with a bunch of kids, who are the children of the
workers.  She causes him to actually take a peak at the workers and
their environment, and he unfortunately witnesses a horrific accident,
which claims the lives of some of the workers.  From that point on, he
has total sympathy for the workers, and will try his best to be their
futuristic Moses.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, John has met with the twisted scientist/inventor Rotwang
(Rudolf Klein-Rogge), who lives and works in a bizarre little wooden
house in the midst of the giant city.  It turns out Rotwang has invented
a robot who can do everything the workers do, only better, thus
rendering the workers obsolete and expendable.  But as the two learn
about the rebellious workers, John decides to try and make the robot
look just like that of Maria, who is the rebel's official or unofficial
leader and philosopher.</P>
<P>Thus begins a masterpiece of a film which satirizes the class system,
slavery, and even unions.  Besides that, it's also just one hip little
flick.  The world that it creates is totally memorble, even if it has
been ripped off in hundreds of films.  One of the many amazing things
about this flick is how innovative it is.  The special effects are
surprisingly good for a film made in 1926, with a couple
realistic-looking explosions, a robot that moves believably, and a set
which looks absolutely stunning (with buildings reaching up as far as
the eye can see, although the flying cars are just usual planes).</P>
<P>I was going to rent this once, but found it was only available in video
stores under the 1984 re-release.  Let me explain why you shouldn't rent
this (even though I haven't): it includes some extra scenes not put
together by the director (Fritz Lang, who would go on to direct that
serial killer classic, "M"), a tinted frame and some coloring instead of
the gorgeous black and white photography, and a musical score by...Pat
Benatar, Loverboy, and Queen, among others.  I don't know about you, but
this just causes me to cringe up, and even though I could just turn the
volume down, it would still be tinted and all messed up.  So I settled
for paying 5 bucks for a pre-recorded crap copy by "Hollywood Gold,"
which distributes old films in "highest quality EP mode," which is
pretty much an oxymoron, but sometimes it's the only way one can see
classic pictures without seeing them all screwed up.  This is the only
acceptable way to see this film, until a better non-Queen version comes
out.</P>
<P>At the end, we are left with just pure satisfaction.  We've gotten a
wonderfully crafted satire, all wrapped around with awesome visuals and
great effects.  Some stuff that sticks in one's mind is: the workers
being ferried off to work; the first big explosion; Rotwang showing off
his robot invention for the first time; the giant riot towards the end;
and the witch-burning scene; among several others.  Even if this weren't
a powerful narrative, it'd still be cool to watch.</P>
<P>"Metropolis" is one of the most innovative and amazing films I've really
ever seen, and shows that old sci-fi doesn't have to include a dumb
story and bad special effects.  "Metropolis" is a film about ideas, and
it incorporates the cool special effects not only without taking from
the story, but actually adding to it.  If you're a fan of anything
futuristic, I would recommend you check out this absolutely brilliant
masterpiece.</P>
