<P>   By being extra careful--eating right, exercising, moderating 
drinking and avoiding tobacco--we might cheat death for a
while.  In the end the grim reaper gets us.  How would you
feel, though, if you run into a person who could tell you more
or less when you're going to die?  This is the fascinating
concept behind first-time helmer James Wong's supernatural
thriller, "Final Destination," a teen-centered picture that
stands out from the "Scream" pack by avoiding slashers,
threats of slashers, and psychos, and yet keeps us on the
edge of our seats almost throughout.  The script is not what
rivets us: the screenplay was written by a committee.  But
Wong's graphic Rube Goldberg scenes are captivating to a
fault.  Characters die by some version of that great
cartoonist's notion of falling dominoes.  Example: A bowling
ball might roll down a ramp, dislodge a rock, which in turn fall
onto your toe which causes you to jump, hit your head on an
electric wire which breaks, fall into a puddle in which you land
and become electrocuted.  The schemes that Wong uses to
dispatch these mostly attractive characters are not only
ingenious: they provide some of the comic tongue-in-cheek
moments that are part and parcel of the genre.</P>
<P>   Photographed by Robert McLachlan in lovely Victoria, B.C.
to stand in for suburban areas of New York State and for
Paris, "Final Destination" centers on handsome Devon Sawa
("Idle Hands") in the role of Alex, an entirely healthy-looking
high school kid who has joined others in his French class for
a 10-day field trip to Paris.  Though the youngsters don't
carry guns, they could pass for high-school kids anywhere in
the country--making out in the airport lounge, shoving each
other playfully and not so playfully, freely using four-letter
words.  Just before takeoff from JFK, Alex has a graphic
premonition that the aircraft will explode upon takeoff, giving
director Wong the privilege off creating perhaps the scariest,
most trenchant look at an airline disaster from the point of
view of the passengers ever filmed.  Those who do not get
sucked out of the plane are slammed around the cabin and
eventually fried by a great ball of fire.  </P>
<P>   Alex creates a panicked disturbance to the dismay of his
classmates--who are looking forward to landing at DeGaulle
in seven hours--but a handful of his pals and one teacher join
him in bolting onto land.  Minutes later, the kids witness a
huge explosion that shatters the large windows of the lounge,
and from that point develop mixed feelings about Alex.  On
the one hand they are grateful for being saved.  On the other
they wonder whether simply being around this guy will mark
them for death--and no wonder.  Alex realizes that Death will
not tolerate being cheated and is going to go after these
people with a vengeance.  Alex illuminates a scheme by
which one survivor after another will soon die and to boot, he
knows the exact order of each person's demise.</P>
<P>   While the one hundred minutes of this movie seem to go
by like a shot, few films of this genre can match the delirium
of the initial twenty minutes as Wong takes us from the
comfortable home of Alex and his folks into the quick dream
sequence.  He follows up with a rousing eruption that insures
that "Final Destination" had better draw good box office its
first weekend because you'll never see this on in-flight motion
pictures.  Guaranteed.</P>
<P>   Some minor flaws challenge credibility.  Why does the
engineer not stop his train after he crashes into an
automobile on the tracks, totaling the car and presumably
killing its passengers?  And where are all these well-to-do
caring parents at take-off time?  Not one drives the young
people to JFK or hangs around to see the happy bunch off. 
The teens are a stereotypical bunch, all alike in some
respects but each representing a standard character trait.  Ali
Carter as Clear Rivers is the strong, intelligent type who
stands by her man and has faith in his ability to predict the
near future, while Kerr Smith in the role of Carter Horton is
the handsome but malicious kid who thinks he controls his
own destiny--that he will never die.  Wong has Daniel
Roebuck and Roger Guenveur Smith play the obligatory FBI
agents with some humor. When Agent Schreck Wiene
complains to his partner that "this kid gives me the creeps,"
Agent Roebuck counters, "Don't take this the wrong way, but
sometimes you give me the creeps."</P>
<P>   With "Final Destination" a more-or-less standard narrative
with the usual suspects in the role of teens, their teachers
and parents, and the officers watching them, turns into a
vibrant film pervaded with ingenious death-inducing devices,
an uncompromisingly vivid recreation of an air disaster taken
within the cabin and followed up smartly with a shattering
discharge, and an appropriate combination of somber
discussions and a lightly mocking mood.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 100 minutes.  (C) 2000
