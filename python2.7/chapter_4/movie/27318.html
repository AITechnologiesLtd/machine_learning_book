<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A meant to be chic sci-fi film, set in an Ohio high school, that pays
homage to a number of other trashy genre horror films, but especially to
horror classics such as "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" and "The Thing"
and more surprisingly to "The Breakfast Club," as in the film's best
moments, it explores teen relationships and the pressure put on teens to
succeeed by parents and from peer pressure to conform with the group.
The fast-paced story, the crisp editing, and the atmospheric music plus
all the schlock horror it could throw out to the audience by using those
traditional podlike aliens, helped make this a silly venture geared
mainly for the under 25 crowd (I'm not only referring to age, but to
I.Q.).</P>
<P>It was most appealing when the teens confronted their real romantic and
self-image problems and seemed to use the gore from this ridiculous
story, to mildly get in some satire about every conceivable high school
type they could fit into their story line, with the following six
alienated students representing Herrington High School: the depressive
outsider, sci-fi specialist and unattractive loner Stokely (Clea
DuVall); the jock who is upset that his grade 'D' was changed to an 'A'
and quits playing football because he doesn't want special treatment,
Stan (Shawn Hotosy); the new student from Atlanta who is as sweet as
pie, but makes no friends here, Marybeth (Laura Harris); the beautiful
but stuck up bitchy cheerleader and editor of the school newspaper, the
acid-tongued Delilah (Jordana Brewster); the nice, brainy nerd who gets
bullied by the jocks and apologizes to them for taking up their space,
Casey (Elijah Wood); and the underachieving school science whiz, hustler
and dealer of homemade speed that is inhaled, who is without parental
supervision and is doing his bit to deconstruct America, Zeke (Josh
Hartnett). All the students were stereotypes of the characters they were
playing, jostling to break out of the cookie cutter mold they were in.</P>
<P>In the mystery taking place, the teens try to save their school and the
world from an alien master killer. "The Faculty" featured a running
battle between authority figures (the faculty) and the misfits (the
teenagers).</P>
<P>When an unknown parasite is found on the campus grounds and brought into
biology class by Casey, the teacher observes that this creature is
something he has never seen before and will call in the experts at the
university to identify it, but it comes to life when it becomes moist
and suddenly has sharp teeth, and soon it disappears from the fish bowl
it was stored in.</P>
<P>Members of the faculty are taking over by the thirsty alien parasite and
become docile, smiling, and emotionless clones of human beings. There
are only six diverse students left to defeat the aliens and they must
learn to put aside their differences and work together. But they don't
know who is an alien and who is human, and can't find out until it's too
late, except if they snort Zeke's homemade caffeine concoction to
destroy the alien (drugs are cool in this film--they only kill the bad
guys, which is the most daring thing the film stated about the
rebellious students).</P>
<P>All the faculty members are also stereotypes: Coach Willis (Robert
Patrick), the first victim, is the gung-ho football coach and
hot-tempered disciplinarian; Mrs. Olson (Piper Laurie), the cautionary
veteran music teacher, is the second victim, and soon Principal Drake
(Bebe Neuwirth) becomes an alien. She is a repulsive purveyor of false
educational standards and represents the Establishment. It's only a
matter of a day and a half before the rest of the staff - the popular
science teacher Mr. Furlong (Jon Stewart); the bored literature teacher
Mr. Tate (Daniel Von Bargen); the sniffling school nurse, Harper (Salma
Hayek); and the timid Miss Burke (Famke Janssen) - succumb. So, it's a
battle of students versus faculty, as the students figure out what to do
by discussing what other films and literary works did when confronted by
the same aliens. Amusingly, they think that the past films may have been
part of a plot to fool everybody into not taking alien invaders
seriously and therefore making it possible for them to let their guard
down for a real alien attack.</P>
<P>Robert Rodriguez ("El Mariachi"/ "Desperado"), the director, and Kevin
Williamson ("Scream"), the screenwriter, have created a film that lacks
suspense, lacks freshness, lacks wit, and suffers from some rather lame
special effects. If there is enjoyment to be found, it's in the frantic
moments when the students are acting out their stereotypes and some of
the vilest things come up out of their wiser-than-they-should-be mouths.
It's a cult film for those with a taste for earwigs, a stomach for slop,
and an appetite for mind altering drugs... . Gee! I wonder why I wasn't
more taken with the film!</P>
