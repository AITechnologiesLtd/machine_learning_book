<PRE>                                COUSINS
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  ***1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1989)</PRE>
<P>        The dramatic comedy COUSINS has all the necessary ingredients: a
witty and whimsical script, inspired performances, a great sense of humor,
a large and wonderful cast, and the beautiful scenery of Vancouver.  It's a
movie of weddings, marriage, family, infidelity, and--oh yes--love.</P>
<P>        Like 3 MEN AND A BABY, COUSINS is an Americanized version of a
French film: 1975's COUSIN, COUSINE.  The plot is complicated, but it goes
something like this.  Larry and Tom are cousins, each of whom is
not-so-happily-married.  Tom starts an affair with Larry's wife, Tish, and
to get even, Larry and Tom's wife, Maria, pretend to have an affair of
their own.  Soon the pretending turns to love and COUSINS is off and
running.</P>
<P>        COUSINS is populated by a wide assortment of interesting characters
and caricatures.  The acting is first rate down to even the smallest
supporting role, and virtually every performance deserves mention.  Ted
Danson (in his first starring film role) finally gets to play a character
with some depth and sensitivity.  While Larry may be confident and charming
like Sam Malone on "Cheers," he is also complex and vulnerable, with more
between his ears than empty space.  As Maria, Isabella Rossellini is a joy
to watch; she is shy, sensuous, and immensely alluring.  Sean Young is
perfectly cast as Larry's picture perfect wife, Tish, a superficial and
trendy make-up consultant.  Keith Coogan, from ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING,
is wonderfully weird and eccentric as Larry's rebellious son, Mitch.  And
finally, Lloyd Bridges in a tour de force performance is Mitch's
rambunctious grandfather; he provides some of COUSINS' best lines and
laughs.</P>
<P>        Like MOONSTRUCK, COUSINS is a mix of drama and comedy.  The film is
larger than life and has a keen sense of the absurd.  It understands human
nature extremely well and milks it for every possible laugh and heart-tug.
How often do you see a movie where you believe that two characters truly
and sincerely care for and love each other, as friends and as lovers?
Well, to its credit, COUSINS is just such a movie.  Let's hope the French
continue to provide us with the inspiration to make films like COUSINS</P>
