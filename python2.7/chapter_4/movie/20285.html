<PRE>I Shot Andy Warhol (R) ***
Starring Lili Taylor, Jared Harris
Directed by Mary Harron
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Lili Taylor nabbed one of her first lead roles in this true life drama about
Valerie Jean Solanas, the woman who shot Andy Warhol in 1968. But the film is
more of a showcase to the ways of the 60s and the influence that Warhol and
other artists had on the people at that time. </P>
<P>Valerie Jean Solanas (Taylor) is a lesbian feminist who as written a book
called SCUM Manifesto, a book (which is now a classic) about the way that men
(like disease, or so she says) have been ruling here for the millions of years
before us. She tries to sell it on the street, and is thrilled when her drag
queen friend is invited to Andy Warhol's pad. This is her chance to sell him
not only on the book, but on some plays that she has been writing.</P>
<P>But Andy is just like all of the other men out there. When a publisher signs
her to a fraud contract and a friend puts her on a television show discussing
homosexuality where the host makes fun of her, she begins to think that Andy is
all behind it. He's been constantly ignoring and making fun of her and she
doesn't like it. Her increasing rage is about to bring on the deadliest of
consequences. </P>
<P>Lili Taylor gives the performance of her career (at least so far) she puts
every ounce that she can into this character and it's a great treat to watch.
Flaws are abound however, most of the film is boring and needs something
interesting to be put on the screen and the story was told harsher than it
needs to be. Still, the film does a good job of examining the inner rage that
overcame the woman and her actions thereafter. If your looking for a cool 60s
noir piece, rent I Shot Andy Warhol, which gets *** stars.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: The main character is lesbian and we see one lesbian encounter.
She is also a prostitute and we see two (not very explicit) sex scenes of her
servicing her customers. It also contains strong language and drug use. Good
