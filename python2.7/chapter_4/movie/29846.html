<PRE>HAPPINESS (1998)
Reviewed by Jerry Saravia
Originally viewed back in Fall of 1998</PRE>
<P>"Happiness" is one of the richest, darkly complex, and ironically funniest
portraits of American life since "Short Cuts." It is tinged with irony, deadpan
humor, and some severely unpleasant subject matter, though always treated in a
respectful, artful manner by a promising writer-director, Todd Solondz. Solondz
previously directed "Welcome to the Dollhouse," a provocative statement about
growing up in Jersey, but who would have thought he would helm a multi-layered,
disturbing portrait of Jersey like this one.</P>
<P>The film begins with a date at a restaurant. The curly-haired brunette Joy (Jane
Adams) is sitting at a table with a man (John Lovitz) whom she has just dumped.
He questions her, trying to discover why the relationship is over. He shows her
an engraved ashtray, and tells her it's for the person who will love him for who
he is. </P>
<P>Afterwards, we meet the orange-haired Allen (the great Philip Seymour Hoffman),
a guy who masturbates on the phone while arbitrarily picking names off the phone
book and asking the women what they are wearing. Not only does he stalk people
on the phone at home, but also at his office where he works. When he confesses
his explicit sexual fantasies to a therapist, Bill (Dylan Baker), we recognize
boredom is settling on the therapist's face. We hear his thoughts in voice-over.
We see a strange dream where he kills everyone in a playground with a machine
gun. Then he masturbates while looking at teen magazines, and we realize his
true nature: he's a pedophile.</P>
<P>Then we are introduced to Joy's sisters, which include Trish (Cynthia
Stevenson), a bland, perfect housewife unaware of her husband's (Bill's)
clandestine sexual nature, and Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle), a poet who writes about
rapes, and finds that New Jersey is the ideal place to live to prove you're not
a showy writer. 
There is also Joy's unhappy parents, Lenny (Ben Gazzara) and Mona (Louise
Lasser, a long way from "Bananas"). Lenny wants out of the marriage so he can
live his life, yet Mona understandably thinks that it is because of her and that
she's too fat and needs a facelift. When Mona asks for advice from a real-estate
dealer (amusingly played by Marla Maples) about her marriage, the dealer
responds: "Divorce is the best thing that ever happened to me." </P>
<P>Joy needs and wants love desperately, but doesn't know what love is. Her sisters
berate her about their perfect, exciting lives yet she feels cast out of the
family. When not being sexually harassed on the phone (by Allen), she confides
in a thick-accented Russian taxi driver (Jared Harris), who has sex with her and
patiently listens to one of her guitar-playing songs. Of course, he turns out to
be a thief, and is married! </P>
<P>Everyone in "Happiness" has difficulty adapting to their lifestyles, and they
are all inadequate about their loved ones. Interestingly, they all feel a brink
of happiness when they are alone. Allen lives by himself in a bland apartment
and is giddy when making anonymous calls; Joy feels better when playing the
guitar to herself; Lenny can't bring himself to have an affair and chooses to be
left alone; and Bill wants to be left alone with his son's male friends by
drugging everyone with sleeping pills. Only a secondary character named Kristina
(Camryn Manheim), Allen's neighbor, needs solace when she admits her own secrets
to Allen. </P>
<P>"Happiness" is an exemplary combination of flawless writing, directing and
acting. It is shrewdly written by Solondz, and he never makes it easy for the
audience when he wavers between drama and comedy with unusual results. At times,
you don't know whether to laugh, cringe, or both. The most obvious example is
when Bill admits his secret sexual desires to his son - it is so painful to
watch that we are not sure how to respond to it. This is true of Kristina's
secret, which causes one to laugh because it is so unexpected.</P>
<P>The performances are so adeptly attuned to the material that you can't separate
one actor from the other - they fit the roles perfectly. One lasting impression
is left by character actor Dylan Baker (who should be remembered at Oscar time)
as the disturbed pedophile. His face is so haunting and etched with so much pain
that he becomes unforgettable - he also brings a sense of humanity to Bill that
makes it harder to judge him as a person. He tries, in one scene, to tell his
wife that he is sick, yet he can't help his nature. </P>
<P>Solondz has not crafted an exploitative fantasy where the freaks are on display
for everyone to identify - a modern-day Jerry Springer-like movie where the
audience can boo the loveless characters off the screen. Instead, he addresses
these characters as normal, everyday people facing their own crisis, their own
lack of understanding, and their own inability to love. He looks at everyone
with a sympathetic eye, including the pedophile, and cuts deeply into our
consciousness about our human needs. </P>
