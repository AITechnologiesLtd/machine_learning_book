<PRE>AMERICAN BEAUTY
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Over the years, Kevin Spacey has delighted in playing louses:
charming men with hearts as black as pitch.  In his latest film, Spacey is
more a loser than a louse, but his Lester Burnham still maintains some
unpleasant, creepy-crawly qualities.</P>
<P>        For 14 years Lester has been a writer for a crappy media magazine.
He's married, unhappily, to Carolyn (Annette Bening), an aspiring realtor
who lives the image of success even though she's not really all that good
at selling houses.  The Burnhams have a teenage daughter, Jane (Thora
Birch), but neither of them really know her.  Lester, bitter and
unfulfilled at 42, hates his job, which is just as well because he's about
to lose it.</P>
<P>        And, as Spacey's narration informs us at the beginning of the film,
he's not going to make it to 43 either.</P>
<P>        That admission sets the scene for "American Beauty," a dark and
disturbing black comedy with an almost painful emphasis on the black part.
It's a film that revels in the decay and disharmony of suburbia; there are
moments when you think to yourself "things are going to get ugly" before
realizing that things have been interminable from the outset.</P>
<P>        Lester's life is spiraling out of control; unhappiness reigns
supreme.  Then Jane brings home a cheerleading girlfriend one night and
it's lust at first sight (since Carolyn isn't exactly meeting Lester's
needs in that department).  Lester begins to fantasize about Angela (Mena
Suvari) who, of course, is young enough to be his daughter.  Meanwhile, a
camcorder-obsessed boy called Ricky Fitts moves in next door and takes a
shine to Jane, offering to get rid of Lester as a token of his affection
(his father, played by Chris Cooper, is a bigoted Marine who requires urine
samples from his son every six months to ensure that he's drug-free).</P>
<P>        It's not immediately clear whether Ricky (played with stone-cold
credulity by Wes Bentley) is kidding, but as Alan Ball's not very pretty
screenplay unfolds, events soon begin to take more chilling turns.</P>
<P>        The strength of the acting in "American Beauty" keeps everything on
the edge, with Spacey especially good as the frustrated Lester.  Former
Broadway director Sam Mendes makes his big-screen debut with this film, and
it's a good one.  There are times when "American Beauty" feels like it
might be toppling over into melodrama, but Mendes grabs the reins and reels
his actors in, generating power and a lot of perspiration in the process.</P>
<PRE>        "American Beauty."  Life is no bed of roses.</PRE>
