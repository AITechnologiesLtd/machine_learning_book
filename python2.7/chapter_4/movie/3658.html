<P>     Freed from her ADDAMS FAMILY makeup, Christina Ricci gets the 
chance to play a normal teenager--if having a good-natured spook for a 
best friend can be called "normal".  Considering the deserved raves the 
young actress has already received, there's nothing surprising about the 
amazingly mature and nuanced performance she gives, but what is 
unexpected is the manner in which she steals scenes from the multi-
million dollar special effects fresh out of ILM.  Without the talent of 
Ricci, CASPER would have been a truly barren motion picture.  As it is, 
it's still not very good. </P>
<P>     All the adults in this movie treat CASPER like the comic book-come-
to-life it is, and give performances for the under-twelve audience.  
Bill Pullman, normally not much of an emoter, is as two-dimensional as 
the pages in which the ghostly title character first appeared.  Cathy 
Moriarty displays an almost embarrassing--and ultimately 
undermotivated--nastiness, and Eric Idle is underused as a flunky 
whose sole purpose is to provide weak, slapstick-y comic relief. </P>
<P>     CASPER, voiced by newcomer Malachi Pearson, is the product of ILM.  
He's impressive, but not nearly as eye-catching as the dinosaurs from 
JURASSIC PARK.  This film is built on special effects, but executive 
producer Steven Spielberg should recognize better than anyone that 
visual trickery should be used in service of the plot.  Sadly, in 
CASPER, it's the other way around.  We're supposed to gawk at how real 
the ghosts look--who cares if there's a story? </P>
<P>     And there isn't one--or at least not one that matters.  It's 
amazing how this picture got stretched out to one-hundred minutes with 
so thin a script.  Undoubtedly, Ricci's performance has a lot to do with 
making this watchable.  The scenes she's not in become increasingly 
tedious to get through.  Imagine, then, what her presence could do for a 
really good movie. </P>
<P>     Dr. Harvey (Pullman) and his daughter Kat (Ricci) come to a 
decrepit mansion after the good doctor--a "ghost therapist" who offers 
sessions to the "life impaired"--is hired by the new owner (Moriarty) 
to rid the house of its phantom population.  There are four ghosts 
present--the friendly Casper and his three blowhard uncles, Stretch, 
Stinkie, and Fatso.  After initially being scared out of her wits, the 
lonely, motherless Kat befriends Casper and together the two attempt to 
find a way to bring him back to life. </P>
<P>     Clever, funny moments are far between.  There are a couple of 
amusing cameos, including an appearance by a famous ghostbuster and 
quickies by Clint Eastwood, Rodney Dangerfield, and Mel Gibson.  
However, this all lasts about half-a-minute, and Ricci is left to carry 
the rest.  And, no matter how good she is, there's not enough in the 
script.  The potentially-interesting issues--coping with bereavement 
and loneliness, for example--are set aside, presumably because they 
were deemed too "deep" for the younger, target audience.  So, instead, 
we get lots of silliness, including a roller coaster ride sure to be 
coming soon to an amusement park near you.  (Talk about merchandising!) </P>
<P>     In CASPER, director Brad Silberling has filmed an amazingly 
mechanical and lifeless motion picture.  Despite its immense appeal for 
the preteen crowd, the enchantment will likely wear thin for older 
viewers.  In the end, I'm not sure which was the greater struggle:  
Casper's fight against the bad guys or my attempts to fend off boredom. </P>
