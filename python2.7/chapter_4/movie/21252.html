<P>Pirandello might have called it A Dozen Thespians in Search of Love. 
You could also call it Post-Modern Commedia dell'arte, what with 
improvisations, marionettes, and physical comedy. It is also a 
part-time descendant of the Theatre of the Absurd.  Whatever the 
labels, it is most certainly Turturro and Company's love song to the 
theater.</P>
<P>Actor Turturro  had previously directed one movie, also written by 
him and his friend Brandon Cole. That was Mac (1992) which is very 
good, heartfelt but was not circulated widely enough. For sundry 
reasons the 1998 Illuminata was released only recently.</P>
<P>IIlluminata is set in New York City, in 1905. Its multiple focus is a 
single, struggling, probably talented repertory troupe. As they are 
ending their Cavalleria Rusticana -- not the Mascagni opera but the 
1884 play by Giovanni Verga -- they are manoeuvered by their 
playwright-in-residence Tuccio (Turturro) into performing next his 
latest, yet unfinished opus, Illuminata.</P>
<P>What goes on on that stage, behind and around it, defies description 
because of its zig-zags. Brandon Cole's original play was entitled 
Imperfect Love, which sums up matters, more or less. Life and theater 
are juxtaposed, contrasted, equated, complemented. No one is immune 
from stage worship or love in various forms.</P>
<P>The main thread is the love of Tuccio for lead actress Rachel, who in 
real life is Turturro's wife. Young, middle-aged, older people are in 
a constant hubbub which melds (or tries to) the realities of life and 
those of the theater. An extreme case is Christopher Walken as 
despised, feared critic. He is a fop, has hair like a bad version of 
an Oscar Wilde cut, and pursues a younger actor. Everything he does 
or says is funny. Example: "They say I like nothing. It's not true. I 
like chocolate and Caravaggio." Walken's ever-odd appearance, with 
his ambiguous, hairless face, reaches a peak here.</P>
<P>Most of the players are mature, a wonderful relief from teens, babes 
and twenty-somethings. It is wonderful to see older, experienced and 
fine actors like Walken, the great Ben Gazzara, the charming Susan 
Sarandon. She is oddly named Celimene, after the character in 
Moliere's The Misanthrope. (I don't know what is the point of this 
conceit). Their roles are quite unlike their past portrayals. I wish 
Rip Torn were also in the cast.</P>
<P>The women, from ingenue Georgina Cates to Turturro's plump cousin 
Aida Turturro, the lovely Beverly D'Angelo, and of course the 
enchanting Katherine Borowitz, are, each in a special way, "real 
women" and most  appealing. Various situations also bring about a 
celebration of exposed breasts, from A to D cup -- and also give rise 
to some fine farcical scenes.</P>
<P>Turturro, in what we wish were a sign of the times, but is only 
mildly so, marks again the pleasurable notion of cinema not being 
exclusively limited to pretty-boys. Abroad, this happens with actors 
like France's Daniel Auteuil. Not that John T. is ugly here. His 
beard is a flattering argument for not using razors. And his 
intensity shows in his acting, writing and directing.</P>
<P>Too much intensity tends to overwhelm and obscure the plot. I quote 
Turturro: "For me, Katherine's (Borowitz) face and sensibility, 
delicate but strong, intelligent and grateful, and her modesty were 
the inspiration, the soul of the piece. I tried to build everything 
around her."</P>
<P>What a Valentine to a spouse! Let us pray that unlike almost all 
actors, those two will not ever divorce. On the other hand the 
"building of everything" could have used more mortar and 
architecture. Turturro continues: " I looked at Rules of the Game, 
Jean Renoir's masterpiece, read the script of it, and was struck by 
the fact that he was inspired by Georges Feydeau's farces and then 
took that structure to explore serious themes."</P>
<P>As a specialist and admirer of both Feydeau and Renoir, I believe 
that the film does not succeed in this respect. Renoir's very French 
film is a mordant but tolerant satire of French society, from 
celebrities to the idle rich, from old soldiers to new lovers, from 
the ruling classes to their copy-cat servants in an Upstairs, 
Downstairs fashion.. It is all directed with clarity and cool, even 
when agitation reigns.</P>
<P>Feydeau's hilarious comedies spare no one but they are built like 
clockwork so fine-tuned that his plays' extravagant complications can 
be followed without a single "what? who? why? where?."</P>
<P>By contrast, this movie is a maze, a non-stop pile-up of people, 
dialogue --which can drag a bit,-- actions and tributaries to the 
main stream that could, and probably will, confuse you, especially 
since within the limited space of the settings there's no limit to 
the number of scenes.</P>
<P>The settings are very good. So are the photography, the costumes, the 
music and its use. Note that the main music credits go to William 
Bolcom, a major American composer who just wrote the score for the 
opera version of A View From the Bridge.</P>
<P>An oddity of this work is that its entire ambience and context are so 
overwhelmingly Italian or Italianate that some absent-minded viewers 
might miss the references to New York and think it all takes place in 
Italy.</P>
<P>Many scenes  or parts thereof ought to delight spectators. Other 
viewers may have mixed feelings because of the construction. They 
probably wish that Illuminata would illuminate us more than it does.</P>
<P>  One thing is clear to me: Never start an affair with a thespian. You 
will never know (nor will she or he) what is performance and what is 
reality.</P>
