<P>Have you ever seen a movie that, no matter how much you tried to wrap
your head around it after leaving the theater, you just couldn't
figure out what in the world it was trying to say? That you weren't
sure if you liked or hated, merely because you had no idea what it was
really about? Such was my reaction to "Rules of Engagement." As with
most films, it has its good points and its bad points, but in this
one, there isn't a clear dominance of one over the other. The bad
points perfectly negate the good points, and it' s not just a question
of dramatic effectiveness. The themes are contradictory too. Every
time you think you have a handle on the movie's main "point," you
think of something else that contradicts it. The result is a film that
is tough to label as "bad," but is also far from being good.</P>
<P>Col. Hayes Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones) and Col. Terry Childers (Samuel L.
Jackson) are old Marine buddies with a strong connection: Childers
saved Hodges' life in Vietnam. Now old friends, Hodges is retiring
from his career as a military lawyer and Childers is leading a mission
to Yemen, where a crowd of protesters have begun a demonstration
outside the American embassy.  Upon arriving, Childers finds the crowd
much more hostile than intelligence reports had indicated. After
evacuating the ambassador (Ben Kingsley) and his family, Childers
returns to find his troops under heavy fire. He gives them the order
to fire into the crowd. Reports of the shooting reach American
newspapers, and the military subsequently receives harsh criticism for
what the public believes to be a breach of the Geneva convention, an
illegal slaughter of innocent civilians. Looking for a scapegoat, the
scheming National Security Advisor William Sokal (Bruce Greenwood)
places the blame on Childers and plans to bring him up on charges of
murder.  Childers, eschewing an assigned defender, asks Hodges to be
his counsel, despite the latter's assertion that he is a "poor
lawyer."</P>
<P>"Rules of Engagement" is such a contradictory film that a review of it
might be well served by merely listing the good and the bad. So that's
exactly what I'm going to do.</P>
<P>The good: The cast has been very well assembled. Jones and Jackson are
acting powerhouses, interesting by their mere presence. Guy Pearce
does a decent (though strangely chosen) American accent, Bruce
Greenwood is appropriately smarmy (apparently carrying over much of
his smarm from "Double Jeopardy"), and there are good supporting jobs
turned in by Ben Kingsley, Philip Baker Hall, and Nicky Katt. The bad:
These characters are fairly clumsily sketched. The camaraderie between
Jones and Jackson is indicated by a few contrived lines of dialogue
("Your only real problem, Hayes, is that you never lived up to your
father.") and an unbelievably stupid fist fight scene. The supporting
characters get even shorter shrift, with good actors like Kingsley and
Blair Underwood wasted in superfluous subplots that only look like
they're going somewhere. They're not. Anne Archer's part as the
ambassador's wife is so useless, and her few token scenes so riddled
with clumsy dialogue, that she comes off as a bad actress.  Her
attempt to breathe life into the character by hamming it up does not
work.</P>
<P>The good: There are plenty of crackling scenes, most notably the early
battle sequences, one in Vietnam and one in Yemen, that are filmed
with a nice amount of whirlwind action. Director William Friedkin is
clearly taking pages from both Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan" here;
his bob-and-weave camera technique and in-the-action sound recording
create the feel of being in combat nicely. Likewise, some of the
courtroom scenes, however cheesy they may be, are well-acted and
filled with clever dialogue. It's not "A Few Good Men," but for a
bunch of testosterone-fueled speechifying-lawyer stuff, it's pretty
good. The bad: For every powerful scene, there's an equally dead one
to accompany it. There is the aforementioned Jones-Jackson fist fight,
and also any scene involving the ambassador's wife. Then there's
virtually anything in between the opening battles and the courtroom
business.  Every time you think the film might start getting good, it
pulls itself down again quickly, either by drawing scenes out longer
than necessary (Jones spends far too much time in Yemen, considering
how little it all ends up signifying) or by drawing attention to the
stupidity of the characters (I still don't know why the N.S.A. didn't
just release the hidden tape to the public, especially since it seems
to exonerate the U.S. on all counts) or the multiple plot holes. (Why
didn't Childers just fire at the snipers in the first place, anyway?
The Marines had a tactical advantage over the demonstrators.)</P>
<P>But thin characters and plot holes can be forgiven if a film is
genuinely entertaining, as "Rules of Engagement" often is, or if the
film delivers some pointed social commentary. Unfortunately, this film
also runs into problems with clarifying just what its message is
supposed to be. Some reviewers have criticized it for having a
right-wing bent. I can understand how one might see it that way -- the
resolution seems to advance the rather suspect argument that "If you
weren't there in combat, you're in no place to judge." If that's the
case, why have military trials at all? Even so, if we' re supposed to
consider "Rules of Engagement" a conservative film, what are we to
make of the brief, but notable, scenes of Jackson's character losing
his cool? We see that his firing into the crowd may have been
understandable, but that he might have made a better decision by
firing at the snipers. The film seems to reinforce the conservative
argument by painting the Arab characters as liars or needlessly
violent savages, but then what are we to think about the sequence in
which Jones' character visits wounded children in a Yemeni hospital?</P>
<P>Too bad the film ultimately manages to render any debate about the
ambiguity of war useless by painting its characters as obvious heroes
and villains, giving us a thoroughly sappy ending (whose worst part is
the ridiculous "final salute"), and leaving many pressing aspects of
the issue unaccounted for. Perhaps one of the defense's strongest
arguments, that Childers shouldn 't have been sent into such a hostile
area without correct information, isn' t touched upon at all. And what
may be the most pressing question of all seems to have been the most
overlooked: Why was there a protest in the first place? "Rules of
Engagement" isn't a bad film, but it's one that is often too
dramatically and intellectually inert to warrant a full
recommendation.  I suppose "Rules" is entertaining in its own small
way, but it's a very small way.</P>
