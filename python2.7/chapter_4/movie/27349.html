<PRE>"Before Night Falls"</PRE>
<P>Winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the 2000 Venice Film Festival, "Before
Night Falls" tells of the life and the writings of Cuban exile Reinaldo
Arenas. The gay author spent years in and out of Cuba's jails for his
inflammatory prose and poetry before escaping to the United States in 1980.
Javier Bardem plays the persecuted writer and co-stars with the likes of
Johnny Depp, Sean Penn and Michael Wincott in a film by Julian Schnabel.</P>
<P>Javier Bardem does a fine job of portraying the intelligent, talented
Arenas as we follow him, first, as a young man showing an interest in the
written word (and men bathing), and, later, as he garners critical
attention for his first novel. He develops such a following and notoriety
that he comes under the scrutiny of Castro's police and their Russian
masters because of his deviant "capitalist" lifestyle. This begins a tale
of persecution and a personal fight for creative freedom that last up until
Arenas leaves his homeland in the Mariel Harbor exodus of 1980, when Castro
evicted all of Cuba's "deviants, homosexuals and mentally ill" to the
shores of the US.</P>
<P>The tone of the story of "Before Night Falls" is more political and social
in nature, showing Arenas' persecution for his homosexuality and his
politically motivated work. The machismo of Cuba is threatened by the
sexual revolution getting under way in the 50's and 60's around the world.
The oppressive totalitarian government actively tries to subdue this other
revolution with arrests of gays, sending them to cut sugarcane as
rehabilitation. Arenas never gave up, getting his written word out of the
country for publication by any means. At one point he even uses a
transvestite inmate's behind to smuggle out the pages of his latest tome.
(Check out who plays the transvestite.)</P>
<P>The depiction of Cuba, by Schnabel and production designer Salvador Parra,
over the years the story unfolds, is generic and doesn't give the feel that
"you are there." The main means used to show the Cuban location is by
having everyone walking around smoking cigars, even some of the women. The
scenes on the streets of Havana have an obvious movie set feel, pulling
attention away from the action</P>
<P>The screenplay, by Schnabel, Lazaro Gomez Carriles and Cunningham O'Keefe,
brings us, point by point, along the way as we follow Arenas through his
life, his incarcerations and escapes. Once he finally is freed, Arena
spends his last days with a disease we can only guess is AIDS - filmmaker
Julian Schnabel fails to tell us about it, so I can only guess. This kind
of omission detracts from the story, as it requires the viewer to
unnecessarily guess what's going on.</P>
<P>"Before Night Falls" is hopeful tragedy that shows the strength of the
human spirit under adversity. The tragedy is that not everyone is as
courageous and talented as Reinaldo Arenas, who, when he finally escapes
the oppression of Castro, realizes that he has lost his Cuba. Javier Bardem
is solid in his portrayal of Arenas, even if the script is weak. I give it
a C+.</P>
