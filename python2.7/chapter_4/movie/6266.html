<PRE>                              THE RICH MAN'S WIFE
                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1996 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>* (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>There's not much worse than expending mental energy trying to follow and
solve a poorly executed thriller. About the only thing I can think of is
if the film ending lets you know that you wasted your time because it
was all a fraud.</P>
<P>Here we have the worst of both possible scenarios.</P>
<P>Josie Potenza (Halle Berry) is trapped in a loveless marriage  or maybe
it's not: it's hard to tell if even this is true. Because of a pre-nup,
if she divorces her rich husband, she gets none of his wealth and having
his money is an important concern to her. She is befriended by Cole
Wilson (Peter Greene), a creepy psycho, who takes seriously their
conversation in a bar that she could have her husband murdered for the
insurance money. </P>
<P>Maybe this happened; you never know for sure. Remember that sentence
because it applies to everything I will say about the plot.</P>
<P>Wilson kills husband Tony (Christopher McDonald) in what is the only
worthwhile scene in the film. Filmed at night in the rain, he shoots his
prey repeatedly with a gun that continually alternates firing and
jamming. The victim runs, stumbles, is shot again and again in a
frighteningly desperate spectacle. This appears to be a realistic murder
or at least the makings of a nightmare and is wasted in the middle of
what is otherwise a piece of trash.</P>
<P>After the killing, there rest of the film is a torturous slow-moving
mumbo-jumbo of Wilson stalking Josie who seeks help from her lover while
a couple of the stupidest members of the police force try to solve the
mystery.</P>
<P>None of the main actors offer anything that has not been done better in
many other movies. The only stand-out is the ditzy ex-wife (Clea Lewis)
of Jose's lover who livens up the otherwise gray tale for her three
minutes of screen time.</P>
<P>The film is filled with a zillion twists and turns that, in the hands of
a more skilled director and writer, could have been the basis for
something more interesting. In this film, they are just the foundation
for a "Who cares?" attitude as the plot holes engulf the entire movie.</P>
<P>The most disappointing of all is the ending which is obviously meant to
make the audience feel that something clever has been accomplished on
the part of the plot. Instead it completely invalidates everything that
has gone on before.</P>
<P>A despicable story with a cheat for an ending. If you have any
inclination to see this, do anything else (and I mean __anything__ else:
take the dog for a walk, do your dishes, go to the dentist) and youll
have a better time. When the video comes out in about two weeks; rent
it, fast-forward to the murder scene and watch the five minutes of
decent filmmaking and do not succumb to the temptation to view the rest.
Your life will be better for it.</P>
