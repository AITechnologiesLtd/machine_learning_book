<P>When the Titanic went down the ship's orchestra was playing "Nearer My God
to Thee."  You'd half expect the survivors in the disastrous disaster flick
"Daylight" to intone "Nearer Stallone to Thee." They don't, but many
members of the audience may be humming "Nearing the End, Whoopee!" The film
reminds me of the fellow who would repeatedly hit his own head with a
mallet, "because it feels so good when I stop."</P>
<P>In tired old fashion "Daylight" opens with the Motley Group Introduction.
Among them:  a disappointed writer from Indiana who, in her awful apartment
fights cockroaches and rats while getting her manuscripts rejected; a
dysfunctional family of three; a band of evil-looking thugs who hijack the
car of a diamond merchant (he too, for some reason,  looks evil-- perhaps
he's a thief?). There's also Claire Bloom (in the nadir role of her life),
her old husband and their dog, returning from a visit to a canine
psychiatrist (sic); a prison bus transporting convicts; a sportswear
entrepreneur who wastes some of our time in an irrelevant executive
meeting; various Tunnel and Bridge supervisors, including African-American
Vanessa Bell who is also the girlfriend of sweet tunnel cop Stan Shaw. Last
but not you-know-what is El Stallone as a limo driver. His name, Kit
Latura, spelled backwards is Arutal Tik.</P>
<P>What those disparate (and often desperate) people have in common is that
they all find themselves in vehicles going through congested streets.A band
of evil-looking thugs has hijacked the car of a diamond merchant (he too,
for some reason,  looks evil-- perhaps he's a thief?). The ridiculously
ugly criminals drive in a wild, totally unbelievable and incredibly stupid
manner and transform the New York streets into battlefields.</P>
<P>The army of cars, buses and trucks reaches a tunnel connecting Manhattan to
New Jersey. It is unnamed and not identified as its model, the Holland
Tunnel. In this underground/underwater location the stolen car has an
unfriendly encounter with trucks of chemicals. A lulu of an explosion
triggers a series of horrendous disasters, a mini-Hiroshima Holocaust of
flames, toxic air, flooding waters, loose electric cables - you name it,
they got it - which result in gruesomely abundant corpses, twisted bodies
and metal, both ends of the tunnel getting sealed, and the group of the
aforementioned motleys being trapped.</P>
<P>We  learn that Kit Latura (whose anagram is Trakit Aul) used to be the
Chief of   Emergency Medical Services but was disgraced when a wrong
decision by him resulted in the death of some of his men. The details come
out in bits uttered without the clarity of crystal, but no matter. Right
away you get the point:  Kit Latura (or Arial Tukt) must save his
fellow-humans plus the Jungian dog to redeem himself. Which he does.</P>
<P>It's a horrendous task that involves subterranean alpinism, trips (a la
Flash Gordon serials) through enormous, murderous exhaust fans, acrobatics,
immunity to pain and wounds, the strength of Samson,time out for wise
sayings, rats, heroics by Stallone and some others, plus panicked, often
antagonistic men and women who -- you guessed it  -- will become brave and
understanding. There is also a scene of Stallone and his patootie-to-be
trapped in rising waters that are about to reach a ceiling -- straight from
the torture chambers of Emperor Ming, other serials, Fu ManChu and
black-and-white B-movies. There is outrageously obvious religious symbolism
when an exit is found just behind a wooden statue od Christ. As for
Political Correctness, the group will lose two black men, one white male
and one white woman.</P>
<P>The acting is broad. Stallone's inelegant voice and enunciation have not
changed. He seems to be searching all the time for which one of his two
facial expressions to choose. The sounds emitted by things and humans are
loud, speech is rapid, mumbled, often barely understandable except for the
"we're not going to get out of here, are we?" refrain.</P>
<P>All that is bad.With so much junk and overkill, at no time do you believe
the goings-on, feel any kinship, or share any pain in this puppetish movie.
Nor do you learn anything beyond the superficial about the characters, who
all go beyond stereotypes and into caricatures. I was, however, impressed
by those indestructible flashlights that never run down and shine so well
under water.</P>
<P>The Perils of Sylvester are made even more cartoonish since, if I
understand it correctly, the Emergency Medical Service is just what it says
it is. Yet Stallone is not only a fast-thinking acrobat-medic but a
technical savant who knows all there is about tunnels, their complexity and
their disasters.</P>
<P>"Daylight" is a return to the mostly dumb disaster flicks of the 1970s. The
director has stated that the first movie set he ever walked on was "The
Poseidon Adventure," which impressed him, as did soon after "The Towering
Inferno" whose lessons he took to heart when he was trapped on the ninth
floor of a Boston hotel in a fire where five people died.</P>
<P>The aim here clearly is to top those earlier pictures. I admit that its
special effects do just that, with modern techniques: miniatures,
scaled-down sets, computer graphics and other tricks. "Daylight" was shot
in the Italian Cinecitta Studios, with  means and logistics that are
impressive, hence the single star I give it. Otherwise, it rates 5 yawns
out of 5.</P>
