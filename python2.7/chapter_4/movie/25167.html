<P>The word "Tao" has many meanings, one of which is, "The art or skill of
doing something in harmony with the essential nature of the thing."</P>
<P>The Tao of Steve is a story is about a guy named Dex (Donal Logue), an
unlikely hero living in Santa Fe who has grafted this ancient Chinese
philosophy with the super-cool personalities of guys like Steve McQueen,
Steve McGarret, and Steve Austin (though not "Stone Cold"). This
mutation of philosophies has become a foolproof theory on dating that
Dex and his buddies refer to as "The Tao of Steve". In other words, it's
the art of scoring with women while being in harmony with the essential
nature of all things cool.</P>
<P>Back in his college days, Dex was the big man on campus. The consummate
"player," his conquests in the realm of the opposite sex were the stuff
of legends - at least back then. But ten years and about a hundred
pounds later, Dex has become sort of the inside joke at his college
reunion. While trying to pick up a young bartender at the reunion, he
spots a woman named Syd (Greer Goodman) - a motorcycle-riding beauty who
seems immune to Dex's magical powers of the Tao. Through a series of
circumstances, Syd and Dex are thrown together, and he soon finds
himself questioning his belief in all things Steve, even as he continues
to be the ultimate Steve guru.</P>
<P>Donal Logue, best known as the "naughty vampire god" sidekick in the
movie Blade, received the Special Jury Award at the 2000 Sundance Film
Festival for his performance as this once-legendary, now-pathetic
Casanova. His portrayal -- based loosely on the personality of co-writer
Duncan North -- was funny, believable and very well-done. The film is
filled with a cast of first-timers and Greer Goodman -- also making her
film debut -- does a good job of both co-writing and acting in this fun
little romantic comedy. Shooting in New Mexico didn't hurt this picture
either, and the locations used are impressive and filled with color,
which help to create a sense of liveliness within the film.</P>
<P>The Tao of Steve is a funny, insightful little romp through a philosophy
that most people can associate with, eventually settling into a basic
love story. And while Jenniphr Goodman's (not a typo) direction is
pretty basic, it doesn't distract from this being a very entertaining
movie. God bless the independent filmmaker who is free to make a film
not based around demographics or seasonal box office appeal, but on the
value of the story being told. This is the way cinema was intended.</P>
