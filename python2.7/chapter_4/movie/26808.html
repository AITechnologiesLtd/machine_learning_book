<P>Adam Sandler movies are easily an acquired taste--aside from almost all young 
teenage boys, who eat them up--and with every film he makes where he plays a 
normal guy whose ability to make audiences laugh comes from his charisma and 
talent, there are at least two movies that rely on him to be quirky and 
intellectually deficient, complete with a speech impediment. "Little Nicky," 
directed by Steven Brill, falls into the latter, lesser category, as his 
title character walks with a hunched-over back, has a crooked mouth, and, 
yes, a speech impediment. Sandler can be a great comic, but only with the 
right material, and when he doesn't try so hard. Here, he is afforded no help 
by the lame, forgettable screenplay that he cowrote with Tim Herlihy and 
director Brill. Is "Little Nicky" funny? Sometimes. But in the annals of the 
wildly popular Sandler flicks, this one falls into the same league as 1998's 
"The Waterboy"--better than 1995's stupefying "Billy Madison," but not as 
good as 1996's "Happy Gilmore" or 1999's "Big Daddy," and worlds below his 
one great picture, 1998's "The Wedding Singer."</P>
<P>Although he has a wonderful relationship with his father, the Devil (Harvey 
Keitel), Little Nicky (Adam Sandler) is a sweet, good-natured soul who 
doesn't seem to have much of the dark side in him, despite living in hell. 
With his father's 10,000-year reign to the purgatorial throne drawing to a 
close, it is up to him to choose one of his sons to succeed him. The only 
problem is, the Devil doesn't feel like his oldest boys, Adrian (Rhys Ifans) 
and Cassius (Tommy "Tiny" Lister Jr.), are mature enough to handle it, and 
Nicky is far too "heavenly." Adrian and Cassius, outraged at their father's 
decision, escape to New York City and plan to derail all laws, creating a 
Hell on Earth. </P>
<P>With his body already beginning to deteriorate, the Devil sends Nicky out 
into the world above to find Cassius and Adrian and get them to drink from a 
magic-lamp-like flask that will suck and trap them in it for eternity. 
Partnered up with a wise bulldog named Mr. Beefy (voice by Robert Smigel), 
Nicky rents an apartment with an in-the-closet Broadway show fanatic (Allen 
Covert) and begins to search for his brothers. He even meets a cute fashion 
design major named Valerie (Patricia Arquette), all the while starting to 
feel strong emotions he's never felt before. </P>
<P>Aside from the whole Heaven and Hell angle, "Little Nicky" is nearly a carbon 
copy, in terms of plot developments and stock characters, of all of Sandler's 
starring-role filmography. There is always a sidekick or two, with at least 
one of them gay, and there is a token love interest that he has a falling-out 
with due to a misunderstanding, but whom get back together before the end 
credits. There even is a person or two who stand in the way of the main 
character's wants and dreams. While the tried-and-true formula isn't solely 
relegated to movies with Adam Sandler, it is finally beginning to wear out 
its welcome. We've seen all of this before, and done much better and with far 
more charm ("The Wedding Singer"). Here, even the romance between Sandler and 
Patricia Arquette comes off as a slight, unfeeling subplot that isn't given 
hardly any screen time to develop.</P>
<P>With Sandler doing his usual schtick, there is some admitted fun in the large 
supporting players. Arquette, as the mousy Valerie, is winning, but given 
very little to do, while Harvey Keitel and Rodney Dangerfield, as the Devil 
and Lucifer, are very funny. Dangerfield, especially, gets a few zinger 
lines, including a clever placement for his getting "no respect" motto. Jon 
Lovitz, as a peeping tom who dies in the opening scene, left to be sexually 
violated by a giant black crow for all of eternity, is priceless, and his 
brief subplot in the opening is comically superior to anything else in the 
movie. Kevin Nealon, as a demon who grows a pair of buxom breasts on the top 
of his head, is eccentrically repulsive. </P>
<P>Saving the best for last, the effervescently gifted and beautiful Reese 
Witherspoon shows up near the end as Sandler's loving and ageless mother, a 
heavenly angel who hangs out with her Valley Girl-style friends, and steals 
the show. Why Witherspoon agreed to be a part of such a waste of a movie is 
unknown, but for her ten minutes of screen time, she steals your heart and 
manages to tickle your funny bone in a fresh and innocent way. Aside from 
her, the film leaves you feeling oddly unclean with its repugnant premise and 
settings.</P>
<P>Laden with cheesy special effects galore, and not without a seemingly 
required helping of toilet humor and sexual innuendo (Adolf Hitler, for 
example, gets a pineapple showed up his backside while wearing a maid's 
uniform at four o'clock every day as his punishment). "Little Nicky" is 
marginally enjoyable, and not exactly a downright failure, but it is 
uninspired. A divergence for the eyes and little else, the movie has the 
ability to stay with you for about as long as its slim 84-minute running 
time, and then exits from your memory. Not exactly a sign of comedic 
brilliance, or a sign of being that good at all.</P>
