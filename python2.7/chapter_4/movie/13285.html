                The Replacement Killers (18)</PRE>
<P>For a good ten years or so, super cool Chow Yun Fat has enjoyed god
hood status in the Hong Kong Action Scene.  Now, he has followed in
the footsteps of Director John Woo, (who launched Chow's super stardom
in the acclaimed 'A Better Tomorrow') by moving to Hollywood.  I had
some reservations about this move and it would seem I was right to
have them.</P>
<P>Chow plays a hitman who is doing jobs in order to repay a debt.  His
final job requires him to kill a policeman's seven year old boy.  This
he refuses do and runs.  However, he is forced into a violent
confrontation when his family are threatned and replacement killers
are brought in to do the job.</P>
<P>Cue around 80 minutes of various and quite frankly tedious shoot-
outs which take place in various locations.  Some thought had gone
into  making them a bit different but unfortunately they end up being
just plain boring.  The car wash scene, I found myself laughing at how
stupid it looked. Tut tut.  The emphasis during the constant action
seemed to be on the accompanying music, (I could have sworn one piece
was ripped out of a Bruckheimer movie) and not on the content. Mia
Sorvino (a passport forger) is dragged into the affay and also
provides a lame love interest as well as being rather handy with a
gun.  </P>
<P>Director Antoine Arqua has clearly not observed Chow's excellent
acting capabilties and simply requires him to mutter a few lines of
broken english and look flash as he stands and shoots.  Chow's
trademark of twin pistol shooting is saved for the finale (which in
fairness is quite good) and there's not even a toothpick in site. And
as for making Chow shoot like a cop, well that's damned unforgiveable.</P>
<P>To round up, The Replacement Killers is a pretty darned lame first
outing for Chow.  It would appear he has left Asia for a 90 minute pop
video.  This is not what we wanted at all, considering John Woo was
the exec producer. (did he have NO say so at all?)   Watch 'The
Killer' again and weep at the difference. </P>

"There's room at the top, they are telling you still,
but first you must learn how to smile as you kill,
if you want to be like the folks on the hill."</P>
