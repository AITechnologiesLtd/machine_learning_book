<PRE>                                PURPLE NOON
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Thirty-six years after its release, PURPLE NOON is back as part of
Martin Scorsese's revival of underseen foreign classics.</P>
<P>     This time out it's Rene Clement's mystery-drama about wealthy jerk
Phillippe, his adoring (but poor) best friend Tom (Alain Delon), and the
redhead (Marge) they both adore (Marie Laforet).  Caught up in the greed
and envy that comes along with wealth like Phillippe's, Tom hatches a plot
to rid the world of Phillippe and take over his life.  Fine, well, the only
suprising thing about this is how quickly he succeeds at the plan (after
about 30 minutes) -- at which point, the movie becomes one of Tom hatching
part 2 of the plan... and the movie starts to get interesting.</P>
<P>     Tom soon finds his plan to be not quite as well-laid as previously
thought, and it becomes trickier and trickier for him to evade discovery.
Carrying on two lives (Phillippe's and his own), is not for the weak-willed.</P>
<P>     While PURPLE NOON lacks the edge-of-your-seat suspense that modern
thrillers have, it still packs a wallop into its spare story.  But more
importantly, the film is such an oddball example of the genre, we find
ourselves wanting Tom to get away with the crime, despite its heinous
nature.  Very odd indeed.</P>
<P>     My main problems with PURPLE NOON are its tedious narrative and lack
of production values.  Its 1960's sensibilities, crummy music, poor film
stock, and aquatic settings make the film look more like a lost episode of
"Hawaii Five-O" than a great thriller.  Also, the sheer number of "false
endings" (at least three), reek of amateurism.  The subtitles could also
use some work.</P>
<P>     Overall, I enjoyed the film, although it tends to drag in places and
lacks the force of something like BELLE DE JOUR, which Scorsese re-released
in 1995.  Delon and Laforet are/were both fine actors, and Clement's
direction is passable.  Then again, considering the state of the medium 36
years ago, I'm sure he was doing an excellent job.</P>
<PRE>     Why it's called PURPLE NOON is anyone's guess.</PRE>
