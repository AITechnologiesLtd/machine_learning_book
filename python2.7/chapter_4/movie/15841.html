<P>"...and I am an alcoholic."  British director Ken Loach has made a name
for himself for gritty films of social realism, and his latest is no
exception.  Peter Mullan, who won the Best Actor award at this past
year's Cannes Film Festival, indeed gives an award-worthy performance as
the Joe of the title, a recovering alcoholic who falls for a nice and
stable health care worker named Sarah (Louise Goodall).  A romance
between such polar opposites has a number of strikes against it as it is,
but their relationship is further threatened, in a psychological sense,
by demons from Joe's past; and, in a physical sense, by thugs after his
ex-junkie friend Liam (David McKay) and his girlfriend Sabine (Anne-Marie
Kennedy).</P>
<P>The latter threat takes over the film's final act, which is a
wrongheaded turn by Loach and writer Paul Laverty; what had been a
thoughtful, complex, yet subtle character study suddenly devolves into
violent theatrics more befitting an action picture.  Loach and Laverty
are apparently at a loss as to how to recover from that misstep, and the
film abruptly "stops" rather than "ends."  But Loach's keen eye for
unpolished reality (down to the gravy-thick Scottish accents; thankfully
the film, while in English, is subtitled) and Mullan's passionate,
well-modulated turn keeps the film well worth watching.  (opens February
