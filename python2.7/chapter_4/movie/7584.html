<P>     With Hong Kong's approaching return to China's fold, the prevailing 
atmosphere is one of anxiety-tinged anticipation.  Now, more than ever 
before, families are leaving, believing that the uncertainties of 
emigration offer more hope than staying home.  Clara Law's (TEMPTATION 
OF A MONK) FLOATING LIFE, one of many films to draw upon the current 
situation for inspiration, examines the difficulties encountered by Hong 
Kong emigrants.  On one level, FLOATING LIFE is about the experiences of 
the Chang family as they change residence from Hong Kong to Australia, 
but much of what is presented regarding this small group of individuals 
has universal resonance.  Immigrants worldwide will recognize the truth 
in what Law has to say.</P>
<P>     The title refers to one facet of the immigrant experience.  Those 
who live their entire life in one place are said to put down roots, but 
anyone who moves from one country to another loses any sense of 
stability.  With relatives, memories, and all familiar things in a 
different part of the world, immigrants no longer have a fixed point of 
cultural reference; hence, they are "floating."</P>
<P>     The floating individuals in this film are the members of the Chang 
family -- father, mother, and two boys -- who have left Hong Kong to 
live with "second sister" Bing, who is forging a successful career in 
Australia.  While Bing is pleased to have Mum and Pa in her home, she 
lays down a series of stringent rules that her parents find unreasonable 
and oppressive.  Soon, the atmosphere under Bing's roof is one of 
growing tension.  Meanwhile, the oldest Chang son, Gar Ming, still 
living in Hong Kong, is forced to contemplate his future when a casual 
girlfriend becomes pregnant.  And Bing's older sister, Yen, who lives 
with her husband and daughter in Germany, begins to worry that her 
parents might die before she has a chance to see them again.</P>
<P>     Comedy and drama are expertly interwoven throughout FLOATING LIFE.  
For all of the contemplation of death, lost roots, and fractured 
families, this is actually a surprisingly lighthearted motion picture.  
In fact, the movie starts out almost as a farce, and never completely 
abandons its playful tone even when dealing with serious issues.  The 
most important and compelling of these, of course, is the price of 
becoming a part of a new culture.  Those who refuse to adapt will find 
themselves forever looking back, and therefore incapable of moving 
forward.  On the other hand, those who try too zealously to assimilate 
risk losing their heritage, their traditions, and themselves.  </P>
<P>     Two of FLOATING LIFE's many vignettes aptly illustrate Law's 
primary concerns.  In one, Yen plaintively asks the simplest of 
questions:  "Who am I?"  She is caught between two worlds -- not truly 
German or Chinese, with a life that is defined solely by her husband and 
child.  Bing, on the other hand, is determined to become Australian at 
all costs.  But, when she finally recognizes the consequences of what 
she is giving up in pursuit of that goal, her life collapses.</P>
<P>     FLOATING LIFE works because it allows the viewer to feel the 
characters' confusion and isolation.  Most of us are used to looking at 
the immigrant experience from the outside; FLOATING LIFE offers an 
opportunity to observe it from another perspective.  Law's own recent 
experience moving from Hong Kong to Australia serves to heighten the 
film's verisimilitude.  Ultimately, FLOATING LIFE is about the 
importance of balance.  It's a lesson that is useful not only for 
surviving an immigration, but in all dealings with relatives, both near 
and far. </P>
