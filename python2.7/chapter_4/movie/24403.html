<P>When at its best, Gladiator is one of the great films of all time. Every
moment is exhilarating, every fight engaging and every moral and statement
so well thought out and of such a classic nature that they can be
appreciated and pondered simultaneously. However, when at its worse,
Gladiator's two-and-a-half hour length takes the spotlight off the film's
numerous virtues to the point where a slip in the projection gave a preview
audience an unintended intermission necessary to tolerate some upcoming
moments that would make `Wuthering Heights' seem like a page-turner.
Fortunately, the good disproportionately outweighs the bad so much that you
should have no reservations about seeing this film if you want to be
in-the-loop on Oscar night.</P>
<P>The first person onscreen is, appropriately enough, Maximus (Russell Crowe,
setting the bar for this year's Best Actor race), the movie's hero. When we
meet him he is a general at war commanding thousands of troops in the name
of pre-Nero Rome. Like most great war heroes in the movies, Maximus is
humble and wise. His motivation in battle is more to return to his family
than to defend Rome. Although, given the benevolent nature of the empire's
current Caesar, he has no qualms fighting for the great city.</P>
<P>Maximus' skill, bravery and humane qualities are rewarded when he is
informed that he, not the Caesar's son, will inherit the emperorship of
Rome. Yet one of the inherit rules applying to just about all of Hollywood's
great epics is that the kinder the ruler is, the crueler and less loyal his
son. Gladiator isn't an exception. Soon Maximus is no longer a General but
rather a slave and no longer fighting for his family but rather the name of
the great Caesar who once tried to name him his successor only to be
murdered by his blood son that very evening.</P>
<P>Above all else, credit Ridley Scott, the director of the film. And then give
John Mathieson, the deft cinematographer, his due as well. The two brilliant
behind-the-scenes men have created an ancient Rome that few will have
trouble accepting as reality. Thousands of extras are coordinated perfectly
down to the most irrelevant details which only a nit-picky critic like
myself would pay any heed. As for the scenery and backgrounds, to call them
gorgeous would be an enormous understatement – if Dreamworks needs to make
any more money off this film, they should have no difficulty selling
postcards.</P>
<P>Yet surely Scott and Mathieson wouldn't have been able to accomplish this
incredible feat without the aid of a $100 million budget. What does this
tell us about Hollywood today? Perhaps those nine figures are the proof that
although a fluke like The Blair Witch Project will come around from time to
time, enough money combined with the right individuals can create a movie as
marvelous and spectacular as Gladiator. Unfortunately, the large sum
ultimately makes a little too much movie as the creative duo seem to have
gotten caught up in scenery and re-creating the past so much so that they
forget to advance the plot at certain points and instead test the audience's
patience with a craft that belongs in an art gallery, not on the silver
screen.</P>
<P>Gladiator's good guys share a political philosophy of favoring the Senate
over a dictator-like emperor. Many of the more loveable characters also put
their faith in an afterlife as a form of surviving their less-than-ideal
current lives. These issues raise enough debate that Gladiator manages to
achieve its final success by crossing the border from being just another
heroic epic to being a modern-day classic, not unlike Ben-Hur and
Braveheart, even if the film could use some trimming around the edges.</P>
