<PRE>                         THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION
                      A film review by Eric Grossman
                  Copyright 1994 LOS ANGELES INDEPENDENT</PRE>
<P>     Hope and friendship, that is what lies at the heart of THE
SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, a powerful and moving film based on Stephen
King's novella that stars Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.</P>
<P>     In a captivating performance, Robbins portrays Andy Dufresne, a
mild-mannered banker who, despite his ardent pleas, is convicted for
murdering his wife and her lover.  Andy is given two life terms and
sent to Maine's Shawshank Prison, a cold, inhumane place made of steel
and stone.  Morgan Freeman, in another Oscar caliber performance, plays
Red, the twenty-year veteran who can smuggle anything through the
prison walls for money and maybe a few cigarettes.  Red quickly notices
that Andy does not seem to belong at Shawshank, but he likes the young
banker and the two quickly become friends.</P>
<P>     More than prison brutality or prison escapes, both of which are
featured in the film, "Shawshank" is really about the bond that
develops between the inmates.  Andy discovers a group of people who
have buried their hope to maintain their sanity. "Hope is a dangerous
thing," Red explains, but Andy will not give in to Shawshank.  For
years, he writes the Governor twice a week to get funds to expand the
prison library from a tiny, dust-filled room to a place where inmates
can pass their high school equivalency tests.  Andy tries to resurrect
the dreams of those who have, or are becoming, "institutionalized." In
the film, the meaning of the word is intended for those who cannot live
beyond the walls of the prison.  The seventy-five-year-old Librarian,
Brooks (a superb performance by James Whitmore) is so afraid to leave
the prison that he threatens his friend with a knife so that he will
not make parole.  Brooks cannot face the idea of leaving Shawshank, a
place where he is known, respected and has a purpose, for a world that
has long since left him behind.</P>
<P>     While Andy gives hope to the others, he learns from them,
especially Red, to open up emotionally.  Although innocent of pulling
the trigger, Andy feels guilty nonetheless because he pushed away his
wife with his selfishness.  He confesses to Red that had he been more
open, more sharing, she would have neverhad the affair with the
golf pro and hence, would have never been killed Red disagrees, but in
any case, Andy has served his time for his sin.</P>
<P>     While in prison, Andy becomes indispensable to the prison
personnel.  After he saves the brutal Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown)
from paying taxes through the nose, Andy and his friends are given
three beers apiece.  Soon, all the guards are bringing Andy their 1040
forms and to top it all off, the Bible-thumping Warden Norton (Bob
Gunton) has Andy working as his personal accountant.  Red is shocked
when Andy tells him that the seemingly moral warden is as guilty as his
prisoners.  Norton takes money in the form of kick-backs from
contractors competing against his cheap, prison labor.  This adds a
level of irony to the story as the innocent man on the inside becomes a
slave to the criminal who holds the key.</P>
<P>     Writer/director Frank Darabont has made one of the best
adaptations of a Stephen King story to date.  His flowing camera-moves
and sure-handed nurturing of the performances appear to be the work of
a seasoned pro, not someone making his first film.  In addition to the
stars, the cast includes William Sadler, Mark Rolston, and Gil Bellows
as Tommy, the young, naive thief whom Andy takes under his wing.</P>
<P>     Production designer Terence Marsh creates one of the most
important characters in the story, Shawshank prison, and "Barton Fink"
cinematographer, Roger Deakins, gives the film its beautiful but stark
look.  Editor Richard Francis Bruce establishes a steady, deliberate
pace that makes the audience feel the "slow time" of the prison without
boring them.  The authentic costumes are by Elizabeth McBride and
Thomas Newman musical score is a key component to the movie's mood and
emotional impact.</P>
<P>     If it were not for the Academy Awards, we probably would not get
films like this.  Very heavy at times, but overall uplifting,
SHAWSHANK is certain to garner its fair share of Oscar nominations.
The only problem with the film is that with the exception of several
inmates, the Sisters, who like to rape certain inmates, is that it
paints most of the prisoners as decent, likable people.  The audience
is given no sense of their brutality and what they did to be sent to
Shawshank in the first place.  We feel sympathy for these inmates
because of the brutality and emotional starvation they face, but
perhaps we would feel differently if we saw the cold corpse of one of
their victims.</P>
<P>     However, this flaw is not fatal primarily because the film is not
as much about violence and crime as it is about hope and its power to
redeem the human spirit.  Shawshank is a metaphor for our own private
prisons that we trap ourselves in.  Like the prisoners of Shawshank who
have been "institutionalized," we often face the same dilemma of
leaving our private jail cells where at least, we know where we stand.
"Better get busy living, or get busy dying," Red says.  These are words
everyone can learn from, not just criminals.</P>
