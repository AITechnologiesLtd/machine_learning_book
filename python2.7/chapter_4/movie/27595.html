<PRE>                                   PRIPYAT
                        A film review by Julia Levin

<P>The word Chernobyl has become a metaphor not only for the horror of
uncontrolled nuclear power but also for the secrecy and deception of a
collapsing Soviet system, with its disregard for the safety and welfare
of its workers and their families.  When the reactor exploded on April
26, 1986, the explosion instantly killed 30 people.  More than 15,000
died in the emergency cleanup afterwards.  But the real scale of the
catastrophe, which displaced hundreds of thousands of people and
converted villages into ghost towns, turned out to be far greater.</P>
<P>Today, progressive scientists say the effects of that radiation are more
serious than ever predicted.  However, 15 years later, uncertainty still
hangs over the planned closure of the nuclear plant this year, despite
warnings that it is a time bomb.  Of its four Soviet-built reactors,
only number three is still in operation.</P>
<P>For the people who still live in Pripyat, a small town situated next to
Chernobyl, it is both a contamination zone (or a "Zone of Alienation,"
its official title) and a place where they lived, dreamt, created
families, and raised kids.  Prior to 1986, the population of Pripyat was
roughly 48,000.  In 1999, 13 years after the nuclear explosion, the
Austrian filmmaker Nikolaus Geyhalter examines a human face of this
"Alienation Zone" -- the lives of people who returned to town after the
disaster and those who are still waiting to be relocated.</P>
<P>The mood of the remaining elders is grim, but nobody seems to be
particularly shocked.  Although some of them, in the course of several
interviews, clearly understand the initial Soviet cover-up in
acknowledging the tragedy, the majority don't exhibit much knowledge and
choose simply to submit to fate.  One elderly couple shares their family
story -- how they left, got homesick, and returned to Pripyat, where
they live in nearly primitive conditions.  Having nobody to share their
lives with, their days are spent by gathering mushrooms, cooking, and
doing housework.  "The barbwire doesn't stop the radiation, so why be
scared?" they wonder.</P>
<P>Pripyat used to be a lively little town, both a powerful nuclear center
and a conveniently planned city with schools and urban apartments.  It
is now a dead, lifeless stretch of land littered with scraps of the
past: Decaying buildings, gnarled benches of the former sport stadium,
glaring empty spaces.  A solitary lab scientist is the only one in the
film who, when discussing the aftermath of nuclear tragedy, openly
deplores the system for taking measures without also taking social
responsibility and assuring safety.</P>
<P>Other official workers -- the chief operator of the plant's switchboard,
a parking lot foreman, and the checkpoint militiamen -- all appear to be
re-playing half-scared, half-informed pieces of information. 
Technically, the filmmaker's agenda remains objective, if not anonymous:
No voice over or narrator acts as mediator, except when questions are
asked, and no editing juxtapositions are presented.</P>
<P>The film eloquently differentiates the official version of nuclear
tragedy and the meaning of the tragedy for Pripyat inhabitants.  There
is an accidental play on words, a trick I take as a metaphor for the
film's meaning.  One of the interviewees is asked if it makes sense to
guard a huge parking lot containing radioactively contaminated
vehicles.  Perhaps those who surround Pripyat, calling for a
"theoretical renewal of Chernobyl's earth" would know the answer? 
Pripyat is a documentary about a place that officially has ceased to
exist.  It does, however, exist as a living proof of a never-changing
corruption of the Soviet regime, a corrupt legacy which, despite the
fall of USSR, remains omnipresent in this carefully crafted and
deliberately slow-paced documentary.</P>
