<PRE>                           BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>130 min., R, Horror/Drama, 1992
Director: Francis Ford Coppola
Cast:  Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Anthony Hopkins, Keanu Reeves,
       Richard E. Grant, Cary Elwes, Bill Campbell, Sadie Frost,
       Tom Waits</P>
<P>     BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA appears to be a true adaptation of Bram
Stoker's novel.  Keanu Reeves is sent to Transylvania to close a
real estate deal with Count Dracula, Gary Oldman.  Oldman, unknown to
Reeves, is an undead bloodsucker.  Oldman is interested in Reeve's
girlfriend Winona Ryder, and travels to London to get her.  Oldman is
hunted by slightly nutty doctor Anthony Hopkins.</P>
<P>     DRACULA, despite a few technical mistakes, is a very good film.
I feel that it is worth the admission price and well worth going to see
before it leaves the theaters.  On a scale of zero to five, I give
BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA a four.  DRACULA is rated R for female nudity,
graphic violence, and adult situations.</P>
<P>     The film is well written and it held my attention throughout.  I
read the book DRACULA many years ago, so I am not that familiar with
the way the book goes, but from what I could remember, the film seems to
follow the novel.  I was surprised to see that DRACULA is rather
"arty" in many places.  I feel that at least hose of you who tend to
enjoy "art" films might want to go to a matinee of BRAM STOKER'S
DRACULA.   I enjoyed the effect this had on the film.</P>
<P>     The acting in this film was very well done.  Gary Oldman did a
great job as the undead bloodsucker.  He was very convincing in
his role and brings life to the film.  Keanu Reeves (BILL AND TED'S
EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, POINT BREAK, BABES IN TOYLAND [1986 television
film]) is an interesting choice as an actor to portray Jonathan
Harker.  I wouldn't have chosen him as this character, but he does a
great job.  He is on the screen considerably for the first half of the
film, then disappears for the second half.  Winona Ryder (NIGHT ON
EARTH, 1969) is excellent as Reeves' fiancee.  I feel that she is the
major attraction in this film.  Ryder is on the screen the most, I
believe.  Anthony Hopkins gives an average performance as Van
Helsing, the vampire killer.  He neither hurt, nor helped the film.</P>
<P>     The sets that are used for the film are, for the most part, great.
The one part that I really didn't like was the train ride.  I felt that
that looked too unrealistic and cheap.  The interior of the castle was
especially well done, I feel.  I think that the special effects are very
well done.  I liked the look of the 1950s horror films that DRACULA
has.  One of those that I enjoyed the most was the bleeding cross in the
beginning of the film.</P>
