<P>A first time movie director. Nasty rumors of infighting on the set. No
original "Angels" making cameos in the film. What were we to expect? A
disaster, to be sure. A mini-WATERWORLD, if anything. A film that we could
look back at the end of the year and say, "Boy, we saw that dirtball coming
down the aisle months ago, didn't we?" and pat ourselves on the back. But
color me surprised, impressed and above all, entertained...as the angels,
charlie and everyone else involved in this production somehow managed to
take whatever nasty rumors surrounded the film and turn them all into a
harmless hour and a half of fun, fun and another little thing called fun!
Women superheroes? You bet!</P>
<P>PLOT:
Oh, it's that same ol' story. Three smart, tough, sexy women prone to
kickin' ass and solving McGyver-type problems are given yet another
dangerous assignment from their boss, a multimillionaire gentleman whom
they've never met, and proceed to solve problems, kick ass and juggle bad
guys through umpteenth costume changes. Fun is had by all.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A friggin' blast! This movie is a campy, kitshy, funny, action-packed,
bubblegum romp in the sand with three beautiful, sexy, smart women all
playing like they know they're in on one of the funnest movies of the year!
Kick arse soundtrack. Ultra-slick directing. Fun cameos. Cool dance
sequences. Awesome stunts. A cutesy story that doesn't amount to anything
more than a cartoon playing out like a comic book, but you know it's all
good because you're sittin' in your seat, chewing on that popcorn, letting
that butter drip down the side of your mouth and into the pile of cheese
topping off your nachos, and the film just gives you more cheese and more
fun and more kickin' arse, and you eventually realize that the film is just
a heapin' helping of movie fun and if you ain't on their side, then you
ain't in on one of the funkiest rides of the year. Slap Crispen Glover in
there as the ultra-sleek bad guy smokin' like a bad guy should. Sam
Rockwell, confirming his abilities as a solid quirky character actor, and
even Matt LeBlanc, walking around with his tongue firmly planted in his
cheek and getting jiggy with everything that boogies in this movie, and God
knows...it all boogies! Phew.</P>
<P>But honestly, folks, if you're looking for a quick, easy, fun ride for the
evening...something to take your mind of that darn boss back at the
workplace, or that better half of yours who just keeps nagging you about
this and that, grind your gears into neutral, sit back, relax and have
yourself a nice, cool tall one on the Angels and McG. It's been a while
since I've seen a movie have so much fun with itself, but this one is ripe
for the season. It takes girl power, tosses in some Jimmy Bond, a little
Mission Impossible spy mumbo-jumbo, three hot babes kickin' Matrix-type
arse, a rockin' soundtrack, cool cars, a cold-cocking start, some fun credit
outtakes, inside jokes left and right, and makes it all feel sooooo good.
And the girls honestly seem to be having a great time here. Lucy Liu, rock
solid as the most well-rounded angel of them all, smart as a whip, sexy as a
vamp and tough as nails. Diaz, cute as a button, reminding everyone why we
all fell in love with her in THE MASK, and Drew Barrymore, one girl who
should be doubly commended for taking part in the production side of this
fluffy gem as well. One small disappointment was the lack of Bill Murray's
classic scene stealing moments, but surely something to look forward to in
CA2. I've probably over-sold this movie by now, but to be honest, I had a
great time. I guess it's just been a while since I've seen something that
offered such unadulterated enjoyment...and cleavage :)</P>
<P>But if you expect to take this movie seriously, stop right now and don't
bother seeing it. This film is not made for you. It's made for people who
are looking for a punch-across-the-face kinda time, mixed in with a quick
Tequila pick-me-up and a nice, thick, gooey wad o' cheese. If you're that
person, stand in line right now, ask for one ticket for the Angels, and
prepare yourself to be taken through the fun side of the world of make
believe. The Angels...they are deliverin'!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
One of the cuter in-jokes in this film comes by the way of an E.T. poster
slapped against the wall of a playroom in which two young boys meet Drew
Barrymore's character. Of course, Drew will probably always be best
remembered for her part of Gertie in that film.
If you don't recognize actor Sam Rockwell from his previous roles, allow me
to remind you. He plays the nerdy millionaire geek in this film. And last
year, he played the alternate member of the GALAXY QUEST crew (the guy who
always thought he was doomed) and maniac mouse-killer jailbird "Wild Bill"
in THE GREEN MILE.
On top of acting in and producing this film, Drew Barrymore also managed to
slip both her current (Tom Green) and ex-boyfriend (Luke Wilson) into the
activities. Both men have cameo roles.
There were three writers credited with the screenplay of this movie: Ryan
Rowe, Ed Solomon and John August. The latter gentleman is also the man
behind the screenplay for GO.
Director McG's full name is Joseph McGinty Mitchell.</P>
