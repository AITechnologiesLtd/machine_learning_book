JUST LOOKING
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>It was a more innocent time, a time when teenagers weren't bombarded 
daily with sexual images from multiple media sources.  Although it may 
have been a more naive era, it was one brimming with sexual curiosity.  
JUST LOOKING, set in the New York City boroughs in 1955, tells a coming 
of age story about a fresh-faced Jewish kid named Lenny (Ryan Merriman) 
in the summer before he begins ninth grade.</P>
<P>Actor Jason Alexander (George from the "Seinfeld" television series) 
lovingly directs JUST LOOKING with passionate attention to detail.  The 
sets, the cars, the costumes, everything about the production is 
authentically nostalgic.  Well, everything save the cheesiest lightning 
storm this side of an Ed Wood movie.</P>
<P>Lenny is a man on a mission, or given his age, one might better call him 
a boy bound for adventure.  He vows to one and all that this summer he 
is "going to see two people 'doing it' -- no matter what!"  A similar 
story set in modern times would have his ambition be to lose his 
virginity, probably after a surreptitious bout of drinking.  But back 
then, the mere vicarious pleasure of witnessing sex provided more 
titillation than a young teen could even imagine.</P>
<P>Lenny's quest begins when he is sent to "the country" for the summer to 
live with his Jewish aunt (Ilana Levine) and her decidedly non-Jewish 
husband (Peter Onorati).  Leaving his city home in the Bronx, he moves 
all the way to New York City's version of the country -- 133rd Street in 
Queens, which features actual, albeit tiny, backyards and even a small 
and overgrown vacant lot that could serve as a temporary park.</P>
<P>In the sticks, Lenny is invited by neighborhood kids, Johnny (Joey 
Franquinha), Alice (Amy Braverman) and Barbara (Allie Spiro Winn), to 
join their -- now whisper this -- "sex club."  No, it's not at all what 
you think.  It turns out to be something akin to a sex education class, 
but run by students, that is decades ahead of its time.  Although 
obsessed with finding and sharing sexual information -- Alice fancies 
herself a Nancy Drew-style detective -- they would never practice any of 
the stuff themselves, especially since the girls frequently point out 
that they are Catholic, very Catholic.  Alice, who once accidentally 
witnessed her parents having sex when she was 10, describes it to the 
other eager pupils.  It is "like a wrestling match on TV, but they're 
not two men and it's not TV."  Well, that certainly explains it all.</P>
<P>The opportunity to turn their dry discussions into a laboratory course 
comes in the person of a fetching young adult named Hedy (Gretchen Mol).  
She is a nurse who was once an underwear model.  To be specific, she 
wore bras while photographers took her picture for lingerie catalogs.  
Lenny feels like he has died and gone to heaven when he hears about her.  
There is no one whom he would rather catch in the act of doing it than 
the gorgeous and affable Hedy.  The beauty of the story is the way in 
which he ends up abandoning his desire for cheap thrills.  He truly 
comes of age that summer.</P>
<P>JUST LOOKING runs 1:37.  It is rated R for sexual content and language 
and would be acceptable for teenagers.</P>
