<PRE>                          HIGH SCHOOL HIGH 1996
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Jon Lovitz, Tia Carrere, Louise Fletcher, Mekhi Phifer, Malinda
Williams, Guillermo Diaz Director: Hart Bochner Producers: David Zucker,
Robert Locash, and Gil Netter Screenplay: David Zucker & Robert Locash
and Pat Proft</P>
<P>The big failing of 'send up' movies is that they are never as amusing or
as good as the original. Why see 'High School High' when you can have
heartier laughs watching Michelle Pfeiffer, pretend to be a ex-marine,
turned teacher, changing the lives of her pupils in 'Dangerous Minds.'</P>
<P>Needless to say these movies are out to make money. Scraping the
left-over crumbs from the far superior original movies, at whose expense
they make a living. So who are the big suckers of the general public who
are pulled into watching these send ups?  Most probably, those still
hung up about 'Dangerous Minds', or those still longing for more Opus
from 'Mr Holland's Opus', or as clueless as 'Clueless' itself. With the
exception of movie critics who have to watch the movie in order to
review it.</P>
<P>I won't have to say how bad it was, because that goes without saying.</P>
