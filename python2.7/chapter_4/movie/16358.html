<P>It's not just Viagra. Every day, the press reports a new chemical product
that promises long-awaited relief, if not cures. But there are no reports
of the best of drugs for insomniacs: films such as In Dreams.</P>
<P>This movie, ripping off a variety of horror flicks and then adding some of
its own tricks, has a first-class actress (Bening), a capable performer
(Quinn), and the occasionally brilliant Robert Downey Jr. who must
currently be in the process of returning to normal (???) Hollywood life,
after having been in substantial trouble.</P>
<P>Irish-born Neil Jordan is no mean director. Among his films are The
Butcher Boy,  Michael Collins, Interview with the Vampire, The Crying Game,
Mona Lisa, and his early, little seen and underrrated, scary fairy-tale The
Company of Wolves (1984), also scripted by him. How he and his cast  got
involved in In Dreams is beyond me.</P>
<P>In a small, graphic New England town, Claire is a book illustrator, her
latest, in this grim story, being Grimm's Tales. Husband Paul flies 747
passenger planes. Their daughter Rebecca is a cutie. Their dog Dobie does
not look like a Doberman to me.</P>
<P>Claire is suffering from terrible, grim visions which she believes are in
the head of someone else,who in turn is in her head, and which announce
horrible events before they even happen. One such is the disappearance and
the killing of a little girl when a nearby town was submerged to create a
reservoir.  Underwater photography opens the film and regularly punctuates
it, with recurring shots of a church front. I expected, but in vain,
strains of Debussy's La Cathedrale Engloutie (The Sunken Cathedral)</P>
<P>When young Rebecca disappears too, Claire goes into her (Claire's) mind and
out her mind too. Hubby has her hospitalized. What follows are such
incoherent, artsy, over the top attempts to inspire fear and loathing in
New England, that they becomes exponentially soporific. The whole is a
hodge-podge that's filmed with good but irrelevant, industrial-strength
photography, symbols galore, surrealism, Kafkaisms, and all the stuff that
(bad) dreams are made of.</P>
<P>Bening is at center-stage and always good, in spite of the nonsense she is
subjected to, such as (one example among one hundred) the screen of
Claire's computer showing her thoughts. Red (as in blood) is the dominant
color. Red, too, as in apples doing strange and unfriendly things.The
computer, however, is not an Apple machine.</P>
<P>A good actor, Stephen Rea, the specialist in dream psychology, stands
around as if wondering what the heck he's doing in this movie. What's
needed here is an exorcist, since Claire is possessed and (neat trick!)
even watches herself dreaming.</P>
<P>Serial-killer Downey, who is Claire's "control" (her visions are his
thoughts), shows up 20 minutes or less before the finale in a part even
more dull than unappealing. It is politically incorrect  (i.e. gay-bashing)
too as Downey's manner and speech clearly imply homosexuality.</P>
<P>The movie makes no sense, has no heads, tails or anything in-between. It
feels as dull and  as long as watching, these days, Washington, D.C. on
television. Let us hope, fervently, that In Dreams will not add to the
dumbing of the public by giving a boost to the so-called psychics who
pervade the airwaves.</P>
