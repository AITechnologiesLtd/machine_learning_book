<PRE>'Ulee's Gold'</PRE>
<PRE>A movie review by Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>     Peter Fonda turned 58 years old in February and he is beginning to look
and sound more and more like his famous father Henry who died in 1982.  Fonda
has pretty much always taken a back seat in popularity to his sister Jane who
retired from movies in 1990 and today is married to billionaire media mogul
Ted Turner.  Peter Fonda is probably most famous for his 1969 classic film
'Easy Rider' written by Fonda himself along with Dennis Hopper and Terry
Southern.  Fonda starred in that film but his career has been a mediocre one
at best and his daughter Bridget is now carrying the torch for the Fonda
family into the next generation.</P>
<P>     'Ulee's Gold' is a remarkable comeback opportunity for Peter Fonda and
the low-key presentation of the hard driving subject matter is also quite
impressive.  Fonda plays a bee keeper and honey manufacturer living in
central Florida with his two grand daughters and is involved in a friendship
with his neighbour (Patricia Richardson) who happens to be a physician.
 Fonda's son is in a correctional facility after being involved in a robbery
with two other men who maintain contact with Fonda's daughter-in-law and she
is a recovering drug addict as we discover later in the film.  It seems that
while high one night she tells the two men about money her husband stashed
from the robbery and upon his entrance to jail, kept this a secret.  The two
criminals want Fonda to locate the money and hand it over to them.  Fonda is
caught in a moral dilema concerning this crime while caring for the recovery
of his daughter-in-law, raising his two daughters and keeping his business
running.</P>
<P>     This film works because its deliberate slow pace gives the film's entire
tone a hint of reality and Fonda plays the aging bee keeper in a seasoned and
somewhat sympathetic manner.  This is a movie that will find a better
audience on video in a few months and 'Ulee's Gold' is intended for mature
audiences as it is free from the standard Hollywood trappings with a very
ordinary presentation yet powerful message about family and the heartaches
sometimes involved.</P>
