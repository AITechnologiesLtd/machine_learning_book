                               LICENSE TO KILL
                       A film review by Robert Dorsett
                        Copyright 1989 Robert Dorsett</PRE>
<P>     Timothy Dalton's back as James Bond, in what appears to be a mixture of
many plot elements from the *book* LIVE AND LET DIE, the movie THUNDERBALL, and
various "Miami Vice" episodes.</P>
<P>     The plot: Tragedy strikes Felix Leiter, the CIA agent who's helped out
Bond many a time (and who's undergone yet another facelift :-)).  The culprit
is a drug czar.  Bond goes on a revenge trip, accumulating an impressive body 
count along the way (remember, Bond has the license to *kill*, and he uses it 
liberally in this one).  In the process of his vendetta, the Secret Service 
disowns him, which makes for a renegade secret agent, and, for the first time
in the series' history, a plausible cover story.</P>
<P>     Story: mostly sound, almost even believable.</P>
<P>     Dialogue: I saw this at a college preview.  The audience appreciated some
intentionally corny lines.  I'm not sure how well the same lines would come
across in "real life."  "I love James so much"--this from a girl who barely
knows him...  :-)  (That particular scene was a throw-away.)  There are a lot
of very good wisecracks, as well as self-deprecating humor.</P>
<P>     Special effects: some pretty good ones, some very complex.  Unfortunately,
there are continuity problems on some of the more complex effects.</P>
<P>     Stunts: likewise, some very complex ones....</P>
<P>     Gore count: still cartoonland violence, but this flick has the highest 
casualty count in years.</P>
<P>     Characterization: Bond's drifting closer to the "book Bond" than even
Connery did.  He gets really bashed up in this one (although, unlike many a
Bond book, he doesn't end up in the hospital).  The villain's a suitable match
for him,  this time around.</P>
<P>     Product placement: didn't seem very conspicuous.  Of course, a Coast Guard
Dauphin II had a big "Aerospatiale" logo on the side of it, which I didn't
notice when I examined one fairly closely six weeks ago.... :-)  </P>
<PRE>     Cars: mostly American shit.</PRE>
<PRE>     Airplanes: mostly Cessna.</PRE>
<P>     Gadgets: a few.  I get the impression that the gadgets were only
introduced to bring Q on the screen, who's an audience favorite.  It isn't
really a gadget movie, but they do use everyday household appliances (spear 
guns, lighters, airplanes, Stingers) in interesting ways...</P>
<P>     Overall review: one of the best adventure films this summer, and the best
Bond since THE SPY WHO LOVED ME.  Easily on a par with INDY III, and much
better than the summer disappointments (GHOSTBUSTERS II, STAR TREK V, BATMAN).
3 stars (out of four), or a 7.5/10 on the genre-sensitive scale.</P>
