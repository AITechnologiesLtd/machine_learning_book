A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Sam Mendes</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Alan Ball</PRE>
<P>Starring: Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
Upper middle class, suburban family man Lester (Kevin Spacey) realizes that
he is just going through the motions: he is unable to feel passion; he is
soulless, cynical, and no longer able to feel the edge between success and
failure. Everyone else around him has similar symptoms. Lester's
unassertive daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is too lethargic to change her
world, yet all too ready to whine and complain. His wife Carolyn (Annette
Bening) is reduced to keeping up appearances and reciting commercialist
slogans. And these are people with a big house and a decent standard of
living.</P>
<P>The only person who seems able to appreciate beauty and freedom and life is
the person most deprived of it: a dope-dealing teen from across the street
who is practically imprisoned by a domineering, bullying father. When
Lester embarks on a mad scramble to feel the edge again, the fact that he
has quit his job to feel what it's like - - and his newfound interest in
exercise to impress a teenage girl - - ruffle a lot of feathers in the
family. Will Lester regain his ability to appreciate life? </P>
<P>Opinion: 
People say it all the time: you never appreciate good health until it's
gone. Likewise, people raised in fabulously pampered prosperity can become
unhappy and spiteful over the dumbest, most inconsequential problems,
simply because they have no clue how good they have it. Sometimes it takes
a near fall - - accidentally or through deliberate fasting - - to move out
of apathy and reclaim your ability to challenge the world. The
deprivation/appreciation cycle is a major theme of AMERICAN BEAUTY.</P>
<P>AMERICAN BEAUTY is a non-formula, intelligent and articulate movie that
offers fantastic performances by everyone in the cast, especially Kevin
Spacey, who is simply gosh darn amazing this movie. The thing I like about
AMERICAN BEAUTY is that there is no sentimental music, no hospital scene
nor any overly dramatic hokum. The movie entertains and offers brilliant
performances just as is. </P>
<P>If you are in the mood for a thoughtful, non-formula flick, I highly
recommend AMERICAN BEAUTY.</P>
