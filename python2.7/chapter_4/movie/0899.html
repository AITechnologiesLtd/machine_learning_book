<PRE>                                    HAMLET
                       A film review by Laurie Mann
                        Copyright 1991 Laurie Mann</PRE>
<P>     HAMLET is a superbly-produced version of Shakespeare's play, with
strong performances all around.  Zeffirelli catches the look and feel of
medieval Europe very well.</P>
<P>     Zeffirelli's HAMLET opens at the funeral of King Hamlet, and cuts
quickly to a feast, about two months later, when Queen Gertrude has
married her dead husband's brother, King Claudius.  The old king Hamlet
has been almost forgotten, except by his grieving son, Hamlet.  Nothing
can rouse Hamlet from his stupor, and seeing the ghost of his father
unhinges him.</P>
<P>     Hamlet seems unhinged by more than his father's ghost.  The spectre
of sex also unhinges him.  He's torn by his feelings for Ophelia, his
feelings for his mother, and his convictions that his mother has
dishonored his father.  His madness is more than just a mask---he's
loosing it early in the film, and spends the rest of the movie loosing
it.</P>
<P>     Mel Gibson gives a fine performance as Hamlet.  I particularly
liked Helena Bonham-Carter, who gives a really strong performance as
Ophelia.  Ophelia comes off as a very weak woman in most productions of
HAMLET, but in this version you can hear the passion in her voice.  Glen
Close and Alan Bates portray Queen Gertrude and King Claudius as
love-sick adolescents, but it works very well.  And Ian Holm is
sufficiently dottering as the advice-giving Polonius.</P>
<P>     In HENRY V, Kenneth Branagh kept the frame of a theatrical
production around the film, by starting the movie on a sound stage and
keeping the Chorus (Derek Jacobi) in the film.  Zeffirelli completely
divorces Hamlet from theater, and opens up the play by adding a few
short scenes that had only been described in the original.  While I tend
to be a purist about original material,  the additions keep true to the
spirit of the play.</P>
<P>     My only reservation about the movie is that Gibson's performance is
a little erratic.  His early scenes of madness are a tad too wild-eyed.
He is brilliant late in the movie, particularly in the climatic scene
with Gertrude.  However, Hamlet is a tough role to simply "act" in; it
requires a theatrical performance.</P>
<P>     It's rated PG-13.  I'm not sure why--the killings aren't
particularly brutal, there isn't much in the way of bad language, and
the sex is only implied.  (Actually, the "country matters" speech was
said somewhat more laciviously than I'd seen before, and Hamlet attacks
Gertrude in an almost rape-like manner.)  Our ten-year-old begged to go,
so we took her.  Unfortunately, she was rather bored by it.  (I forgot
to note earlier that she enjoyed AWAKENINGS, but is now worried about
getting encephalitis!)  If your pre-teen wants to go, you might suggest
they watch Zeffirelli's ROMEO AND JULIET on tape first, to see if they can
follow it.</P>
<P>     HAMLET is definitely worth seeing on a big screen.  There are some
lovely sweeping shots that will get lost on TV.  It's also worth paying
full price for.  I'd give it an 8.</P>
