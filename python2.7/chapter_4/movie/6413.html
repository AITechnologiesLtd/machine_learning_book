<PRE>                             I'M NOT RAPPAPORT
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<PRE>               Do not go gentle into that good night,
               Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
               Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
                                -Dylan Thomas</PRE>
<P>     Herb Gardner is the Tony award winning author for the play "I'm
Not Rappaport."   Ten years after it appeared on Broadway, Gardner
brings it to the theaters with total control.  He is the producer,
writer, and director of the film version.  This is not necessarily good
in that the major suffering of the film is that it has play stamped all
over it.  Plays are in-person experiences that happen in intimate
settings.  Films take place on a much larger scale.</P>
<P>     Gardner does take his play outdoors, but the cinematography by
Adam Holender (SMOKE) fixes the camera immovably on the talking heads
for insufferably long periods.  This causes the wit and humor of the
play to come across all too often as the pedantic ramblings and sermons
of a couple of old men.  The beauty of the language does come through,
but the net effect of the movie is to make the viewers wish they had
gone to the play instead.</P>
<P>     As the story opens, Ron Rifkin (LAST SUMMER IN THE HAMPTONS and
the soon to be released THE SUBSTANCE OF FIRE) is speaking to the fur
workers' union.  The year is 1909, and thanks to some help from a woman
in the audience, he calls for a general strike.  After a quick cut to
the present where the restaurant workers are on strike, we meet one of
the two leads in the story, an 80 year old ex-Communist organizer named
Nat (Walter Matthau).  As the Communist Internationale plays in the
background, Nat drones on with tired dogma about the proletariat, but
no one takes him seriously.</P>
<P>     When he goes to a grocery store and starts marking down food he
deems overpriced, people look upon him as a savior more than a kook.
Everybody that is except the owner who wants to throw him out when he
begins to suspect that Nat is not from the Mayor's office of consumer
affairs as he claims.</P>
<P>     Every day Nat meets his acquaintance Midge (Ossie Davis) at a
bench in Central Park.  Midge views him as a pain and his incessant
conversations and stories as little more than verbal harassment.</P>
<P>     Being tired of hearing Nat has returned from the dead or that he
is a deep undercover Cuban secret agent, Midge tells him to stop lying.
"Lies, not lies -- alternatives.  Sometimes the truth doesn't quite
fit," argues Nat.  "I was one person for the first eighty years.  Why
not a hundred for the next five?"</P>
<P>     Most of the show is about old men raging against the dying of
their light.  When Midge stands up, he falls down.  Nat takes this
philosophically as it does with everything in his life, reflecting,
"It's the system.  Two years old, you stand up.  Seventy years later,
you fall down again."</P>
<P>     There are some interesting images in the picture.  The best is
when they both sit on a bench with a bronze statue of a suit talking on
a cell phone.  With one on each side of the immovable man, they smoke
dope and admire an attractive stranger, Laurie (Martha Plimpton).  Each
of them fantasizes her as being a woman from years ago in their past.
Later in the film, they will come to Laurie's aid when she gets in
trouble with a drug dealer named The Cowboy, played against type by
Craig T. Nelson.</P>
<P>     The long scenes of banter in the park undoubtedly worked well in
the play.  In the film, they are too long and preachy.  More lively
editing or camerawork would have helped.</P>
<P>     Midge finds that Nat drives him crazy, complaining, "Lord, I asked
for help, and you send me a weird Commie blind man."  I find that
Matthau's acting frequently annoys me, but in this film I loved his
work and that Davis's.  I empathized with them both.  Two convincing
performances.</P>
<P>     Less effective is the supporting cast.  There is nothing wrong
with their performances, but they provide little more than window
dressing in this two person play.</P>
<P>     Boyd Gaines plays a jogging character named Danforth who does have
a single good line: "Truth is I hate running.  Being immortal takes too
much time."  Now, I know why I gave up jogging twenty years ago.</P>
<P>     Nat puts everybody down.  He warns Danforth, "One more word, and
I'll make a citizen's arrest for crimes against the language."</P>
<P>     If you like to watch for goofs, you can see the boom appear quite
clearly twice in the famous "I'm Not Rappaport" joke sequence between
Nat and Midge.</P>
<P>     "Everybody else got a two wheeler when they turned ten, I got a
paperback copy of Das Kapital," carps Nat's daughter Clara Gelber (Amy
Irving).  Most movie goers get entertainment, but I got a talky play
masquerading as a movie.  If you can get past the stilted filming, the
film has a message worth hearing.</P>
<P>     I'M NOT RAPPAPORT runs too long at 2:15 because the play was not
effectively adapted into a movie.  It is rated PG-13 for dope smoking
among the geriatric set.  There is a little profanity and some
violence, but no sex or nudity.  The film's attitude about drugs makes
me suggest that the film be seen only by kids who are over twelve.  I
found the filming frustrating, but I liked most of what the movie had
to say so I am recommending it and giving it ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
