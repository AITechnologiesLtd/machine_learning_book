<PRE>                                 BLUE CHIPS
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Nick Nolte, Mary McDonnell, J. T. Walsh, Anfernee "Penny" Hardaway,
           Shaquille O'Neal, Matt Nover.
Screenplay:  Ron Shelton.
Director:  William Friedkin.</P>
<P>     There may be only one thing in this world that I know better than
movies, and that would be college basketball.  For every two hours that
I spend in a theater, I probably spend four in a gym or watching hoops
on television.  I spent a lot of time in BLUE CHIPS picking on the
details, but that wasn't only because I felt I knew the details; it was
also because there isn't all that much detail to be found.  BLUE CHIPS
is a morality play drawn in big broad strokes, with a message that can
be summarized in two words:  "Cheating *bad*."</P>
<P>     Set at a fictional California institution called Western
University, BLUE CHIPS stars Nick Nolte as Pete Bell, head basketball
coach at Western.  Two championship banners hang in the rafters from
Bell's tenure, but a point shaving scandal three years back has
tarnished the program's reputation and resulted in fewer prime
recruits.  In an effort to turn around a losing team, Bell tries to
bring in three potential stars:  Chicago guard Butch McRae Anfernee
"Penny" Hardaway); Indiana farm kid Ricky Roe (Matt Nover); and
untrained physical specimen Neon Bodeaux (Shaquille O'Neal).  Standing
in the way is Bell's sense of ethics, since it appears that he'll need
to break recruiting rules and pay off the athletes to get them to
Western, a dilemma which doesn't seem to trouble a wealthy alum (J. T.
Walsh).</P>
<P>     The problem facing BLUE CHIPS from the outset is a tone bordering
on the terminally naive.  Screenwriter Ron Shelton (BULL DURHAM, WHITE
MEN CAN'T JUMP) approaches the subject of big money in collegiate
athletics as though he were the one blowing the whistle on it.  "Can
you believe this?" he seems to be saying.  "It's not just a game any
more!"  The film revels in self-congratulatory outrage, leaving its
characters to founder undeveloped.  Nolte's Bell is a purist who just
loves the game, but he's too shiny a knight, and his final, pedantic
speech to a group of sportswriters is just sloppy.  J. T. Walsh plays
Happy, the fat-cat athletic booster, as an absurd stereotype, and Mary
McDonnell plays Bell's ex-wife as a recycled version of her spirited ex
from SNEAKERS.  There is the potential for an interesting conflict when
O'Neal's Bodeaux exhibits a reluctance to buy in to the same ethic as
his teammates, but Shelton and director William Friedkin seem reluctant
to give any of the novice actor-athletes too much to say.  They also
seem unwilling to ask any of the hard questions about collegiate
athletes, such as whether or not they actually deserve some sort of
compensation.  Every choice is the obvious one and the wrong one, right
down to an awful "conscience" voiceover during the climactic game.</P>
<P>     BLUE CHIPS could have saved itself by getting its basketball
right, but there are a basket full of problems there as well.  The
on-court action is fairly bland, and photographed from all the wrong
angles.  Friedkin makes no particular effort to make the setting seem
collegiate, with crowd shots focusing on politely cheering alumni.
However, two gaffes particularly irked me.  In the first game, with the
margin twenty points in the last minute, every seat in the stand was
still filled; I suppose it would have been tricky telling half the
crowd to leave when rumor has it that tickets for the filming were
being scalped for $100.  Then, in the final game, the crowd reaction
comes far too slowly given the result, and doesn't seem remotely
authentic.  It's too bad Shelton couldn't have brought the same feel to
the hardwood that he brought to BULL DURHAM's dugout.</P>
<P>     There are a few things to like about BLUE CHIPS.  Nolte is
perfectly cast as a coach, and O'Neal and Hardaway are pleasant
surprises.  I was also amused by the inclusion of ousted coaches Lou
Campanelli and Jerry Tarkanian among the gaggle of competitors pursuing
Bell's prized recruits.  They are, however, small consolation.  BLUE
CHIPS' puffed-up indignance wears thin quickly.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 blue chip recruits:  3.</PRE>
