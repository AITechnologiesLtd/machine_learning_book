<P>Starring Woody Allen, Sharon Stone and Gene Hackman
Directed By Eric Darnell and Lawrence Guterman
Running Time: 1 hour 42 minutes.</P>

<P>Dreamworks latest picture, after Small Soldiers, is another children's flick.
And again, like Small Soldiers, most of the gags will probably go right
over your kids head. Woody Allen plays 'Z', a neurotic worker ant in a
massive ant colony. By a chance encounter, he meets and falls in love with
Princess Bala (voiced by Stone.) They split company, but Allen wants to meet
her again, so he convinces a soldier ant voiced by Sylvester Stallone to
swap places with him, so he has a better chance of meeting the princess
again. However, he manages to get both himself and the princess in a variety
of adventures in the outside world.</P>
<P>Like Toy Story (1995), Antz is completely computer generated by a company
called PDI, and looks brilliant. The graphics are superb, witty and easy on
the eye. There are literally hundreds of details in every scene. Although
the ants look like they are made out of wood, they move and act perfectly.
The voices behind the ants are excellent also. Woody Allen makes Z
completely hilarious, and although his angst may seem slightly out of place
in this movie, it's toned down from his previous work (although he somehow
manages to get erotic fantasies into the script.) Stallone is also good, and
the teamwork between Allen and Stallone is great, playing each other off
perfectly. Gene Hackman and Christopher Walken as the evil Soldier leaders
bring an edge to the movie, and Dan Ackroyd, John Mahoney, Jennifer Lopez
(as Stallone's lady) and Danny Glover (good as an ill-fated soldier ant) all
play a part in bringing to life the characters. The only weak link is Sharon
Stone, who seems to give no effort to her performance. Being a major
character in the film, this is slightly annoying to adults, although
children will probably not care.</P>
<P>The film is directed well, although it is much easier to direct on computer
when you have full control of what happening. The battle scenes are
excellent, the romantic scenes are well handled and not too sickly, and the
comedy is well done aswell. It's hard for a Woody Allen film not to be funny
however (apart from Scenes From A Mall.) Also, the wild visuals always make
sure that the film is a delight to watch. Although the script is
occasionally cliched, and there's the occasionally slow bit, Antz will
probably not be sending you to sleep.</P>
<P>The main flaw with the film, though, is that it's a little too adult for
kids, but a tiny bit childish for adults. Woody Allen's comedy is really not
for young ones, but the look and feel of the film is certainly aimed for
children. There's also a smattering of bad language in there for no apparent
reason, and Z talking about erotic fantasies is clearly out of place in this
movie. Generally, however, Antz is an unexpected delight. A Bug's Life, the
new film from Toy Story creators Pixar, has quite a bit too live up to.
Worth a look.</P>
