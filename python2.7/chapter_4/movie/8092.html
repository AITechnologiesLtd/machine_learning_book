<P>Shine
Chad'z rating: ***1/2 (out of 4 = very good)
1996, PG-13, 105 minutes [1 hour, 45 minutes]
[drama]
starring: Geoffrey Rush (adult David Helfgott), Noah Taylor (teenage David
Helfgott), Armin Mueller-Stahl (Mr. Peter Helfgott), Lynn Redgrave (Gillian),
written by Scott Hicks, Jan Sardi, produced by Jane Scott, directed by Scott
Hicks.</P>
<P>You don't have to be a musician to understand the power music can have. It's
something so forceful it rivals love. "Shine" proves this to be true as it is
a story of a gifted pianist torn between his loyalty and honor to his father
and his love for his music. The film's most moving element is not the drama,
but the music itself.</P>
<P>As the film opens we meet an eccentric man wandering in the rain, he is the
main character, David Helfgott as an adult (Rush). Through a series of
flashbacks we are told the story of how he came to be where he is now. As a
small child he displayed a great ability for playing the piano. He enters a
talent competition and although he amazes everyone, he does not win first
prize. Later, one of the judges stops by his house to give him a "special"
prize, but this insults his Orthodox Jewish father, Mr. Peter Helfgott
(Mueller-Stahl) because he is essentially given a prize for losing. Mr
Helfgott is a Holocaust survivor, he refuses handouts, and teaches his
children, "Only the strong survive."</P>
<P>Most of the first half is plotless, however, many events occur to create for
detailed characterization and atmosphere. Some of these things are short and
subtle, but really add up, such as a scene in which David (played by Noah
Taylor from age 14 - 20) flirts with a girl but his father purposely calls
him away. Other examples include: when David's sister crawls through a hole
in the fence to talk to a boy, Mr. Helfgott seals up the hole; and when David
tries to get back at his father by ruining his bath, he is beaten. I find
family conflict and domestic violence to be some of the most powerful,
dramatic elements in cinema, and this film makes perfect use of them. </P>
<P>The love/hate relationship between David and his father reaches a boiling
point when he is offered a full scholarship to a musical college in London.
David decides to go even after his father threatens to completely disown him.</P>
<P>I never thought I'd see a parallel to "Star Wars" in a film such as this,
but a Luke Skywalker/Obi-Wan Kenobi type of relationship seems to form
between David and his new teacher at college. The teacher describes the power
of music in such a way it seems supernatural - music becomes to David what
The Force is to Luke Skywalker. </P>
<P>There are many wonderful scenes in which David's musical ability speaks
volumes on its own, but could it be too much for him to handle? His entire
life has revolved around the piano, and it finally catches up with him as he
suffers a mental breakdown after performing his best concert ever.</P>
<P>The second half of the film is quite strange and jumbled. Geoffrey Rush
delivers an outstanding performance as a mentally challenged adult David, but
the film doesn't give much explanation to his condition. Then again, an
explanation nor a plot is really necessary from this point on, as it becomes
a simpler story about David's day-to-day struggle for happiness.</P>
<P>David starts playing the piano again and many things start to happen in his
life. He meets a woman named Gillian (Redgrave) and they get married. David's
father also makes an appearance in a typical coming of terms scene - but has
he finally forgiven him? It's difficult to tell, but I think that's the
point. In fact, most everything that happens during his adult life is open to
interpretation. The scenes themselves are easy to follow (and quite funny at
times), and it seems something monumental is going to happen.</P>
<P>The only thing I didn't like about "Shine" was the sudden ending and the
choppy storytelling throughout the second half. But despite these minor
flaws, the film works as a good and original drama that combines the power of
music with the human spirit. </P>
