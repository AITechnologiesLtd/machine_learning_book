<PRE>Hercules
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4) I skipped the last two Disney features because I
thought they looked exactly like the previous four - beautiful
adolescent heroes, nonbeautiful comic-relief sidekicks, simplistic
morality, and a song here and there. </P>
<P>Looks like I should have skipped this one too. </P>
<P>If you have kids and feel obligated to see this movie, go right ahead.
It is a clone of all the Disney features since THE LITTLE MERMAID. You
know exactly what you're getting into. If you're like me - looking for
something original or fresh, then you can probably skip this one. </P>
<P>The story is a Disneyfied version of Hercules. Lots of the details are
wrong (see <A HREF="http://net.indra.com/~mmapes/her_gz97.htm">http://net.indra.com/~mmapes/her_gz97.htm</A>), but the basic
story is about right. Hercules is the mortal son of Zeus, but he has the
strength of a god.  Brave Herc decides to become a hero and sets out to
prove himself by fighting all sorts of nasty monsters. Eventually, he
gains the notice of a jealous god (Hades, not Hera) whom he must later
confront. This being Disney, there is of course a love interest, Megara. </P>
<P>As usual, the only character that's not white bread with mayo is the
villain. James Woods steals the show as a very show-businesslike CEO of
the underworld, complete with flaming blue hair.  </P>
<P>Of the songs, two stand out: one because it's bad, the other because
it's good. "Go the Distance" is a thankfully short gaggy schmaltzy
you-can-do-anything number, and "Zero to Hero" accompanies a packed
montage of heroic feats and mythological references that actually might
merit a second viewing. Parents who feel obligated to buy every Disney
movie shouldn't mind seeing that sequecne the first 15 times. There's
probably a lot there. </P>
<P>One final note deserves mentioning; the credits zoom by at an unusually
high speed. Most people walk out during the credits anyway, so the crawl
speed really shouldn't matter. Nevertheless, the credits rocket upwards
insultingly fast. A lot of people worked very hard to produce HERCULES,
and they deserve better.</P>
