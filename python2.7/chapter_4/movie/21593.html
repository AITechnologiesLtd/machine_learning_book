<P>starring Linda Fiorentino, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Chris Rock
written and directed by Kevin Smith</P>
<P>Linda Fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded
turn in the cable pic The Last Seduction, and her being cast as
Dogma's lead is nothing short of inexplicable. She's still in fine
form as Bethany, an abortion clinic worker who's lost her faith. One
night, a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in Bethany's
bedroom. He is Metatron (Alan Rickman), the voice of God, and he needs
her help: she must stop two fallen angels from entering a New Jersey
church-the fate of the universe depends on it. God would do it
Him/Herself, but He/She is...missing, having taken up human form
somewhere on Earth never to be heard from again.</P>
<P>Bethany is joined on her road trip to the Garden State by the
"prophets" Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith, doing
double-duty), the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of
Smith's films thus far. At some point, Rock drops naked out of the sky
as Rufus, the undocumented (and very black) "thirteenth apostle", and
offers his assistance, as does divine stripper Serendipity (Salma
Hayek). It's a wild ride.</P>
<P>They're in pursuit of Loki and Bartleby (Damon and Affleck,
respectively-this is probably the sharpest either has ever been), who
were banished from heaven to Wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic
loophole that will enable their return. Loki decides to wreak havoc
along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the
pearly gates. At one point, he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits
with an angry combination of words and bullets. It's a nasty, guiltily
enjoyable little scene that asks, "How corrupt are you?".
Wings of Desire this ain't.</P>
<P>Since debuting with Clerks, Smith has grown as a director,
particularly in terms of working with actors. (Chris Rock is this
film's only weak link-between jokes, he's wooden.) His no-frills
visual style hasn't changed much over the years, though (Dogma's
widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations), nor
has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one
caustic, hilarious speech after another. Dogma chips
away at big religious issues-namely, the hypocrisy that accompanies
any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately, but a few
of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition. As well, the
verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever.</P>
<P>Any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time
maintaining momentum (Hurlyburly, anyone?), and eventually Dogma's
pacing goes slack. A long diatribe from Bartleby late in the game, in
which he laments the destiny of celestial beings, comes at a point
when we've heard enough. Because his change of heart (Bartleby is
initially the good cop to Loki's bad) drives the climax, said rant is
given a great deal of screen time. Sure, Affleck deserved a big moment
(Damon steals their scenes together prior), but it ultimately makes
the film and us feel bloated.</P>
<P>Like Tarantino, Smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad
indie filmmaker. Dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch
of movies, including Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, with Silent
Bob doing his best Harrison Ford, and Weird Science-a shit demon
attacks our heroes! Smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour: his
dexterous maneuvering between the satirical (a Cardinal played by
George Carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan
"Catholicism Wow!") and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of
comedy will leave Dogma feeling malnourished. I bust(ed?) a gut on
several occasions. Proceedings also get off on the right foot with the
opening with the funniest disclaimer ever.</P>
<P>It's a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease, for to read it,
one actually has to see Dogma. The prerelease ballyhoo is in the
tradition of The Last Temptation of Christ's, Martin Scorsese's
1988 adaptation of Nikos Kazantzakis' controversial novel, in that it
is not directly linked to the picture's content but to rumours and
heresy. There's a famous anecdote about Fletch director Michael
Ritchie inviting picketers of The Last Temptation of Christ into a
screening on his dime, just so they could know for certain what they
were rallying against. (Not one of them had watched it.) Every single
person refused.</P>
<P>Smith and Scorsese have a lot in common, and so do the two films in
question, because both Smith's Bethany and Scorsese's Jesus are hollow
shells without their faith. In fact, Dogma's denouement (which follows
a thrilling showdown that's worth the wait) is a Catholic love-in, a
veritable recruitment poster. (I felt sentimental about a religion I
don't belong to. Now that's powerful filmmaking.) Smith is nothing if
not sincere about his own devotion to God, and that spirituality
shines through. It's enough to make me forgive Dogma for its editorial
sins.</P>
<P>My religion is movies. When the Catholic League beats on Dogma
for imaginary crimes against a doctrine, in a roundabout way they're
attacking what I live for: freedom of expression through celluloid. I
therefore feel that, although I'm no Bible-thumper, I'm at least as
qualified to criticize Dogma as William Donohue and his followers.</P>
