<PRE>                              DEEP IMPACT
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Nature does not pull its punches, and
          DEEP IMPACT pulls far fewer than most similar
          films, stretching most of its believability in the
          last reel.  This is for the most part a very
          plausible and frightening film with real characters
          working out real problems in the face of a threat
          of cosmic proportions.  DEEP IMPACT is a very
          promising film from the new production company
          Dreamworks (and from Paramount). Rating: 8 (0 to
          10), low +3 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     We have had a long period in which special effects have driven
science fiction films rather than characters or ideas.  Last year's
CONTACT was a very good science fiction film with three-dimensional
characters. DEEP IMPACT is the first of two major theatrical films
(along with at least one TV movie) inspired by the Shoemaker-Levy
comet's impact on Jupiter and speculation of what if it had been Earth
that had been hit.  At least in plot and ideas the film is highly
reminiscent of George Pal's classic WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE.  However the
emotional texture of the film also has some of ON THE BEACH.  For the
admittedly small sub-genre of films about celestial impacts on Earth
films--not forgetting METEOR--this is likely to remain the best.</P>
<P>     Teenager Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood) sights a celestial body that
just should not be where he sees it.  He reports his finding to
professional astronomer Marcus Wolf (Charles Martin Smith).  Wolf
confirms that indeed it is a new comet.  But Wolf also discovers it is
on a collision course with Earth.  A year passes and TV news reporter
Jenny Lerner trips on something very secret going on in Washington.
There seems to be a serious sex scandal, one sufficient to cause the
Secretary of the Treasury to resign.  In Washington any sufficiently
well kept secret is indistinguishable from a sex scandal.  Jenny wants
to get the goods on the Secretary of the Treasury and instead stumbles
onto what is accurately called the biggest story in world history.  The
United States and Russia are secretly cooperating on efforts to avert
the disaster that is coming our way in the form of Comet Wolf-
Biederman.  The story moves back and forth among multiple story lines.
Morgan Freeman plays a President of the United States whom the script
uses mostly just to make major announcements.  Spurgeon Tanner (Robert
Duvall) is a crusty ex-Apollo astronaut on a mission to destroy the
comet.  But he has a strained relationship with younger astronauts on
the same mission.  Leo Biederman must come to terms with the new fame
he has received having his name associated with a deadly menace to his
planet.  And Jenny Lerner is resolving her relationship with her
separated parents.</P>
<P>     The chief problem with DEEP IMPACT is that two hours is really
about a third of what would be needed to do the story realistically and
cover most of the parts that should be told.  That seems to imply TV
mini-series.  But it requires the wide-screen to do justice to the
visual aspects of the story.  Certainly in the early parts of the film
it seems to be rushing through what is just an outline of what the
story should be.  Much of the story goes by in a very superficial
manner.  Interesting and some sometimes spectacular scenes are left out
that would inevitably take place if a comet were headed for earth.
Cooperation is reached between two country's space agencies.  Huge
projects that dwarf the Manhattan Project occur off-stage.  While in
the plot there is hope for some people and not others, one would expect
great rioting by those less fortunate.  This is only hinted at.  While
human reactions are much more believable than they were in WHEN WORLDS
COLLIDE, they are still far from convincing. We see only frustratingly
sketchy details in a headlong rush to get to still meatier parts of the
story.</P>
<P>     Still the film has a real credibility that is broken only in the
semi-optimistic final reel.  The emphasis of the script is on people
and not special effects, though when the film calls for effects, they
are there in force with some very nice sequences.  DEEP IMPACT and
CONTACT are evidence that the science fiction film is not just for
thrill-hungry teenagers.  It can tell a story on an adult level and
convincingly take us places we have never been and in some cases may
never again want to go.  I give DEEP IMPACT an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a low +3 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
