Susan Granger's review of "THE CELL" (New Line Cinema)</PRE>
<P> Cinema is defined as "the art of motion pictures" and, for
director Tarsem Singh (best known for R.E.M.'s "Losing My Religion"
music video), the emphasis is on art.  Jennifer Lopez stars as a
pediatric psychotherapist who is involved in an experimental research
program, working with a youngster in deep coma, when she's recruited
by an FBI agent (Vince Vaughn) to delve inside the mind of a
schizophrenic serial killer (Vincent D'Onofrio) in hopes of saving his
most recent victim (Tara Subkoff). It seems the diabolical,
voyeuristic killer kidnaps young women, tortures them in an
underground tank, drowns them, and finally bleaches, slices and dices
their corpses while watching videotapes of their suffering as he's
suspended by hooks in his back, simulating weightlessness. This
gruesome, thoroughly repulsive journey inside the landscape of a
perverted patient's mind is made even more perilous since the
empathetic therapist risks losing contact with reality. The sadistic,
repetitive child abuse theme of Mark Protosevich's screenplay lacks
psychiatric plausibility. And with her seductive, whispery voice and
gallons of pink lip gloss, pop-culture diva Jennifer Lopez is hardly
credible as a virtual reality expert, serving instead as a shallow,
ultra-chic fashion model doing perfunctory posing in a chaotic
dream-world. But the daring, obsessive fantasy is amazing. Tarsem
Singh's vision combines David Cronenberg with Salvador Dali, Federico
Fellini with Heironymous Bosch - with a bit of "Hellraiser" thrown
in. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Cell" is a visually
arresting but deeply disturbing 6. If digital design and stylized
symbolism intrigue you, go to this unpleasant but meticulous
mindtrip. But be aware that it's style over substance, amounting to
less than meets the eye.</P>
