<P>         After months of debate in the media over its supposedly
sacrilegious content, it's sort of bewildering to discover
writer-director Kevin Smith's "Dogma" is not an all-out attack on the
Catholic church but rather a rambunctious satire which ultimately turns
out to be an endorsement of faith. Is it irreverent and crude? Of
course, but what else would you expect from the man who made "Clerks,"
the first film to win an NC-17 rating purely on the basis of its
dialogue?</P>
<P> In "Dogma," Smith (who professes to have been raised a
Catholic) asks some of the same kinds of questions you might expect to
hear from a precocious child after Sunday School. Did Joseph and Mary
ever consummate their marriage after Jesus was born? Did Jesus have
brothers and sisters? Why does the Bible skip over what happened to
Jesus between the ages of 12 and 30? As you might expect, the answers
Smith comes up with are, to put it lightly, a bit unorthodox. But he
takes pains to warn his audience about what's coming in a disclaimer at
the beginning of the film, asserting that "even God has a sense of humor
-- just look at the platypus."</P>
<P> At any rate, anyone who's likely to be offended will probably
bail out on "Dogma" in the first ten minutes, right around the time a
cardinal (played by George Carlin, for heaven's sake) unveils the new
"Catholicism Wow!" campaign which promises "a renewal of faith and
style." The centerpiece of his press conference is the unveiling of a
statue of a grinning Jesus offering a thumbs-up sign to his followers.
The cardinal dismisses the old image of the crucifix, insisting "Christ
didn't come to Earth to give us the willies."</P>
<P> That bit sets the tone for a meandering tale about the race to
stop fallen angels Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) from
re-entering Heaven, a feat which would prove God's fallibility and bring
on the end of existence. Linda Fiorentino plays Bethany, an abortion
clinic worker who's astonished to find she's the one hand-picked by God
to prevent this calamity, especially since she's obviously a bit
spiritually conflicted. She attends Mass dutifully, but joylessly and
confides to her co-worker Liz (Janeane Garofalo) she thinks God is dead.
"The sign of a true Catholic," Liz cracks.</P>
<P> Before long, Bethany will be joined in her crusade by Jay
(Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith), the duo who've become Smith's
answer to Laurel and Hardy after their previous appearances in "Clerks,"
"Mallrats" and "Chasing Amy." Although they score a few scattered laughs
this time around -- particularly when they reveal what lured them from
New Jersey to central Illinois -- the pair's shtick is beginning to wear
thin, and "Dogma" might have been a more focused film without them.</P>
<P> Much more entertaining company is provided by the muse
Serendipity (Salma Hayek), who's currently visiting the Earth in the
guise of a stripper who does her act to New Edition's "Candy Girl," and
Rufus (Chris Rock), who claims he was the thirteenth apostle and was
left out of the Bible because he's black. Smith has given these
characters many of the script's choicest and most provocative lines.</P>
<P> "Dogma" is practically bursting at the seams with ideas, some
of which Smith puts across with considerably more finesse than others.
He gets a delightfully dry performance from Alan Rickman as the
underappreciated seraphim Metatron who berates Bethany for not
recognizing him. "You people -- if there's not a movie about it, it's
not worth knowing," he growls.</P>
<P> Smith also proves Affleck and Damon are good sports (and able
comedians) by working in a few jokes alluding to the rumors about their
off-screen friendship, and even manages a couple of nasty swipes at
writer-director John Hughes by having Serendipity claim credit for have
inspired 19 of the top 20 films of all time. The sole exception is "Home
Alone": "Someone sold their soul to Satan to get the grosses up on
that." James Sanford</P>
