<P>SHE'S ALL THAT
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: **1/2 (out of ****)
Miramax / 1:37 / 1999 / PG-13 (language, sexuality)
Cast: Freddie Prinze Jr.; Rachael Leigh Cook; Matthew Lillard; Paul 
Walker; Jodi Lyn O'Keefe; Kevin Pollack; Elden Henson; Kieran Culkin; 
Anna Paquin; Usher Raymond; Kimberly "Lil' Kim" Jones 
Director: Robert Iscove 
Screenplay: R. Lee Fleming Jr. <HR>The "Clueless"-esque vernacular that makes up the title of "She's All 
That" pretty much guarantees an audience composed of hip, young things 
who know a "whatever" from an "as if." Forgive the film for not aspiring 
to greater ambitions, but if every new wave of high schoolers must have 
a contempo movie to call their own - and if every couple years of cinema 
must see another retread of the "Pygmalion" route - then the ordinary 
but overall pleasant "She's All That" fills the void satisfactorily. 
Just don't expect many successful new twists on a classic formula, 
because this flick couldn't be more straightforward if it were a TV 
newscaster reporting on the day's events. </P>
<P>A familiar story is spun under a fast pace and little else, true, but at 
least award "All That" a bag of chips for exuding endless charm and 
enthusiasm out of a cast of hot up-and-comers. The particularly 
appealing lead performers here are Freddie Prinze Jr. ("I Know What You 
Did Last Summer") and Rachael Leigh Cook (the infamous "This is your 
brain on heroin" commercial), respectively well-cast as popular jock 
Zack and nerdish outcast Laney, senior schoolmates in sunny So Cal. 
Taking a cue from "My Fair Lady"'s Henry Higgins, a bet is suggested 
that Zack can't turn Laney into the class queen with just eight weeks 
left until the prom. He accepts and pursues. She scratches her head at 
the sudden attention. </P>
<P>It's a given that this star-crossed twosome is going to fall in actual 
love, especially after she snips off her weird hairdo and trades in her 
frumpy overalls for a hot little red number. The source of suspense then 
hinges on whether or not Laney will learn of the unfortunate wager, and 
if so, whether or not there's still a happy ending waiting in the wings 
for our mismatched protagonists. Like, duh. The results of this 
eventually sticky dilemma is just as paint-by-numbers predictable as 
everything that comes before it, a shortcoming that wouldn't be as big 
if "She's All That" had supplanted the mechanics of its ho-hum narrative 
with more real imagination and wit. </P>
<P>Still, there are plenty of lively elements discovered amongst the 
clutter, and chief among them are the deft actors. "Scream"'s Matthew 
Lillard is a scream as a pugnacious former star of MTV's "The Real 
World" who plays a central but secondary role in the Zack-Laney 
courtship; Paul Walker ("Varsity Blues") and Jodi Lyn O'Keefe 
("Halloween: H20") also have fun with their villain roles even as they 
fail to make much sense. And the unexpected tweaking of seemingly 
"ordinary" moments also provide welcome distraction, like a nicely 
choreographed dance sequence, numerous jabs at pop culture and the 
running commentary of a campus deejay (R&B star Usher Raymond) that 
seems to function as a Greek chorus. </P>
<P>The eventual sum of honest goodies like these elevates "She's All That" 
to a standing more notable than, as teen entertainment goes, at least 
half of the WB's hit youth-oriented programming. (And speaking of the 
WB, "Buffy" fans will adore that the Slayer herself, Sarah Michelle 
Gellar, contributes an amusing, wordless cameo. Talk about a movie 
counting on its target viewers.) Even the film's broad attempts to 
satisfy all tastes end up creating an oddly amiable combo of fairy tale 
ambitions, coarse potty humor and quite a bit more. It's like planning 
to go to the prom with Mel Gibson, getting Mel Brooks for some of the 
evening, and wanting to stick around to see how things turn out.<HR>© 1999 Jamie Peck

"Now you'd think that Karla the roommate would figure out that since 
Julia has been living for two years with terrifying nightmares, and 
since most of her friends and neighbors have been filleted by the 
Fisherman, it would be unwise to sneak into her room in the dark, make 
suspicious noises and hide in the closet. Roommates do not think like 
this in slasher movies." -Roger Ebert on "I Still Know What You Did Last 
Summer"</P>
