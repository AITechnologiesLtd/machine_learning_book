<PRE>                                    CLUELESS
                       A film review by Anthony E. Wright
                        Copyright 1995 Anthony E. Wright</PRE>
<P>     This ain't Shakespeare, but CLUELESS has several audiences in
mind.  Teenagers and those who still identify with them should enjoy
and perhaps even identify with some of the characters.  Outsiders to
teenage and/or California culture will feel "as if" they are on an
anthropological exploration.  Jane Austen fans will enjoy the clever
update of their favorite author's novel EMMA.  CLUELESS is a silly, fun
movie.  Yet those looking for social satire should stick to the book.</P>
<P>     Alicia Silverstone, 18, known primarily for Aerosmith videos,
plays the lead role, Cher Horowitz, with glee and a glint of mischief.
She's a Beverly Hills high school babe, rich and popular, good yet
shallow.  There's none of the awkwardness that defines teenage life,
only supreme confidence.  Yet the characterizations of cliques, petty
disputes, and obsessions ring true, and will resonate with anybody who
is still (god help them) in the throws of adolescence.  (Cher amusingly
praises how considerate her best friend Dionne and her boyfriend are to
each other--"when nobody is looking.") This movie also has the one
necessity for a teen-cult film: Great lines.</P>
<P>     In fact, this might qualify as one long "Saturday Night Live"
sketch (a good one, though), with the reliance on such
caricature-making lines, from "As if!" to the desire to be a "Betty" or
a "Baldwin." However, while this give-and-take has some wonderful
moments, the real power of this film is the cumulative effect.  Those
who might mock Valley-Speak with an occasional "Omigawd!" should
beware that *the entire movie* is spoken in such parlance.  Writing the
dialogue for this movie was probably as hard for the Bronx-raised Amy
Heckerling as speaking in Klingon ... yet by the end I believe in it as
a form of communication.  Even the most cyncial adults should enjoy
this celebration(?) of California teenage culture.  The directing is
savvy, from a hysterical L.A. freeway scene, which lets us experience
firsthand how a learner's permit driver reacts to a tractor-trailer
behind her, to the idea of a phone being transformed into the 2001
obelisk, complete with """""Thus Spracht Zarathrustha.</P>
<P>     Critics looking to pan a teenage film normally rely on the
"Where's the plot?" crutch.  That's usually a good call, but here, the
writers have Jane Austen as a defense.  The movie takes virtually every
plot device from EMMA, to the point of even calling one character,
Elton, by the same name.  Austen fans will enjoy how clever this
adaptation is done: paintings become photographs, balls become raves,
live-in family friends become ex-stepbrothers, and fireplaces become,
well, electric fireplaces.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the social satire that this films offers is that perhaps,
as Jane Austen chronicles, we as a culture were always this ditzy, this
shallow, this clueless.  This is all the social commentary there is,
except for the obligatory making fun of the extremes of Beverly Hills
high school's inhabitants, with their constant nosejobs and cellular
phones to talk to each other in the hall.  This film could have had the
potential to contain strong Heathers-like satire, but it stayed at a
satisfying uber-Beverly Hills 90210 level.  No message, but a fun and
goofy summer movie.</P>
