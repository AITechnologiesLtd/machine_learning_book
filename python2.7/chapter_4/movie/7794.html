<PRE>                               THE PILLOW BOOK
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     "I need writing," insists the beautiful Japanese woman Nagiko
(Vivian Wu) to a stranger in the cafe.  "Don't ask why.  Just take out
your pen and write on my arm."  And rest of her body as well.</P>
<P>     Nagiko's obsession is finding a calligrapher who is as good a
lover as a calligrapher, and for her, skin is the medium of choice.
("I like the smell of paper - all kinds," she confides in her diary,
called a pillow book.  "It reminds me of the scent of skin.")</P>
<P>     Peter Greenaway's audacious assault on our senses is called simply
THE PILLOW BOOK.  Greenway is a cinematic stylist whose best known film
is perhaps the movie with the enormous title of THE COOK THE THIEF HIS
WIFE & HER LOVER.  (Yes, he did not allow commas to impede his
thought.)</P>
<P>     Greenway in recent interviews has been railing against the power
and the homogeneity of American movies.  His films are certainly like
no others.  In THE PILLOW BOOK, which he wrote, directed, and
co-edited, he creates a sumptuous movie in montage.  Most scenes make
heavy use of picture-in-picture techniques, thus making the movie
screen look like some feature laden television.  Part of the film is
shot in letterbox with a larger black band at the bottom holding the
English subtitles.  This asymmetric letterboxing is a projectionist's
nightmare.  Ours almost got tricked.</P>
<P>     The bizarre story can be followed if you pay close attention, but
it is merely a sideshow.  The movie exists to show off calligraphy on
skin as an art form and to dazzle the viewers with sights and sounds.
The best part of the film is the music by Brian Eno.  A mixture of
Chinese, Japanese, and French music.  All of it has a haunting beauty.
The French folk songs have subtitles that flow by sing-a-long style in
order to focus the audience on the music.</P>
<P>     The story is a conundrum but with periodically interesting
vignettes.  The reoccurring one, which various characters repeat, tells
an ancient legend of God making clay models.  "If God approved of his
creation, he brought each clay model to life by signing his own name."
>From this comes the tradition of writing on people's torsos.</P>
<P>     Most scenes are off the scale, any scale.  Typical is the one
where Nagiko's lover Jerome, played by Ewan McGregor from EMMA and
TRAINSPOTTING, has a solution for Nagiko for the publisher who is
ignoring her.  Nagiko will write her book all over Jerome, and he will
go to the publisher and strip so the publisher can see the beauty of
her writing.  It gets even more ludicrous once Jerome gets naked in the
publisher's office.</P>
<P>     The film sets a record for the number of shots of male frontal
nudity in a non-pornographic film.  None of the scenes are erotic and
only a few are meant to be.</P>
<P>     Besides the ridiculous story, the movie's other problem is the
acting.  The actors do not try to be convincing, and the director seems
happy to have them all on autopilot.  He approaches the film stock as a
canvas upon which he will paint a beautiful and shocking portrait.
Narrative has little importance to him.</P>
<P>     THE PILLOW BOOK would make a wonderful short film.  Trimmed down
to twenty or thirty minutes, I could easily praise it.  As is, it
becomes an incredibly long exercise in style.</P>
<P>     THE PILLOW BOOK runs an exhausting 2:06.  It is not rated but
would probably be NC-17 as it contains large amounts of complete nudity
as well as explicit sex and one scene of drug abuse.  The film is in
English, Japanese, Mandarin and Cantonese with English subtitling where
appropriate.  Although I was impressed by parts of the filmmaking, I
cannot recommend the picture.  I give it ** for its impressive and
unusual sights and sounds.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
