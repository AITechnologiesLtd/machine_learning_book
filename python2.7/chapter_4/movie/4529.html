<P>     By the time THUNDERBALL, the fourth in the "official" James Bond 
film canon, was released, the "Bond Formula" had already been perfected.  
It goes something like this:  take the suave 007 (always impeccably 
dressed and ready with a witty one-liner) and add several beautiful, 
scantily-clad women, at least one exotic locale, a few neat gadgets, 
multiple polished action sequences, a megalomaniac villain, and a 
musical score by the inimitable John Barry. These elements, taken 
together, made Bond a huge success in the 1960s and have kept him riding 
a crest of financial profitability for more than three decades.</P>
<P>     THUNDERBALL is from the team that brought all the early Bond 
adventures to the screen:  lead actor Connery (as 007), director Terence 
Young (who also helmed DR. NO and FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE), longtime Bond 
screenwriter Richard Maibaum, cinematographer Ted Moore, title sequence 
designer Maurice Binder, and composer John Barry.  THUNDERBALL proved to 
be the most popular Bond of all, topping UK and US box offices in late 
1965 and early 1966.  The film was so well-received, in fact, that it 
was remade some 18 years later as NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN.</P>
<P>     As THUNDERBALL opens, SPECTRE is again on the move.  This time, the 
mission -- to blackmail the United States and Great Britain -- is headed 
by Number Two, Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi).  The plot he has masterminded 
involves stealing two nuclear weapons, then threatening to blow up a 
major city if the two countries don't pay the ransom.  After the threat 
has been issued, M (Bernard Lee) calls in the "00" agents and assigns 
them to tasks around the world with the goal of finding and stopping 
Largo.  007 draws Nassau, where he encounters old friend Felix Leiter 
(played this time by Rik Van Nutter), Largo's lovely mistress, Domino 
(Claudine Auger), and a host of deadly adversaries.</P>
<P>     At two and one-quarter hours, THUNDERBALL runs too long.  Certain 
sequences could have been trimmed, especially the climactic underwater 
battle, which seems to take forever.  The villain of the piece is a 
little weak, coming in the wake of such memorable adversaries as Dr. No 
and Goldfinger.  While Adolfo Celi is suitably menacing, he plays Largo 
like a high-placed thug.  There is some compensation for the 
deficiencies of the lead villain, however.  It comes in the person of 
femme fatale Fiona (Luciana Paluzzi), whose sophisticated, black widow-
like personality makes her more dangerous than any male SPECTRE agent. </P>
<P>     Of all his Bond performances, Sean Connery seems the most 
comfortable here (not that he was ever uncomfortable).  With three 
movies behind him and two more yet to come, Connery was in the midst of 
a career-making, successful run.  His screen version of the superspy may 
not be what Ian Fleming envisioned when he first put pen to paper, but, 
by the release of THUNDERBALL, the actor had left his indelible imprint 
on the role -- a characterization that none of the performers following 
him has been able to equal.  The 007 of the books is different from the 
007 of the movies, and Sean Connery is James Bond for the film-going 
audience (with apologies to George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, 
and Pierce Brosnan).</P>
<P>     The underwater sequences, which are choreographed and directed with 
great skill, are THUNDERBALL's standout feature.  Connery is more often 
in a bathing suit than a tuxedo here.  A fair amount of time is spent 
beneath the ocean's surface, and, down in Neptune's realm, the 
photography (by Lamar Boren) is clear and the action sequences are 
invigorating (when they don't seem to last forever, that is). 
THUNDERBALL is classic 007 -- not the best picture in the long-running 
series, to be sure, but a more-than-worthwhile diversion for the action-
loving escapist in us all.</P>
