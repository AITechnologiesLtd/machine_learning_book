<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>The world is not enough indeed.  The latest James Bond flick falls as
flat as Tomorrow Never Dies, with decent action sequences and bad soap
opera acting.  Here, 007 (Pierce Brosnan, The Thomas Crown Affair) tries
to quell – get this – a terrorist with a nuclear warhead.  Yawn - now
there's something we haven't seen before.</P>
<P>The nineteenth film in the longest-running series in the history of
cinema kicks off with the familiar JB opening and music before settling
in Bilboa, Spain, where Bond is calmly dealing with a crooked Swiss
banker.  Of course, the situation comes to a head, and Bond is involved
with an impressive boat chase that not only runs through the streets of
London, but wraps up on a hot-air balloon before launching into the sexy
opening credits and new 007 song from Garbage.  Why do songs from Bond
films always sound the same?</P>
<P>Bond's initial assignment is to recover money stolen from a Sir Robert
King, which leads him to become involved with King's leggy daughter
Elektra (Sophie Marceau, Lost & Found).  Elektra is currently building a
huge oil pipeline in her native Azerbaijan, and Bond believes that her
life may be threatened by a devious terrorist named Renard (Robert
Carlyle, Plunkett & Macleane).  Renard, previously a target of MI6, has
a bullet lodged in his medulla oblongotta, which renders him unable to
feel pain.</P>
<P>As goofy as that sounds, Bond also gets involved with a buxom nuclear
physicist named Christmas Jones (Denise Richards, Drop Dead Gorgeous, in
a bit of awful casting).  But wait until the point in the movie where
they say that Elektra is only twenty-one.  If she is twenty-one, then
Dr. Jones must be around thirteen.  On the plus side – other than
getting to watch two attractive women try to act – there are two
fantastic one-liners about Christmas' name at the end of the film.  I
was getting nervous that the screenwriters dubbed her `Christmas' and
forgot to make fun of the name.  Jones is Bond's third lay of the film,
after Elektra and the MI6 doctor Molly Warmflesh, whom 007 poles in
order to regain his active duty status.  He probably just missed a
fourth in Il Postino's Maria Grazia Cucinotta, but she escaped his
sexual grasp in the film's opening.</P>
<P>The script is another example of a bad action film with too many
writers.  Sure, all the bad double-entendres and one-liners are still
there, but what was the deal with John Cleese (The Out-of-Towners)
playing the successor to Q (Desmond Llewelyn)?  You almost feel sorry
for people as talented as Robby Coltrane (Message in a Bottle), who
again plays Valentin Dimitreveych Zukovsky, and Dame Judi Dench, who
reprises her role as M in a healthy supporting role with more screen
time than her Oscar-winning turn as Queen Elizabeth in Shakespeare in
Love.  And as soon as you see Denise Richards in a white tank top, you
know that chilly water will figure into the film at some point.</P>
<P>Directed by Michael Apted (Extreme Measures), Enough was filmed by
Adrian Biddle (The Butcher Boy) on location in several European
countries.  The action scenes are barely enough to keep viewers
interested (aside from the early boat chase) and the final fight between
Bond and Renard is completely anti-climactic.  You would expect Bond in
a battle against a guy that can't feel pain to be a lot more
interesting.  But, then again, you would expect the whole film to be a
lot more interesting.  I've had Enough.</P>
<P>2:08 - PG-13 for intense sequences of action violence, some sexuality
and innuendo</P>
