<PRE>.                            THE SWEET HEREAFTER
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1997 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     It's been over two years since Canadian auteur Atom Egoyan first came to
my attention with his breakthrough film EXOTICA.  Since then, I've become
something of an aficionado of his works through home video, and it was with
breathless anticipation that I awaited what was sure to be the movie that
pushed him into the mainstream: THE SWEET HEREAFTER.</P>
<P>     Maybe I over-hyped it in my mind, becoming too hopeful in the face of
overwhelming praise for the film.  Or maybe I know Egoyan's tricks too well by
now.  Either way, I left the film extremely pleased but depressed: partly
because the movie is such a downer, and partly because I know Egoyan can do
even better.</P>
<P>     This time around, Atom uses his multiple time-line storytelling to relay
the events surrounding the tragedy when a school bus careens off an icy road
in a sleepy town in the Great White North.  When lawyer Ian Holm swoops in to
build a negligence case against the bus manufacturer and the city, he becomes
the unwitting agent as the revealer of the dirty secrets that everyone within
seems to hide.</P>
<P>     It almost sounds like David Lynch territory, and without his trademark
glorious revelation--a scene the binds all the characters' lives together and
which Egoyan traditionally ends his films with--it almost is.  Instead of
pumping up the mystery, Egoyan has opted for a slower pace of gradually
revealing the secrets behind the facade... something that probably makes the
film more accessible to the masses, but is less pleasing on the whole.  Then
again, Holm is in the role of his life here, and the movie is absolutely worth
seeing if only for his performance.</P>
<P>     Don't get me wrong.  THE SWEET HEREAFTER is a *riveting* film, one that I
encourage you to see, as long as you aren't feeling suicidal, as it really is
deeply depressing.  At the same time, I also urge you to check out EXOTICA,
CALENDAR, and THE ADJUSTER on home video.  If nothing else, you'll come out
feeling normal, no matter how nuts you really are.</P>
