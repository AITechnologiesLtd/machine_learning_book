<PRE>Little Nicky </PRE>
<P>Adam Sandler's latest flick has him playing the son of the devil. Must.... 
resist.... obvious.... one-liner. </P>
<P>But seriously folks I'm starting to think Mr. Sandler must be the most 
powerful person in Hollywood because every celebrity on the planet is willing 
to appear in his movies no matter how bad they are. Technically, "Little 
Nicky" should be his worst movie to date because it is so unabashedly 
commercial and outrageous, but it's not. </P>
<P>Sandler's style of comedy is directly responsible for a lot of the humor we 
see on TV and in the movies today. It's the "lowest common dominator" 
philosophy multiplied by stupidity. He's crude and lowbrow but he's also 
using ideas most others aren't. He'll do pretty much anything for a laugh and 
he never expects you to take him seriously. That worked back in his debut 
starring vehicle "Billy Madison" and it still works here. </P>
<P>As I mentioned before, Sandler plays the son of the devil, Nicky. Actually, 
he's just one of the devil's three sons and he's the "good" one. A goofy guy 
with a speech impediment and a wacky face who doesn't really comprehend what 
it means to be part of the evilest family in existence. Harvey Keitel plays 
Satan who's trying to decide which of his sons will succeed him. But since 
he's the devil he of course chooses himself which irks the two really nasty 
sons Adrian and Cassius who flee Hell to set up camp on Earth. That screws up 
everything, the devil begins to "die" and Nicky is the only one capable of 
capturing his two mean brothers and making sure Hell stays where it belongs. </P>
<P>The plots to Sandler's movies aren't exactly the most intellectually 
stimulating are they? His prior box office blockbusters have kept the story 
"realistic" for the most part, but this is his first foray into something 
more supernatural and more of a fantasy. When you're making a movie about a 
regular human guy you're kind of limited as to who the supporting characters 
and story situations can be. When you're making a movie about the idiot son 
of the devil whose friends include a talking foul-mouthed bulldog, an 
ambiguously gay actor, two stoned-out headbangers, and a homely designer 
student - you can go a bit hog wild. </P>
<P>A lot of the film talks place in Hell and there's minor characters running 
all over the place, such as Rodney Dangerfield as the original Lucifer, a 
gatekeeper with breasts on his head and lots of demons and other monsters. 
Sandler's brand of comedy has been pretty lowbrow before, but since Satan 
himself is actually a major player in this story, the cruel, mean comedy is a 
bit more justified. Not that I condone the scenes of sodomizing Hitler with a 
pineapple, but the stuff that happens up above on Earth where Nicky must 
track down and battle his brothers is funny. </P>
<P>Take for example a scene in which Cassius has possessed the referee at a 
Harlem Globetrotters game. When he makes the players bash their heads on the 
table, and throws everyone out Nicky steps in and the two battle each other 
with their "magic powers." The audience just thinks it's part of the show 
even though the things they do are totally impossible. Another showdown 
occurs near the end where Nicky and Adrian actually get into a pillow fight ov
er who the next leader of Hell will be. In between there's a lot of other 
stupid jokes such as Henry Winkler getting stung by a million bees and Nicky 
convincing Adrian's minions that bunnies are cute and Popeye's chicken is 
really delicious (not-so-subtle product placement has always been one of 
Sandler's most unique talents). </P>
<P>"Little Nicky" doesn't have the best screenplay in the world, in fact it's 
probably one of the most contrived to come along in a few years. However, I 
must admit most of the jokes pay off. Sandler and his crew tend to repeat 
themselves with jokes about transvestites, bathroom functions, bodily fluids, 
and outrageous cartoony characters that end up getting hurt a lot. 
Technically, this stuff isn't much different from a b-movie but what makes it 
work is that it's consistent, and so over-the-top you know there's no way it 
can be taken seriously. It's almost as if you're laughing AT the movie 
instead of at the individual jokes. But as long as you enjoy yourself then 
what's the problem? </P>
