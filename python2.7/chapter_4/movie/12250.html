<PRE>                        DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS 1996
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                       2 :-( :-(  for being quaint</PRE>
<P>Cast: Steven Mackintosh, Rupert Graves, Miriam Margolyes, Saskia Reeves
Director: Richard Spence
Producer: John Chapman
Screenplay: Tony Marchant</P>
<P>There has been a movie made for almost every sexual encounter possible.
A man meets a woman they have sex (most movies), a man meets a man they
have sex (PRIEST), a woman meets a woman they have sex (BASIC INSTINCT),
a man meets a man dressed as woman they have sex (THE CRYING GAME) and
vice versa (TWELFTH NIGHT). So why is it DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS? Well, as
far as I know, this is one of the few films that deals with man meets
tran-sexual and they have sex.</P>
<P>The man we are referring to is Prentice (Rupert Everett), an
on-the-edge, adult-with-adolescent-complex, lacking-social-graces
misfit, who was once great friends with an effeminate guy named Karl
(Steven Mackintosh), in high school. The movie opens with Karl sensually
washing himself like a girl in the school shower, but when Karl becomes
Kim, instead of remaining sensual, he becomes a bit of an uptight,
prissy aristocrat. Steven Mackintosh does not seem to suit this role
well. He comes across as a bit of a Martina Navratilova - butch and
heavy-handed. If they wanted to make this movie a sensitive, romantic
piece they should have hired an actress to play the role of the
tran-sexual instead.</P>
<P>The whole film is a lead up to a moment where Kim gets to talk about her
skin softening with oestrogen replacement, her breasts getting larger
and fuller, the areolar darkening, inevitable giving Prentice a hard on.
The situation then leads to Prentice becoming confused about his sexual
orientation, followed by flashing his manhood around the neighbourhood,
before being arrested and assaulted by the police. Kim and Prentice then
put their personal and sexual differences aside and hop into bed. It is
here that Prentice gets to say ludicrously funny lines like, ‘Oh my God
it fits', like he was expecting it not too. Before a trite ending where
they sell the ‘Karl becomes Kim' story to a newspaper, buy an apartment
and ride off on a motor cycle like ‘Easy Riders'.</P>
<P>If you were ever confused about the issues of tran-sexualism, this movie
will not clarify it further.</P>
