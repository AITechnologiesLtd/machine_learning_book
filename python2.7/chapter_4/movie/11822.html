<PRE>THE DRIFTER WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD</PRE>
<PRE>By Edwin Jahiel</PRE>
<P>NAKED  (UK, 1993) *** 3/4  Directed and written by Mike Leigh. Photography,
Dick Pope. Production design, Allison Chitty. Editing, John Gregory. Music,
Andrew Dickson. Cast: David Thewlis, Lesley Sharp, Katrin Cartlidge, Peter
Wight, Greg Cruttwell, Claire Skinner, Ewen Bremner, Susan Vidler, Deborah
Maclaren, Gina McKee. 126 min. Rated R (language, violent sexual situations)</P>
<P>My  high rating comes with a warning.  "Naked" is terrific  but not to
everyone's taste. It is sleazy, unsettling, foul-mouthed and definitely not
uplifting. At  last year's Cannes Festival, it received two top prizes:
Best Director to Mike Leigh ("High Hopes," "Life Is Sweet,")  and Best
Actor to  David Thewlis, whose unforgettable performance outshines that of
any male  in the recent Oscar race. The  critics and cinephiles were also
very high on the film but some of the locals who saw it reacted with the
Gallic equivalent of "yuk."</P>
<P>Thewlis plays Johnny, a drifter who comes in from the cold -- or tries to
and fails, because he keeps undermining his own self. A grungy,  marginal
nihilist, he is also an intellectual and round-the-clock philosopher who
throws around words like "solipsism" within his scatological rhetoric.</P>
<P>He is first shown in  a dark  street of his native Manchester, raping a
woman (or more likely, having  brutal sex), then stealing a car and driving
to the London flat of ex-girlfriend Louise (Sharp) . She's out. He engages
in casual, violent and demeaning sex with spaced-out  house mate Sophie
(Cartlidge). All this goes comes with a  before, during and after stream of
talk :  insults, apothegms, incisive notions, the whole shebang.</P>
<P>Johnny is a fascinating 1990s anti-hero, brilliant but dysfunctional--
easily a borderline psycho. Though self-assured he also seeks ( in his
peculiar way)  truths and values.  He is cold, cynical and contemptuous
,yet understanding at times. He is a loner but one in need of human
contact.</P>
<P>He meets several characters, all distinctive for better or for worse, some
sleazy, all desperately lonely and  maladjusted, all powerfully drawn, all
of them naked -- naked meaning here not just bodies but minds and hearts.
There's something Russian about this "The Lower Depths" meeting "Dead
Souls", and there's something most British too: a blend of a certain
English life today and throwbacks to the 50s and 60s anger of British
cinema.</P>
<P>Johnny deals with those oddities with a mixture of sadism, contempt and
occasional flashes of sympathy.  He befriends briefly an inarticulate young
Scot and his girl, then  finds a kindred soul in a night watchman. Visiting
an older woman, her  pathetic offer of sex elicits a cruel refusal from
Johnny. A waitress provides a bath then turns him out. And there's more in
this semi-picaresque tale.</P>
<P>Some of these characters  do not reappear, others do, like Jeremy (who also
poses as Sebastian Hawkes), a wealthy, supercilious, vicious playboy who is
the flat's landlord, treats women like dirt and gets away with it, and
plans to kill himself at age 40.  Jeremy ( Cruttwell) is an uncanny Dirk
Bogarde look-  and sound-alike, with touches of Laurence Harvey.</P>
<P>Brian the watchman( Wight),  a calmly warm and likable older man with "the
most tedious boring job in England," symbolically guards an empty building
that Johnny calls "this post-modernist gas chamber."  Both men are the two
faces of the same coin and suffer from malaise.  Both are cultivated
readers, know the Bible inside out, have unfulfilled possibilities,
understand each other and engage in  talks full of metaphors, paradoxes,
Nostradamus prophecies, the Mark of the Beast, Revelations, the Apocalypse,
evolution ... It is a rambling session of sometimes delirious, sometimes
astute arguments on philosophy, sociology, metaphysics and theology.  It is
a like a medieval "disputatio, " the ancestor of debating societies.</P>
<P>You might want to meet Brian, but none of the others, including the often
sadistic Johnny. Yet whatever your reactions to him, he has undeniable
presence and his intoxication with words and ideas has life. Johnny makes
us question the intellectual complacency of most people.</P>
<P>"Naked" has no plot strictly speaking. Mike Leigh's method is to have his
actors repeatedly improvise and come up with dialogues and situations out
of which the final script emerges, a non high-concept scenario that defies
description, not to mention summing up.</P>
<P>Leigh himself said: " My feelings about "Naked" are as ambivalent as my
feelings about our chaotic late-20th century world, and probably as
ambivalent as the film itself, which is, I hope, as funny as it is sad, as
beautiful as it is anarchic. But I really don't want to pontificate about
the film. I'd rather let it speak for itself." It does that, loudly,
inchoately  and mesmerizingly.</P>
