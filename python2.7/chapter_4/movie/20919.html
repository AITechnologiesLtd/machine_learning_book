SINGIN' IN THE RAIN
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Contemporary Hollywood producers are often accused for the
damage they do to the reputation of American and world
cinema heritage by misusing old, classic movies as nothing
more than basis for cheap, empty and soulless remakes.
However, the misuse of the cinema heritage isn't the new
phenomenon; even some very talented authors and true artists
give a new, sometimes even twisted, perception of the old
films. The most notorious example is Stanley Kubrick in his
CLOCKWORK ORANGE - a single scene in this film was enough to
give totally different spin to one of the most beloved films
of all times - 1952 musical SINGIN' IN THE RAIN.</P>
<P>And that is really sad, because SINGIN' IN THE RAIN isn't
just one of the classics of Old Hollywood. It is also one
very fine example of a genre that is almost banished from
the big studios of today - musicals. Author of this review
used to adore that genre, especially the spectacular MGM
musicals made in 1940s and 1950s; in his earlier years, they
showed the magical, fairytale universes that used to created
the same sense of wonder like Lucas and his saga about a
galaxies far away. But things changed - in 1970s and 1980s
Hollywood found new ways to attract and entertain mass
audience, ways that required less talent and creativity than
those necessary for musicals. That was the reason why the
genre of musicals became obsolete and, unlike western,
didn't find a way to adapt to new realities. But that sad
fact was a blessing for the musicals of the Old Hollywood -
because they never had to compete with the newer musicals,
they kept their reputation as the best films of the genre.
And that also helped them to keep their reputation among
both the nostalgic audience and art-loving filmophiles.</P>
<P>SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, arguably the best of the genre and
often referred as one of the best films in the history, was
actually conceived as a way for MGM to re-use some of its
old material. Scriptwriters Betty Comden and Adolph Green
based the plot on the MGM-owned songs. Since many of them
were used in the first sound ("talking") pictures of late
1920s and early 1930s, the plot was set in Hollywood during
those years. The film starts in 1927 during the premiere of
"Royal Rascal", new period adventure by Monumental Pictures,
starring swashbuckling hero Don Lockwood (played by Gene
Kelly) and blonde bombshell Lana Lamont (played by Jane
Hagen). Studio had spread the rumours of Lockwood and Lamont
being romantically involved both on and off screen. Dan
actually can't stand Lana (which have some problems
distinguishing studio propaganda from reality), and instead
falls in love with a girl he meets on a street, aspiring
young actress Kathy Selden (played by Debbie Reynolds). His
problems with women are dwarfed by the problems of the
studio, suddenly faced with the "talking" movies phenomenon.
Silent era techniques are obsolete and the new film
"Duelling Cavalier" is bound for disaster, mostly because
the leading lady, Lana Lamont, has a voice that doesn't
match her physical beauty. Dan's old friend and trusted
partner, Cosmo Brown (played by Donald O'Connor) comes with
a brilliant idea - new movie is going to be turned into
musical, and Kathy is going to dub Lana's voice.</P>
<P>For some critics, the weakest element of many musicals is
the plot, often just a cheap excuse for connecting various
song and dance numbers. The script of SINGIN' IN THE RAIN
was made with such intentions, but the plot of this movie
actually works even without those scenes, turning this movie
into entertaining, very funny and at times even satirical
comedy. The film is even funnier for those who are more
familiar with the Hollywood history, with lot of references
to real life personalities, situations, rituals and, last
but not least, very accurate portrayal of the difficulties
experienced by Hollywood during the period when the movie
industry had to adapt to the use of sound. The movie
contains even some scenes that could be seen as a way for
Gene Kelly, its leading star, to spoof his own role in THREE
MUSKETEERS, 1948 swashbuckling classic.</P>
<P>However, the most recognisable element of SINGIN' IN THE
RAIN are the song and dance numbers. They were directed by
Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly, all of them in their artistic
prime and able to use huge MGM resources in order to create
spectacular, memorable scenes. Almost all of them are
superb, perfectly staged and some of them became essential
part of modern popular culture. Some of them are elaborate
and spectacular, like Gene Kelly's Broadway fantasy
featuring Cyd Charrise, although some would argue that it
looks somewhat out of place in this film. Another scene,
seduction of Kathy in an abandoned studio, is a triumph of
simplicity. Some are comical, like cartoon-like farce by
Donald O'Connor when he sings "Make Them Lough". But the
most important, most influential and most remembered of them
all is, of course, a scene featuring Gene Kelly singing and
dancing in the rain. When we take into account that Gene
Kelly was actually ill when he made those scenes, we must
really appreciate his talent and dedication.</P>
<P>The acting in the film was, of course, shadowed by the
dancing and singing, but that doesn't mean that people
involved didn't use their talents. Gene Kelly is extremely
charming and funny, same as Donald O'Connor as his comic
sidekick. Debbie Reynolds, who played a version of herself
in the film, being an aspiring young actress in real life as
well as in a movie, is simply adorable in her role and has a
very good chemistry with Kelly. Thankless job of a movie's
only villain, and rather unimpressive one, was superbly done
by Jean Hagen who earned the supporting role "Oscar"
nomination in the process. Hagen also dubbed Debbie Reynolds
in some scenes of the film, quite the opposite of the
characters in the movie. It is rather ironic, since the
script of SINGIN' IN THE RAIN satirically explored the
conflict between on-screen and off-screen life reality.</P>
<P>Made in the time when Hollywood was able to produce great
art and even satirically look at itself, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN
is one of those timeless classics that still have appeal to
the audience, even those younger generations that never
experienced the true power of musicals.</P>
