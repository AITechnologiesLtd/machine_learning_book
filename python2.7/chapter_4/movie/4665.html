<PRE>                            THUNDERBALL (1965)
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks

<PRE>THUNDERBALL (1965) **1/2</PRE>
<P>        This James Bond movie will forever be known as the 
underwater one, as it takes whatever interest or fascination anyone 
ever had with scuba diving and crashes it off a cliff, with overkill as 
the driver. This was Sean Connery's fourth appearance as 007, a sad 
follow-up to GOLDFINGER, but not quite as sad as the fifth Bond 
movie, YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE.</P>
<P>        The plot this time has SPECTRE stealing two atomic bombs 
from a crashed NATO plane. So that's overlong underwater sequence 
#1, when the evil scuba divers retrieve the bombs from the ocean floor. 
When SPECTRE demands a huge ransom from the U.S. and England, 
Bond is sent to investigate. He stumbles upon a Frenchman with an 
oceanside house, complete with shark pool and giant yacht. So here 
comes overlong underwater sequence #2, as Bond investigates the 
underside of the yacht and surrounding areas, shortly before a group of 
henchmen/frogmen attack him. There are only so many times you can 
watch someone get his scuba mask ripped off before it becomes 
tiresome.</P>
<P>        The main problem with THUNDERBALL is that such a 
significant chunk of it takes place underwater. Besides the two 
previously-mentioned overlong underwater sequences, #3 occurs when 
Bond finds and investigates the crashed plane, with #4 being the 
climactic underwater fight scene, where dozens of casualties occur on 
both sides. And as usual, Bond gets laid by three different women, 
though to my knowledge, this is the only time he's ever made love on 
the ocean floor (no jellyfish jokes, please). So he's now a member of 
the Mile Below Club. "I hope we didn't disturb the fish," he remarks to 
the lady afterwards. Okay, _now_ you can make your jellyfish jokes.</P>
