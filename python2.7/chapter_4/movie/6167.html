                     The Shining (1980)
                   A film review by Fury
                    Copyright 1996 Fury</PRE>
<P>STANLEY KUBRICK'S "THE SHINING"
Starring Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall</P>
<PRE>Rating Scale: 0 to ****</PRE>
<PRE>        RATING: ***1/2</PRE>
<P>        "The Shining" is about the happenings at the Overlook Hotel
having to do with our main character, Jack Nicholson, and his wife,
played by Shelley Duvall, as the caretakers of the hotel over the
winter.  It is also a good chance for Jack Torrance (Nicholson's
character) to get started on his new writing career, but there is
undoubtedly something wrong with the granted isolation.  Their son,
Danny (I don't quite remember the young actor's name), possesses some
sort of clairvoyance, known in the film as "the shining".  
        Halloran (Scatman Crothers), who also has 'the shining', is
the head chef of the hotel who establishes a slight communication
between himself and Danny earlier in the film.  Therefore, if
something should go wrong in their place for the winter, Danny would
be able to telepathically message him. 
        And boy, does it go wrong.  A month passes, and we already
start to see the craziness in Nicholson's character.  Mainly, this is
found in the parts in which Jack is typing, trying to work on his new
career.  Wendy (Duvall) disturbs him, and at this point, the insanity
progressively increases.
        The hotel's past is overshadowed with evil that lingers.
Danny is able to see some of the things his family can't.  His eyes
can see memories of the dark past as if they were real, as well as
future events.  He can see the evil spirits that reside in the halls
and the rooms of the Overlook Hotel.  These scenes are nothing short
of extraordinary, portraying Kubrick's brilliance in a vivid way.
        Many of you may disagree with my rating.  But I have many
reasons to back up the ***1/2.  The atmosphere is simply dazzling,
both eerie and terror-packed at the same time.  The characters could
use some work, but that is understandable, because Kubrick obviously
didn't want to waste time in giving his message.  They are just
representations of evil, good, and fear.  But the mood more than makes
up for the problems in the film, either way.  Nicholson does an
excellent job in taking the role of an insane man, as it is both
entertaining and scary.  
        The other big reason why I gave this film my rating is that it
was intelligently meaningful.  On the surface, "The Shining" is just a
good horror film.  But on am much deeper level, it is *filled* with
discreet messages that represent Kubrick's object of the film: the
origins of evil.  You may have to watch it more than once to get all
of it, but rest assured, it is well worth it.
        "The Shining" is a film about evil and its different forms.
Some people have said it was overlong, but I couldn't care less,
because I found myself entertained and bombarded with many important
Kubrick-style messages straight through to the end.
        Ignore the negative gripes that critics have said about this
masterful work.  Instead of all that flack they gave you, I found it
to be intelligently symbolic, absolutely *amazing* in the atmosphere
department, and a good horror film on the surface either way.
        People, this is a *must-see*.  It is a masterpiece.  See "The
Shining" at any expense.   </P>
