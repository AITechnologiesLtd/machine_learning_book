<P>Hollywood conservatives beware! The two best films of the new millennium 
aren't great dramatic narratives, heart-tugging romances or even 
intellectual studies. First The Big Tease, a lowbrow mockumentary 
cracking jokes at Scottish and homosexuals. Now The Whole Nine Yards, an 
uproarious date flick full of over-exaggerations.</P>
<P>"Oz" Oseransky (Matthew Perry) is a dentist, which, according to several 
sources throughout the film, makes him a likely suicide candidate. This 
isn't helped by the fact that his ex-partner, who also was his 
father-in-law, embezzled massive amounts of money before dying. Now Oz 
lives in misery with his wife Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), his 
mother-in-law (Carmen Ferlan) and a mammoth debt.</P>
<P>Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudesky (Bruce Willis) is a 17-times-veteran contract 
killer fresh out of the slammer thanks to a loose tongued plea-bargain. 
But Jimmy refused witness protection so he has turned to a new life in 
Canada for safety and good gardening soil (tomatoes grow quickly)- next 
door to Oz.</P>
<P>Janni Gogolak (Kevin Pollak) is the son of the crime-boss that Tudesky 
ratted out. He lives in Chicago with several hit-men, Tudesky's 
estranged wife (Natasha Henstridge) and a contract on Tudesky's head.</P>
<P>Everyone from oz's secretary to Gogolak seems to want or need someone 
dead for either revenge, money or necessity. Who are the double agents? 
Who will live? Who will die? And which one turns out to be the cop?</P>
<P>The Whole Nine Yards proves to be a hysterical blend of Airplane and 
Goodfellas. Of all the dark comedies over the past several years, none 
have managed to make murder as funny as it is here. Responsible for this 
phenomenon is undoubtedly the cast. Perry's innocent facial 
expressions, Willis' ability to deliver absurd lines with the utmost 
seriousness and Pollak's beautifully overacted gangster are certainly 
contributing factors. But the real treats are Michael Clarke Duncan 
(recently in The Green Mile) and Amanda Peet (recently in Isn't She 
Great) as a hit-man and secretary, respectively. Duncan, for those of 
you not familiar with him, is a huge African-American man who 
demonstrates his comedic ability with this intentionally cliched 
tough-guy character. Peet is an exceptionally attractive female with a 
knack for delivering nutty punch lines in a fashion even more impressive 
than Willis.</P>
<P>Another key factor in the film's success is its ability to handle 
murder in such a hysterically nonchalant manner. For every bit as 
ultra-disturbing and spine tingling as The Talented Mr. Ripley was, The 
Whole Nine Yards is boisterously entertaining. This goes to show that a 
grade-A comedy ensemble can make extraordinary light of what was equally 
serious when presented in another manner. There are actually more deaths 
in this film than Ripley and The Whole Nine Yards plays at a fraction of 
Ripley's time.</P>
<P>Critics will likely quip that the movie loses points at the end due to 
over-sappiness and a forced romance. I beg to differ. The Whole Nine 
Yards truly achieves its full pomp when it manages to integrate these 
"awe!" scenes with its uproarious comedy. The end result is something 
that Hollywood hasn't seen a quality version of in a long time: a 
Friday night date flick.</P>
