<P>A THOUSAND ACRES(Touchstone/Buena Vista)Directed by Jocelyn Moorhouse
 The film adaptation of Jane Smiley's Pulitzer Prize-winning "A Thousand
Acres" works so hard to pack as much of the book into an hour and 45
minutes that it feels like the highlights tape pulled from several
months of a daytime soap-opera. Incest, lawsuits, broken marriages,
impulsive affairs, senility, cancer, suicide: They're all present and
accounted for. You'll barely have time to weep over one crisis before an
even worse one pops up.
 But at the heart of this sometimes strident movie are two magnificent
performances, which redeem everything that surrounds them. As the
relentlessly downbeat and vengeance-hungry Rose, Michelle Pfeiffer all
but breathes fire. Mad about everything---and mad at herself
besides---Rose rips away years of cover-ups to reveal her family's
darkest secrets, as well as her private hell. When Pfeiffer challenges
her husband (Kevin Anderson) after a ruined game of Monopoly, it's a
scene Bette Davis would have come back from the grave to play.
 Equally "wow"-worthy is Jessica Lange as the serene, industrious Ginny,
whose perpetual happy face finally cracks and disintegrates. Few
actresses give themselves over to a role as thoroughly as Lange does:
She leaps into the pit at the bottom of Ginny's soul, unafraid of where
she'll land. Playing off the equally determined Pfeiffer seems to
sharpen her instincts even more; plenty of sparks fly before the finale.
 Laura Jones's screenplay sometimes short-sells the novel's themes and
its' characters' motivations, but the priviledge of watching two of
America's finest leading ladies scaling new dramatic heights is reason
enough to put "Acres" on your must-see list.
