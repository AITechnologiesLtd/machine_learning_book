<PRE>`Double Jeopardy' – The Fugitive that Never Should've
Been
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>I think that at some point, Tommy Lee Jones, who I
think is a very talented actor, must be able to find
some work that doesn't involve him reprising his role
from `The Fugitive'.  In that memorable film, (to
which this one will undoubtedly remind you of) he
plays a smart lawman with the tracking ability of a
bloodhound.  In a recent film, `US Marshalls,' he did
the same thing.   And in this film, well, you kind of
get the point. </P>
<P>Libby Parsons (Ashley Judd who oozes with potential
but always winds up in mediocre movies) wakes up one
night on her yacht to find that her husband, Nick
(Bruce Greenwood) is missing.  There's blood
everywhere, and when Libby manages the courage to
begin searching around, the only thing that she finds
is a bloody knife.  Just as she picks it up, a coast
guard cutter arrives thinking that she has sliced and
diced her husband to death.  Despite the fact that the
body is never found, the prosecution convinces the
jury (through nothing but circumstantial evidence) to
convict her of the crime.  During her incarceration,
she discovers that Nick is alive.  He has somehow
framed Libby for his murder, though the reasons are a
bit unclear to me.  Now she only wants to get out of
jail to track him down.  Six years pass by and she
learns one very important thing – the principle of
double jeopardy.  It states that once the State
convicts you of a crime, it can not retry you for the
same crime.  So, in essence, she's free to walk up to
Nick and shoot him the head.</P>
<P>Armed with this knowledge, but with very little else,
she manages to get paroled.  Her parole officer is the
gruff and man-of-little patience Travis Lehman
(Jones).  Though he will throw any one who breaks
curfew back into jail without hesitation, Libby
escapes the first chance she gets.  Lehman now goes
after her (allowing those that he oversaw to break
curfew all they want), and the chase is on.  Can Libby
clear her name before Lehman tracks her down?  I
wouldn't think so.  She's just not well equipped to do
so.  She's not a killer, so it's hard to believe that
she would actually cold-heartedly pull the trigger
when she finally does find Nick (which the movie
trailers tell us that she does).  And though she makes
phone calls, surfs the internet and makes inquiries
here and there, she doesn't really seem to have a plan
of attack.  As a result, the film just proceeds along
like some Kansas interstate highway.  There are no
turns or twists or anything that would play on the
irony of her situation.  There are some scenes that
heighten Libby's fragile predicament such as when she
plunges over the side of a ferry or when she is
entombed next to a decaying corpse.  But this just
tries to pump some juice into a film that just doesn't
have enough electricity to keep going.</P>
<P>`Double Jeopardy' just lacked any significant amount
of style and intrigue.  The film doesn't exhibit the
kind of energy that these kinds of chase movies need
nor did it create any kind of chemistry between the
hunter and the hunted.  If you ever look through the
newspaper ads for movies currently playing, you'll
always notice quotes from various sources when there
is something good to say.  The funny thing is that
when you look at the ad for `Double Jeopardy,' you'll
see a quote from, of all places, NYLON magazine. 
Anybody ever heard of them?  When you start pulling
quotes from those kinds of places, it should be a sign
that this is one to avoid.</P>
