<PRE>                                  SPECIES
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     On the surface, SPECIES is something like a new version of ALIEN
taking place on Earth.  Once you look *really* closely, though, you
realize it's a movie about one woman getting naked.</P>
<P>     The woman is newcomer Natasha Henstridge, who spends most of the
film in her birthday suit--or her alternative alien suit when the need
arises.  In case you haven't seen the previews, my friend pretty much
summed up his impression of Henstridge by asking me during the film,
"Did you write down 'babe-a-licious?'"  My response:  "One 's' or two?"</P>
<P>     SPECIES starts out with an interesting idea:  that an alien
civilization would radio us a plan to genetically engineer a new (and
far superior) race, which would inevitably destroy us all.  Henstridge
is "Sil," the code name of the first of these creatures, which escapes
from captivity much too easily and begins marauding Los Angeles in an
attempt to mate.  Sil is a femme fatale in the purest sense of the
word.  Believe me, when she says "no," she *means* it, as one guy who
tries to take advantage of her quickly finds out.</P>
<P>     The first half of the film is pretty good.  Here, Sil is unsure of
her identity, and she struggles with her half-human, half-lizard,
half-cockroach existence, metamorphosing from one form to another when
duty calls.  Sil is on the run, but she doesn't know why; as a youth,
her instinct hasn't yet kicked in, and because she's had no
"upbringing," she survives on the street with only raw emotion.  When
the inevitable band of four scientists and hunter Michael Madsen come
after her, Sil panics and must kill kill kill.</P>
<P>     Needless to say, a somewhat thoughtful film was not what I was
expecting out of SPECIES, and sure enough, by the time the second hour
rolls around, the film degenerates into a formulaic search and destroy
movie.  It's never scary.  Even the [insert favorite non-threatening
creature] suddenly jumping at one of the good guys doesn't cause much
of a stir in the crowd.</P>
<P>     The Giger-designed creature is okay, but it's just like the one in
ALIEN.  The main effects problem is the ending, where crummy digital
animation is used in place of models and makeup, effectively negating
any suspense, and making the finale look kind of funny.  Even Marg
Helgenberger, as Madsen's love interest, starts off as pretty cool, but
she ends up as goofy as her compatriots (including
much-better-than-this-film actors Ben Kingsley and Forest Whitaker) by
getting stuck between some rocks.</P>
<P>     Of course, Henstridge steals the show and makes the film nearly
watchable.  She looks almost inhuman as it is ... and some of her
transformation sequences are almost too real.  In fact, I once dated a
girl who ... well, but that's another story.</P>
