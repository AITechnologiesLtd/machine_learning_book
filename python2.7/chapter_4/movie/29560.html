<PRE>RAPA NUI (1994)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>At times Hollywood leaves impression of being run by
lunatics, drunks and other people who lost their most basic
mental abilities. This was especially the case in 1990s,
when big studios pumped obscenely large amounts of money
into projects that were doomed to flop from the start. Kevin
Costner's WATERWORLD is usually the best known example of
Hollywood's egos run amok, but the production team of Kevin
Reynolds and Kevin Costner can't be accused of starting that
unfortunate adventure without any sense of caution. One year
before they made WATERWORLD, they tested the uncharted
waters of ecological action spectacle by making somewhat
less ambitious and less expensive project called RAPA NUI.</P>
<P>The plot of this film is based on the legends and historical
speculations about Easter Island in Southeast Pacific, the
most remote part of the world that was ever settled by human
beings. Dutch explorers, upon discovering those islands in
1722, found impressive statues but the the local population,
made of stone-age cannibalistic savages, seemed incapable of
erecting them. The movie tries to give the explanation for
this by setting the story few decades before the arrival of
Europeans. The island is so far away from the other lands
and that the descendants of Polynesian settlers forgot their
roots and believe that they are the only people in the
world. Lack of external conflicts doesn't mean that there
aren't tensions within the community - the society is
divided into two classes based on racial features -
aristocratic "Long Ears" and plebeian "Short Ears". The
class and racial tensions has begun to escalate because of
the population explosion; the island is simply too small to
provide the needs for the people. Old and senile king
Ariki-mau (played by Eru Potaka-Dewes) is less concerned
with those problems, because he thinks only of erecting
bigger and bigger statues in order to placate gods. His
grandson Naro (played by Jason Scott Lee) has other things
on his mind, since he fell in love in "Short Ear" girl
Ramana (played by Sandirine Holt). Love that crosses class
divide happens in worst of all times, since "Short Ears"
like Make (played by Esai Morales) are less and less
enthusiastic about "Long Ears" rule, which slowly but
inevitably paves the way for brutal civil unrest.</P>
<P>RAPA NUI definitely belongs to the same category as
multitude of other films with strong environmental message,
which used to be made during the zenith of Hollywood's
"political correctness" in early to mid 1990s. What
distinguishes this film from those films is the manor in
which the message is delivered to the audience. Namely,
filmmakers wisely chose to set the plot in a time before
arrival of Europeans, thus sparing the viewers from
"politically correct" cliches of evil European civilisation
destroying the nature. RAPA NUI shows that less advanced
native cultures, which are supposed to be more "in tune"
with the nature, can be equally or even more deadly to the
environment than their modern-day equivalents. What is even
more remarkable about this film is the fact that the whole
story can be seen as powerful allegory about the current
state of human civilisation as a whole,. The little spot of
land in the middle of endless sea is more-or-less in the
same situation as our lonely little rock in dark cold
universe, and in the ecologically induced class struggle
between "Long Ears" and "Short Ears" we might see reflection
of the escalating conflict between rich and privileged
states of the First World and numerically increasing yet
constantly impoverished multitudes of the Third World.
Unlike other films that try to shove the Message down our
throats by, RAPA NUI successfully shows how greed, ignorance
and unbalanced approach towards environment can bring down
entire civilisation.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, most of the viewers have to digest this
message in the context of plot, characters and situations
that sometimes look too cliched or simplistic, or simply out
of place. One of the examples is the triathlon scene, which
looks like it was added into the film only to provide some
testosterone- filled action in otherwise depressive movie.
The writer and director Kevin Reynolds nevertheless manages
to keep things under control, helped by ethnically diverse
and very capable cast. Despite many flaws, RAPA NUI is a
film that can leave a strong impression on any viewers, and
after WTC bombings, when the future of our world seems so
uncertain, this impression is definitely going to be even
stronger.</P>
