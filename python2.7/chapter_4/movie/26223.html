<PRE>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A>
"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Thanks to a growing catalog of disturbing short films, François Ozon has
been dubbed `the bad boy of French cinema' and his latest, Criminal
Lovers, will do nothing but bolster his claim to that crown.  The film
is a sick, twisted and, at times, terrifying blend of Natural Born
Killers and Badlands, with a little Deliverance and Hansel & Gretel
thrown in for good measure.</P>
<P>Lovers opens with a sexually aggressive student named Alice (Natacha
Régnier, The Dreamlife of Angels) playing a nasty prank on her impotent
boyfriend Luc (Jérémie Rénier).  But this trick isn't the only one
playful Alice has up her sleeve.  She also convinces Luc to help her
slaughter an Arab classmate named Saïd.  The scene is graphic and the
two killers seem strangely indifferent as they try to clean up the
bloody murder scene.  The teens hit the road, with Saïd's body in their
trunk, stopping only to rob a jeweler and exercise the five-finger
discount at a supermarket.</P>
<P>The murder occurs about ten minutes into the film, before we really
learn anything about either Alice or Luc.  You may begin to scratch your
head and wonder who these kids are and what exactly led to this crime
spree.  Don't worry - Lovers is told via flashbacks in this uniquely
structured film.  What you might want to worry about is the frightening
incident the teens experience upon stumbling on an isolated shack in the
woods when they bury their classmate's body.</P>
<P>Ozon's cold direction (he also wrote the script) might leave some people
shaking their heads and accusing him of attempting only to shock, but
you can't deny that Ozon is a brilliant, stylish filmmaker.  Lovers is
only his second feature film, and the world should both anticipate and
dread his next project.</P>
<P>1:30 – Not Rated but contains adult language, nudity, strong sexual
content,
rape, graphic violence, canibalism and a scene featuring a rabbit
skinning</P>
