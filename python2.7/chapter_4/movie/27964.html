<PRE><b>THE LEGEND OF DRUNKEN MASTER</b></PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * * *</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Chia-Liang Liu
Written by: King-Sang Tseng, Kai-Chi Yun</PRE>
<P>You know, I'm still trying to figure out what exactly the plot to <i>Drunken 
Master 2</i> was, but I'm going to attempt a plot summary anyway. Wong 
Fei-Hong (Jackie Chan) is a master of drunken boxing. This apparently means 
that while he's a great martial artist to begin with, when he has a little 
alcohol he becomes just about invincible. Wong was on a trip with his 
father, Wong Kei-ying (Ti Lung), when a parcel he was carrying is stolen by 
an old soldier (Lau Kar Leung). Wong believes he has recovered the parcel 
after a long (and simply amazing) fight, but he has grabbed the wrong 
package on accident. Wong and his father go back to their home, where his 
father teaches martial arts and is a respected physician. Soon the old 
soldier comes calling and Wong finds himself embroiled in a plot involving a 
business man's (Ken Lo Houi-Kang) theft of Chinese art. Wong must try to 
stop the plot, but he has a few other things to worry about as well. He has 
to reconcile with his father after the two have a fierce falling out, and he 
must try to keep his pregnant step-mother (Anita Mui) from fighting.</P>
<P>For those of you who don't know, <i>The Legend of Drunken Master</i> is 
actually a re-release of <i>Drunken Master 2</i> from 1994. Why would 
Dimension choose to take such an old Chan flick and release it again with a 
new title and a massive publicity campaign? It's simply because <i>Drunken 
Master 2</i> is Chan's best flick. Forget everything you've seen in Jackie 
Chan movies before, and prepare yourself for fight scenes like you've never 
experienced. The really amazing part about the movie isn't that the fight 
scenes are so spectacular, it's that during the lulls between fights it is 
so funny you shouldn't be bored. In particular, Anita Mui (who plays Chan's 
step-mother but is actually younger than him) is an absolute hoot as a woman 
who just might be the epitome of "strong willed". Her scene where she is 
trying to distract Wong's father's wrath is simply too funny for words. Yet 
the film's best comic moments come from Chan himself when he gets a few 
drinks under his belt and starts babbling about things like monkeys stealing 
the wine. For those of you who saw <i>Shanghai Noon</i>, remember the scene 
in the bordello? When Chan gets drunk and thinks his horse is dead? Well 
imagine a movie packed with scenes like that.</P>
<P>Alright, let's face facts here. The acting in a Jackie Chan movie is about 
as important as the acting in your average <i>Friday the 13th</i> sequel. 
The fact that the film contains some of the most horrendous dubbing in 
history makes the acting even more unimportant, but I'm going to give a 
critique a shot anyway. Chan is hilarious, showing some of his great comic 
timing in two scenes. One is where he fights five men at once while trying 
to get drunk, the other is the aftermath of this fight where he must deal 
with his furious father. Veteran martial-arts actor Lung Ti does an 
admirable job as the father. It's strange, but while Lung fights very little 
in the film we always get the impression that he could beat just about 
anyone black and blue with his eyes close. Anita Mui is an absolute riot as 
Chan's mother, though I wish she'd had just one chance to fight. Finally we 
have Ken Lo Houri-Kang, who may not be much of an actor (I don't speak 
Chinese, but I could tell his line delivery was more than a little off), but 
this man has moves like you've never seen before.</P>
<P>Speaking of moves, whoah boy, you want to talk about some astounding action 
scenes? <i>Drunken Master 2</i> is overflowing with them. The opening fight 
scene, in which Chan and Lau Kar Leung battle it out under a train is 
excellent, filled with moves so fast I couldn't follow the action half the 
time (that's not an insult, it was amazing). Then, just as I was getting 
over this fight and a few similar duels that followed, we're hit by Chan and 
Lau Kar Leung fighting an army of axe-wielding warriors. This one scene must 
have required more choreography than nearly every other scene in the film 
combined. So, as I was reeling from that battle, this vastly entertaining 
movie hits us with yet ANOTHER battle scene at the end, between Chan and his 
real life bodyguard, the amazing Ken Lo Houi-Kang. Houi-Kang has the most 
amazing balance I've ever seen, being able to attack repeatedly with one 
foot kicking from every different angle. In one truly amazing shot he stands 
on one leg, holds the other leg up in the air till they form one straight 
line, and doesn't falter at all. Yeesh, I'm lucky if I can kick straight out 
without falling over.</P>
<P>I do have one small complaint with <i>Drunken Master 2</i>, and it's the way 
characters are wasted. I'm referring specifically to a young lady seen near 
the film's mid-point, who seems to have a romantic interest in Jackie. We 
don't see her again till close to the film's conclusion, and at that point 
she seems to have no interest at all in Jackie. A friend of Chan's who knows 
a different form of martial arts (the two have a heated argument over which 
is better) is also sadly underused. All that aside, let's it. Anyone who 
complains that this movie doesn't have enough plot or character development 
doesn't know what they're talking about. I'm not trying to be rude, but it's 
the truth. People going to see this movie want great action. They shouldn't 
care about plot and character development, and if they do they've obviously 
never heard of Jackie Chan before (in which case they've been living in a 
cave for the past ten years). <i>Drunken Master 2</i> runs what could have 
been a long 102 minutes, but it didn't feel half that long to me. I'd 
recommend the to any Jackie Chan fans out there and give it four out of five 
stars.</P>
