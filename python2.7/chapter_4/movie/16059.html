<PRE>As reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>Good serious movies, by their nature, have to have some element of comedy in
them. Whether it be satire, irony, or downright slapstick humor, they
distract us from the serious nature of the story until we don't know what
has happened and end up missing the movie and characters when they end. Of
course, you ask, how could a movie with a title like Even Cowgirls Get the
Blues be funny at all, let alone serious at the same time? The answer: a
beautiful adaptation by Gus Van Sant (who also directs) and a fine
performance by Uma Thurman.</P>
<P>In the movie, based on the novel by Tom Robbins, Uma Thurman plays Sissy
Hankshaw, the world's best hitchhiker because she has the world's largest
thumbs (expressed perfectly in the line, "The Lord God made me to direct
traffic."). She has no job most of the time but, when she works, is the
model for the Dew Mist feminine hygiene spray. On one modeling assignment
her travels takes her to a beauty ranch whose cowgirls are lesbians (without
a political agenda! A non-stereotyped Hollywood, at last!). Upon coming to
the ranch she finds love with the ringleader Bonanza Jellybean (Rain
Phoenix).</P>
<P>Trapped in the same world all of us are, trying to find love, fit in, and
get along, she believes that her happiness has been found with these
cowgirls, but sadness is just as likely to hit there as anywhere else, and,
as the title goes, Even Cowgirls get the Blues.</P>
<P>As just about everything Gus Van Sant does is, the film is excellent as a
metaphor movie. In addition, it keeps an interesting intelligence to the
cowgirls, all of whom are endowed with a wisdom that surpasses most
people's. Like Drugstore Cowboy (1989), Gus Van Sant's other fairly surreal
foray, it's inaccessible to the average viewer because of its trippy nature
and political riskiness (Drugstore Cowboy was a film about a crew of dope
fiends, Even Cowgirls Get the Blues is a film about lesbians that can offend
it's target group.) If you can actually get past the oddities, though, it's
one of the funniest films you'll ever see, but one that will leave you
wishing that cowgirls didn't have to get the blues.</P>
