<P>OFFICE SPACE
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)
20th Century Fox / 1:29 / 1999 / R (brief nudity, language, a comic sex 
scene)
Cast: Ron Livingston; Gary Cole; Jennifer Aniston; Stephen Root; David 
Herman; John C. McGinley; Ajay Naidu; Diedrich Bader; Paul Willson 
Director: Mike Judge 
Screenplay: Mike Judge<HR>"Beavis and Butt-Head" and "King of the Hill" creator Mike Judge goes 
live-action in "Office Space," and the end result is more animated than 
either of his respectively overhyped and overrated TV projects. It could 
be that Judge's shrewd sense of social satire feels more at home played 
out by actual people instead of crudely-rendered doodles, or perhaps 
it's just that "Office"'s hook is a can't-miss ribbing of the daily 
occupational grind - something that almost everybody everywhere can 
relate to. Whatever the ultimate reason, this lively gutbuster appears 
to indicate a promising format change for the occasionally lauded (and 
occasionally controversial) auteur. It's ironic to note, then, that the 
film is based on the cartoon "Milton" shorts he created for "Saturday 
Night Live."</P>
<P>The hero of "Office Space" is Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston), a 
stressed-out software engineer at a fairly ambiguous corporation called 
Initech. Aggravated by performing insipid tasks, omnipresent 
middle-management and the looming threat of downsizing, he seeks help 
from a hypnotherapist. But when the doctor keels over mid-session, 
leaving his patient in a calm, Zen-like trance, Peter suddenly finds 
himself trapped in an agreeable state of perpetual relaxation. 
Irritation and hatred are replaced by ease and indifference. When the 
boss ("The Brady Bunch Movie"'s Gary Cole) steps in his way to chat 
about his recent apathetic streak, Peter just zips around him and keeps 
on walking. You go, boy. </P>
<P>Needless to say, much of this white-collar comedy is going to elicit 
smiles, chortles and even cheers from viewers who can say, "Been there, 
wish I'd done that." "Office Space" paints such an amusingly dead-on 
portrait of office life that many of the jokes and sight-gags - ranging 
from en-route rush hour to hungry fax machines to cramping cubicles - 
are irresistible in a unanticipatedly honest way. (Incidents of mass 
exaggeration number surprisingly few.) OK, so maybe poking laughs at the 
workplace isn't the most original idea, what with the comic strip 
Dilbert and the sitcoms "Working" and "The Drew Carey Show," but the 
numerous bullseyes here are innovative even if the target is not. </P>
<P>Though Judge's clever writing and appropriately understated direction 
are key factors in making "Office Space" the success that it is, a 
terrific cast also contributes undeniable strength to the final product. 
Livingston, whose sole noteworthy credit was back in 1996's "Swingers," 
makes a perfectly unfazed leading man, his delightfully deadpan facade 
ranking as the movie's main attraction. Cole has a lot of fun as Peter's 
evil overseer, peppering his lines with hilariously absent-minded 
"yeeeeahs" and "mm-hms," while "Friends"' Jennifer Aniston is adorable 
as the object of Peter's affection, an oft-scolded waitress at a T.G.I. 
Friday's-like eatery. Their romance is largely superfluous, but "Office 
Space" does use the Aniston role to observe the parallel travails of 
those in the service industry. </P>
<P>Also giving their all are David Herman, Ajay Naidu and Stephen Root as 
assorted colorful "Office" lackeys, and this last actor gets to steal 
scenes as the real-life version of Judge's Milton character, the 
frequently put-down black sheep of Initech. These subordinates, along 
with Livingston, attempt to strike back at their superiors in wildly 
different ways (steering towards a pitch-perfect, if slightly 
disappointing, ending), but it's Peter Gibbons who gets the ball 
rolling. Watching "Office Space" may cause a stirring in the hearts of 
many viewers experiencing job-related ruts similar to Peter's. If they 
follow suit, expect the unemployment rate to skyrocket, but darn - if it 
won't be empowering!<HR>© 1999 Jamie Peck
