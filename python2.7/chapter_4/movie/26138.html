<P>The original URBAN LEGEND was not a good movie. It got hacked at the knees
by the critics and clomped over the head at the box-office, with a little
over $38 million in final grosses. So now that the whole "teen slasher"
genre seems to be dissipating, what do you think is the best thing to do for
a studio? Well, it's pretty obvious, no? Release a sequel to a film that
wasn't so good in the first place and hope that its hackneyed plotline could
resurrect the genre!! Yeesh, what are these people thinking...</P>
<P>PLOT:
A bunch of college film students are completing their own movie projects
with the hopes of winning the prestigious Hitchcock award, a prize which
apparently leads directly to the riches of Hollywood. Suddenly, many of them
start dropping like flies, as a mysterious killer begins his swatting. Will
they live to finish their films? Will they ever figure out who the killer
really is? Will Joey Lawrence ever make us forget all about "Blossom"? Find
out below...</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A fun opening scene leads to a great opening murder which eventually leads
to one of the stupidest movies of the year. That's right, people.
Stupid...just plain dumb! There were so many cool ways in which this film
could have gone, but for some reason or another, the filmmakers decided to
start off strong and then jump right into yet another pile of heaping teen
slasher absurdity. It's funny because if there was one thing that everyone
agreed on about the first film, it was the fact that the mystery of the
murderer was so ridiculous, so "out there", that it reinforced much of the
idiocy that came before it. Well, apparently nobody from this production
decided to take any lessons away from the first go-around, and seriously
mucked this one up even larger. I get the feeling that these screenwriters
sit around thinking, "Who do you think is the one person which people would
LEAST suspect? Okay, let's go with that then!" Uhhhm, okay that's fine
fellas, but you know that it also has to make a little bit of sense, don't
you? Just a little bit...c'mon...please!!</P>
<P>The sad part is that the first half hour of this movie is actually pretty
good. It has some tense moments, funny moments, an exciting murder sequence
that should gross anybody out, and a decent little premise set in a perfect
place to develop a great story (film sets). Unfortunately for the audience,
that's where the "good" part of the movie ends. About half an hour into the
film, a character just happens to "pop into" the picture and pretty much
designates the exact spot at which the film ricochets into a downward spiral
of implausibility, predictability and just plain stupidity.</P>
<P>It was as if another director suddenly took over from the guy who started.
This second director might've been a fan of soap operas in his day, but
that's another story. And that's when the "idiot moves" begin. Girl being
chased, runs into a forest. Good move. Girl being chased again, runs up a
million steps to get to the roof. Uhhhm, and that's gonna help you...how?
And since when is there nobody, and I mean NOBODY else on a huge campus such
as theirs!? I dare any of you to show me one other student who shows up
anywhere in this film! It's just so sad, so ridiculous and just so stupid.
But don't fault the actors. They all actually do decent jobs with what they
have to work with, especially Jennifer Morrison who gives a solid
performance, and even Joey, oops, Joseph Lawrence who comes out of this one,
unscathed. The problem is the script, the script and the script! Half an
hour in, the plot is shot up like Swiss cheese and even though I was hoping
for some kind of "twist ending" to save it all, all I got was a "twist
ending" so completely out of left field, that it just had me laughing out
loud. In fact, pretty much everyone in the audience was laughing at the last
30 minutes of this film. Not sure if that was the idea, but that's what
happened here and deservedly so. Oh yeah, and the soundtrack was also
non-existent (the teens will love that, Mr. Filmmaker, good move!). I can't
say much more, but there it is. Check out the first half hour, then walk out
and get your money back. Trust me, you'll have seen all that you need to
see.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Joey (Joseph) Lawrence's birth name is Joseph Mignogna Jr.
This is Jennifer Morrison's first lead role in a picture, but she did have a
crucial role in last year's under-appreciated thriller STIR OF ECHOES, in
which she played "Samantha Kozac", the missing girl.
This is director John Ottman's directorial debut, although he has been in
the business for a number of years as a composer and editor. He composed the
music and edited three Bryan Singer movies, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, APT PUPIL
and PUBLIC ACCESS, and was the composer on several other "horror" flicks
including LAKE PLACID, H20 and 1997's SNOW WHITE aka SNOW WHITE: A TALE OF
TERROR. He also edited and composed the music for this film.
There are two specific "inside" references to the original URBAN LEGEND
movie in this film. The first is a scene in which two students are wearing
the exact same parkas as the killer from the first movie. And the second is
a scene which I will not ruin, but it's the last scene of the movie and it
refers directly to the first one as well. That final one is actually pretty
funny, with the Hitchcock music playing in the background, but much like the
rest of the movie, it ultimately goes nowhere.
Hart Bochner, the man who plays professor Solomon in this movie, is also a
director himself. He directed the Zucker brothers' HIGH SCHOOL HIGH, and PCU
back in 1994. He's probably best remembered for his role in the original DIE
HARD movie. He's the bearded horny dude who gets killed early on and loves
his cocaine.</P>
