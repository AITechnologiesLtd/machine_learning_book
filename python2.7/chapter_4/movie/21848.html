<P>"The Legend of 1900" begins in a music shop in mid-century, viols and and 
horns hanging down amid the glorious clutter.  Suddenly we are in the boiler 
room of a gargantuan steamship, men working their hardest to fill the maws 
of the furnaces with coal.</P>
<P>What helps Giuseppe Tornatore's "The Legend of 1900" work its magic are 
these striking locations, places we want to be.  It all works together to 
form a wonderful story, we are made to understand - a story no less immense 
than life itself.</P>
<P>What Tornatore did for the cinema in "Cinema Paradiso," he attempts in 
"1900" to do for music.  To make his job more awesome he casts it in the 
mold of a bold time, naming his very protagonist for the new century.  This 
boy, you see, is the son of immigrants who abandoned him in the ship that 
carried them to the New World.  Found by an African-American engineer 
(played by Bill Nunn), the orphan grows up with the crew as his family, 
hiding in the hold to avoid discovery by any social agencies.  Danny Boodman 
T. D. Lemon 1900, the first two monikers after his only father, soon begins 
to explore above-decks.  There's a quite amusing scene in which he's caught 
playing a grand piano in the ship's ballroom, in the dead of night.  
Although his talent is prodigious, he's told what he's doing is against 
regulations.  Here the kid tells what he thinks of regulations, the same 
obscene response he throws at anything or anyone he doesn't like.</P>
<P>It's right about now that we return to the music shop, as Max, played by 
Pruitt Taylor Vince, is the man relating 1900's story to the owner.  Max was 
a close friend of 1900's, a part of the ship's band, though he is now 
apparently giving up his trumpet - in fact selling it to the old Brit who 
runs the shop.  Having drawn out part of the story with an old record - a 
master matrix of 1900 playing one of his spur-of-the-moment masterpieces - 
the owner is enrapt, and the flashbacks continue.</P>
<P>When Max first joins the band, 1900 is 27 years old, and has never set foot 
off the ship.  He's like the symbol of the new baby each New Year's - except 
he resembles the new century - tough and sharp, yet somehow intimidated by 
his own potential.  1900 becomes a figure larger than life, a musician with 
an easy and formidable talent:  the others in the band occasionally ask him 
not to show them up.  The only problem is his naivete.  Since his 
abandonment, he has never touched dry land, and has no real idea of how to 
go about the business of living on it.  When he glimpses a girl who is 
watching him make the recording aboard the ship, 1900 is smitten.  Will 
there be a romance?  Will Max even talk his sheltered friend into taking the 
frightening descent down the gangplank?</P>
<P>The answer to these questions does not come without difficulty.  In fact the 
ending, as much as it functions as an answer, is too slow and overwrought 
with personal philosophy.  Tornatore should have cut a pregnant pause or 
two.  But oh, what comes before it - this is the stuff of a great movie.</P>
<P>We see inventive camera shots, some playful ones showing 1900's hands on the 
keyboard in multiples:  the man plays so fast that we hallucinate extra sets 
of hands.  Reflections of hands and eyes abound, and one shot shows the 
phantasmagoric world of the rich as they dance behind the windows that 
separate them from the souls in second class and steerage. Tornatore shows 
he is a visionary director who knows how to exploit fully the medium in 
which he works.</P>
<P>The language of early-century steamships is something we are familiar with, 
thanks to "Titanic."  In turns claustrophobic and expansive, the "Virginian" 
is a wonderful microcosm, a jumping off point for hundreds of thousands of 
immigrants.  The vessel serves as a character herself, a place where both 
death and life abound.</P>
<P>Of course music plays another important role.  Ennio Morricone  wrote the 
score, including some difficult hybrids of tunes that show off traits of 
ragtime, jazz and atonal modern - best summed up by one character's comment 
(though it's about Max's spirited trumpet), "When you can't tell what it is, 
it's JAZZ!"  What's most remarkable is how the script ties in music and 
narrative.  The motif of storytelling operates on so many levels in this 
film that it's impossible not to pick up the thread of one without following 
the trail of the other.  When Max asks his friend, "What the hell do you 
think about when you're playing?" we begin to understand that 1900 does 
out-of-ship composition:  he dreams of being in distant cities and wallowing 
in the beauty of natural land masses. Music, for him, is a way of telling 
the most personal tale possible, a free-associative fugue.  We feel pity for 
his plight, but 1900's self-pity never lasts long.  Soon he's the same 
superman of the piano.  In a gutsy tour-de-force, 1900 reluctantly engages 
in a duel with the so-called inventor of jazz, Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence 
Williams III). The way Morton is portrayed, even his mother would not like 
him.  A combination of a twentieth-century personality cult and symbol of 
the brutality of the world outside the metal womb of the ship, Morton puts a 
permanent fright into 1900.</P>
<P>As the title character, Tim Roth has perfect pitch.  Blending innocence and 
sureness, social awkwardness and friendly support, Roth is able to convince 
us for extended moments that this fable is real.  One bit of his behavior 
goes over-the-top when he falls hard for the girl - we need more hints of 
his intimate pathology to believe what happens.  Otherwise Roth pulls off a 
performance that makes us forget him in the roles of so many smirky tough 
guys.</P>
<P>I loved Pruitt Taylor Vince as Rub Squeers in the Paul Newman vehicle 
"Nobody's Fool."  Here he gets to show off a more realistic talent, a 1920's 
jazz trumpeter who wheedles his way into the band of the "Virginian."  Aside 
from breathing, Vince fakes his instrument playing well, down to the 
contortions and staggers of a hip horn blower.  Call him a long shot for a 
nomination for best actor in a supporting role.  The most touching bit he 
plays is the search for his long-lost best friend.  Some time in the 30's, 
Max left the ship and got back his land legs.  It appears that the 
"Virginian" was used as a hospital ship during the Second World War, during 
which 1900 stayed aboard and played on.  But now the ship is scheduled for 
demolition, and Max is convinced that 1900 has reverted to being a hermit 
within the hold.  Max's emotions during his search are telling and fully 
realized.</P>
<P>Giuseppe Tornatore engages in what might be termed slow-onset magical 
realism.  It takes a while for his artistic strokes to gather momentum, to 
coalesce into recognizable themes and symbols.  But when the jokes and 
motifs kick in, the viewer indeed experiences magic.  These moments make you 
want to whisper to fellow viewers to confirm the astounding power of 
subtlety.  But like the best phrases of music, it's best to keep these 
moments private, to store them among the few handfuls of cinematic essence 
that you carry with you everywhere, to take out once in a while and cherish 
like a toy from childhood.</P>
