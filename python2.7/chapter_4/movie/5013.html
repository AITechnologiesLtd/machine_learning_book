<PRE>                                CHILD'S PLAY
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  **1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1988)</PRE>
<P>        Every little kid dreams of having a doll that can walk, talk, and
play with him.  For Andy, the 6-year-old protagonist of the thriller
CHILD'S PLAY, this dream becomes a horrifying reality when his doll,
Chucky, not only comes to life, but also goes on a grisly murder spree.</P>
<P>        CHILD'S PLAY opens in a toy store with a dying serial killer
transferring his soul, via voodoo, into an innocent-looking doll.  A
struggling single mother, played by Catherine Hicks (who was the marine
biologist in STAR TREK IV), buys the possessed doll as a birthday present
for her son, Andy.  Much to his delight, Andy discovers that his new doll,
which he names Chucky, is alive; he can walk, talk, play, and much much
more.</P>
<P>        Trouble starts to brew when Chucky (possessed by the serial
killer's spirit) starts to murder people, and the police suspect that Andy
is responsible for the crimes.  No one will believe Andy, who claims that
his doll Chucky is the real culprit--that is, until Andy's mother discovers
that the doll has been operating without any batteries in it.  But before
she can dispose of Chucky he escapes, and in the remainder of the film,
Hicks and a detective, played by Chris Sarandon, team up to find and
destroy the doll.</P>
<P>        CHILD'S PLAY is fun, campy, not too gory, and at times genuinely
suspenseful.  Several tense sequences in the movie raised the hair on my
back, including the one in which Sarandon, trapped in his overturned car,
must fend off Chucky's attempts to kill him.  Thanks to convincing special
effects, the movie passes its most important test: the mobile and murderous
doll is believable and quite frightening.  Chucky's demented gaze and
sinister smile are haunting and will make you think twice the next time you
see a cabbage patch kid.  I was also impressed by Alex Vincent's
performance as Andy, the cute and gutsy little boy who must overcome his
mother's and the police's skepticism about Chucky's true nature.</P>
<P>        Although I enjoyed the humor, suspense, and premise of CHILD'S
PLAY, the film's lack of originality bothered me.  The gimmick of a doll
coming to life is reminiscent of 1978's MAGIC, which was about a
ventriloquist's homicidal dummy.  Furthermore, Chucky's knife-wielding
antics really aren't all that different from those of Jason in the FRIDAY
THE 13TH series.  My biggest problem with CHILD'S PLAY is its ending which,
although effective, seems lifted directly from THE TERMINATOR.</P>
<P>        Despite these problems, CHILD'S PLAY is certainly above average as
far as horror movies go, and if you're looking for some campy humor and
good suspense, then the movie is worth checking out.</P>
