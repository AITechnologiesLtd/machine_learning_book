<PRE>VENUS BEAUTY INSTITUTE
----------------------</PRE>
<P>Angele (Nathalie Baye, "An Affair of Love") works at the Venus Beauty
salon with her much younger colleagues Marie (Audrey Tautou) and 
Samantha (Mathilde Seigner, "Dry Cleaning").  Marie is a naive young girl 
being courted by an elderly widowed client (Robert Hossein, "Rififi").
Rebellious Samantha has too many boyfriends.  Angele, emotionally
hurt by a love affair which left her lover (Jacques Bonnaffe, "Lucie
Aubrac") literally scarred, promiscuously seeks one night stands. 
Then the young and handsome Antoine (Samuel Le Bihan, "Red") insists he
is in love with her and begins to follow her in writer/director
Tonie Marshall's 1999 Cesar Best Film winner, "Venus Beauty Institute."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Venus Beauty is a pink and blue microcosm of female society where males 
hover at the periphery of its harp chiming glass door.  Its chic owner
Madame Nadine (Bulle Ogier, "The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie")
advises Angele that she should own her own salon as she 'won't be one
of the girls forever,' yet Angele persists in her depressing, emotionally
angry lifestyle.</P>
<P>Ironically, for a woman who apparently seeks no relationship ties, Antoine
first falls for Angele when he observes her being dumped at a train station
by a weekend lover she clearly wishes to see again.  Angele treats the
impassioned young man horribly, getting drunk on their first 'date.'
Antoine rejects her sexual advances because of her agressive, unaffectionate
manner.  It's not until Angele sees Antoine speaking with Samantha in
the salon that she realizes she may reciprocate his feelings.  There's
another hitch, though - Antoine has a 20 year old fiance (Helene Fillieres)
who begins to shadow him just as he shadowed Angele.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, life in the salon goes on with customers such as Madame Buisse
(Claire Nebout), an exhibitionist who struts her buff stuff in the reception
area much to Madame Nadine's dismay and passersby's delight.  Director
Claire Denis is also on hand as an asthmatic massage client.  Samatha fights 
with Nadine and becomes suicidal.  Angele dissaproves of Marie's flirtation 
with Monsieur Lacheney until her and Antoine's spying upon the consummation of
that relationship fires their own spark.</P>
<P>Marshall's Cesar-winning script perfectly captures the life of the salon 
business and spins an intriguing subplot with Marie's April/December romance.
However it's main character Angele is a frustrating one - you want to reach
into the screen and shake her.  Her relationship with former lover Jacques
is perplexing.   Does she love him?  Did he dump her?  What keeps them from
entirely breaking their bond?  The ending of the film, which can be taken
at face value or seen as a fantasy, is not only downright weird but
terrifically unsatisfying as it makes you dislike the very conclusion you've 
been hoping for.</P>
<P>Technically, the film is terrific featuring strong art direction for the
shop (Michel Vandestien, "Nobody Loves Me") and fluid camera by Gerard de
Battista ("French Twist").</P>
<P>Acting is strong all around.  Samuel Le Bihan is a shaggily appealing
obsessive.  Newcomer Audrey Tautou is one to watch and plays beautifully
opposite veteran actor Robert Hossein, who never comes across as a dirty 
old man, but a courtly suitor.  Veteran actress Bulle Ogier shows just the
right amount of businesslike tartness peeking from behind her outward style 
and charm.  Baye makes us feel Angele's troubled emotional state by the 
strain we can see around her eyes.</P>
