<P>I was just telling one of my buddies the other day, about how there just
aren't enough air-traffic controller comedies out there, and the next thing
you know, boom...PUSHING TIN! Pretty amazing :) This film is director Mike
Newell's follow up to the critically acclaimed DONNIE BRASCO (8/10) and his
most popular film, FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL (8/10).</P>
<P>PLOT:
Ace air-traffic control man, Nick, finds himself a worthy opponent, in
Russell, the new air-traffic kid on the block. But despite Russell's obvious
indifference to Nick's competitiveness, Nick suddenly finds himself obsessed
by the man's enigmatic superiority, and slowly begins to lose grasp of his
professional and personal life.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Entertaining film that includes many funny moments, a roll of great actors
in top form, an original profession to dissect in air-traffic control, and
an overall feel of nothingness once finished viewing. I only saw this film a
couple of hours ago, and already, I don't remember much about it. That's
just the kind of movie it is. No huge moments, no huge laughs, but enjoyable
enough to see, and recommended on an even higher level on video. Now despite
its two-hour time clock, this movie never left me bored, and offered a great
mano-a-mano showing between the spry and cocky Cusack character, and the
cool and distant Thornton character. In fact, Billy Bob Thornton is the one
who really made this movie fun for me to watch. His character's ability to
thrive coolly under all of the pressure impressed upon him, was both
hilarious and inspiring to behold.</P>
<P>Kudos to Cate Blanchett for taking on a completely different role from her
previously Oscar-nominated turn as the Queen of England (She plays a perfect
Italian New York housewife in this one), and Angelina Jolie's breasts, who
put forth some of the greatest work by breasts in a film since the Jennifer
Tilly performances in BRIDE OF CHUCKY (7.5/10). I personally see a great
future for her pompons in the movie industry, especially when you consider
that they are attached to a truly great actress in her own right :) Cusack
is Cusack and jives perfectly as the fast-talking, smartass control man, who
eventually loses all control. The ending of this film was a tad cheesy, but
in a nutshell, its basic message expressed a need for external stimuli in
certain relationships, in order to jumpstart any stalled emotions. You'll
enjoy this movie if you're looking for something funny and less filling,
with an interesting insight into a profession that you don't know much
about, some fine actors, and a unique and humorous performance from Billy
Bob Thornton.</P>
