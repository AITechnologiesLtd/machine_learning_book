<P>After several years of making less-successful motion pictures (1999's 
"Cookie's Fortune," 1996's "Kansas City") that lacked the memorable nature of 
his earlier work, it was with a slight sense of pause that made me question 
if director Robert Altman was possibly losing his surefire touch. Although 
never losing his loose stylishness and quirkily realistic characters, 
Altman's last great film was 1993's "Short Cuts," which, in fact, beared a 
close resemblance to his most masterful achievement, 1975's "Nashville," a 
multi-layered expose of a week in the lives of twenty-four characters in the 
title city of country music. </P>
<P>With the aid of Anne Rapp's precise, accurately drawn screenplay, Altman's 
latest film, "Dr. T and the Women," is not only a thoroughly enjoyable and 
satisfying piece of work, but one of the better, more thought-provoking 
movies he has made. Richard Gere exquisitely stars as princely Dallas 
gynecologist Sullivan Travis ("Dr. T"), who, for as long as he can remember, 
has dedicated himself to the many, many females in his life. Women to him, 
you see, are all alluring and unique in their own special ways, and feels as 
if they should be treated like such. Because of his studly looks, intermixed 
with his kind, purely professional demeanor, Dr. T's office is constantly 
swarming each day with patients, primarily wealthy debutantes from Dallas' 
upper crust of society.</P>
<P>Tragedy hits close to home when his beloved wife, Kate (Farrah Fawcett), 
somehow snaps and acquires a rare mental disorder known as the Hestia 
Complex, in which the sufferer resorts to a virginal, child-like state. Also 
on his already full plate is the upcoming wedding of his cheerleader daughter 
Dee Dee (Kate Hudson), who may or may not be hiding her true feelings for old 
college friend and maid-of-honor Marilyn (Liv Tyler), much to the concern of 
Dee Dee's conspiracy buff sister Connie (Tara Reid). Also in Dr. T's life is 
daffy sister-in-law Peggy (Laura Dern), who can't go much longer than a 
minute without a swig of booze, and who has just moved back into his mansion 
with her three little daughters; sprightly office assistant Carolyn (Shelley 
Long), who secretly pines for Dr. T from afar; and Bree (Helen Hunt), the new 
golf pro in town who proves to not only be sexually-charged, but also a good 
listener, and whose very independence deeply attracts Dr. T to her.</P>
<P>"Dr. T and the Women" is an extraordinarily assured comedy-drama about a man 
whose very love for women has made him want to spend his entire life 
satisfying and making them happy. While many of his patients are overly 
materialistic, Dr. T's very nature is to be non-critical of each and every 
one of them, and to really listen to what they have to say. Additionally, his 
extended family, composed solely of the opposite sex, all love, trust, and 
rely on him, and this very fact makes him utterly satisfied. One of the best 
things about the writing, by Anne Rapp, is not only the way she truthfully 
portrays the female characters, but, like Dr. T, holds no preconceived 
judgments of the people that comprise the title character's entire being.</P>
<P>In what has become a token trademark of his, Altman paints his story and 
characters with enough shading and layers that something is almost always 
going on in the background, as well as the foreground, whether it be a subtle 
character idiosyncrasy, or an uneventful, superfluous string of dialogue that 
permeates through everyday interactions. Whatever it may be, this distinct 
filmmaking choice helps to develop and get the viewer to somehow come to know 
the characters better, even when they aren't given too much to work with on 
the scripted page.</P>
<P>The cast in "Dr. T and the Women" couldn't possibly get any better. Aside 
from veteran Richard Gere's star-making (yes, you heard that right) 
performance that makes you feel as if you are glimpsing him as an actor for 
the first time, the rest of the actors are no less impressive. In standout 
turns, Laura Dern (1996's "Citizen Ruth") is exceptionally funny and 
entertaining as joyful alcoholic Peggy; Helen Hunt (1997's "As Good As It 
Gets) thoughtfully underplays her complicated role as the idealistic woman 
Dr. T falls for; and Tara Reid (1999's "American Pie") is extremely likable 
and brightly cast as Dr. T's faithful daughter Connie. It should be quickly 
added that singling out the best performances in the picture is almost a 
pointless task, since everyone fits right into the proceedings, including 
Kate Hudson (2000's "Almost Famous"), touching as confused bride-to-be Dee 
Dee, Shelley Long (1995's The Brady Bunch Movie"), and Liv Tyler (1999's 
"Plunkett and McLeane").</P>
<P>Nearly flawless until its final minutes, in which Altman weaves a highly 
ambiguous surprise conclusion that could be interpreted any number of ways, 
but feels mildly disappointing in relation to everything that has come 
before, "Dr. T and the Women" is the best type of comedy--one that not only 
makes you laugh, but that makes you deeply care, too. Above everything else, 
this is a one-of-a-kind motion picture that treats all of its characters with 
respect and dignity, whether they fully deserve it or not, and never once 
attempts to pick sides. Too often, female roles in Hollywood are underwritten 
or unfairly looked over, but director Altman has always fondly treated them 
as intelligent individuals with thoughts, ideas, and a whole lot of heart. 
With "Dr. T and the Women," he has adoringly created a love letter especially 
for them, and in the process, made one of the very best films of the year. 
Way to go, Bob. Way to go.</P>
