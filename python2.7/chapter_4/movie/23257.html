<P>"Joie de vivre" (the pleasure of being alive) finds its complement 
here as the Joy of Killing, the pleasure of whacking others. Both 
joys coexist.</P>
<P>"The Whole Nine Yards" is a comedy (better yet, a farce) of murders. 
Funny films with corpses are a sub-genre of which the British "Kind 
Hearts and Coronets" with Alec Guinness may well be the most 
illustrious ancestor. Gangster comedies are not uncommon either. Even 
so, this new picture has so much to offer in characters that it is 
enough original and demented to create its own sub-sub-genre. That it 
has touches of Coen Brothers movies (and perhaps "Pulp Fiction") -- 
whether planned or a coincidence, conscious or not -- does not remove 
a thing from its novelty.</P>
<P>I don't think I've laughed so much at mayhem since John Waters's 
"Serial Mom" of 1994. Or chuckled along with the audience instead of 
feeling annoyed at giggles I find totally unjustified.</P>
<P>In a neat, higher (but not highest) income suburb of  Montreal (the 
real city, not a studio fake or a stand-in) dentist Oseransky, aka 
"Oz," lives miserably with his French-Canadian wife Sophie and the 
latter's first abandoned, then widowed mother.The ladies are nasty 
critters who bitch at hangdog-faced Oz for being this unheard of 
creature, a dentist with financial troubles.</P>
<P>Beautiful Jill,  Oz's dental assistant, was recently hired as it 
turns out (this is worked cleverly into the plot). She's lively and 
speaks to Oz with strange familiarity (there's a reason for this, 
too).</P>
<P>When a man moves in next door to the Oz home, the dentist recognizes 
him (don't ask) as  Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski, a contract killer with 
17 corpses to his credit. He had been a witness against his own 
Chicago Hungarian (sic) acolytes in the  deliciously named the 
Gogolak Gang.
Jimmy got away with just five years in prison. When released he 
haughtily refused the Witness Protection program.</P>
<P>Things get enormously complicated. Jimmy takes a shine to the 
trembling Oz. Greedy, imperious Sophie, convinced that the vengeful 
Gogolaks must have a put a price on Jimmy, dispatches the spineless 
Oz to Chicago so that he'll get a finder's fee.</P>
<P>What develops in the Windy City is enormously complicated as well 
funny. There is a kind of Commedia dell'Arte spirit of improvised 
situations, though I suspect they were carefully scripted.</P>
<P>The maze of characters who are not what they seem to be, and then 
some, includes a  huge black man (Michael Clarke Duncan of "The Green 
Mile") with delivers punches while beaming. He  towers over little 
Oz. The gang's leader Janni Gogolak speaks in a comically weird 
accent. Statuesque beauty  Cynthia adds more complications, has not 
had sex for five years (!) and is ... (no,  I won't reveal that).</P>
<P>When Oz returns to Montreal things get even more tangled up, what 
with Sophie having offered a contract on her husband (insurance money 
makes him  worth more dead than alive) to Jimmy, then to someone 
else. What with starry-eyed Jill meeting Jimmy and confessing that 
her dream was to become a hit-woman. What with escalating 
complications.</P>
<P>  It's a perfect cast: Amanda Peet, terrific, adaptable, likable. 
Matthew Perry, splendid as a victim-to-be mouse that does not roar. 
Bruce Willis, with his extraordinary cool. Rosanna Arquette with her 
phony accent. Natasha Hendridge who goes beyond the decorative. 
Michael  Duncan and his black humor. Kevin Pollak with his Pythian 
menaces.</P>
<P>The chain of people who want others whacked makes this is a  comedy 
of  killing grounds -- but its loony unreality, its super-spoof mood, 
defuse the violence. The complexities of this demented tale might 
confuse you, assuming you wish to apply logic -- but the brio is such 
that you don't give a hoot about who, what, where, when, why,  or how.</P>
<P>Some will call this a film noir, but it isn't really. Nor do its 
mostly sunny photography and sets use the traditional 
light-and-shadows and fog-and-rain "noir" look.  Even the excellent, 
discreet but effective score is light.</P>
<P>British  (born in Bath) actor-director Jonathan Lynn, schooled at 
Cambridge, and a nephew of Israel's Abba Eban, was, in the 1980s, the 
creator of the great, ironical Brit TV series "Yes, Minister" and 
"Yes, Prime Minister."  His feature debut was with "Clue" (1985).. 
There followed "Nuns on the Run,"" The Distinguished Gentleman,"" My 
Cousin Vinny,"" Greedy,"" Sgt. Bilko," and "Trial and Error." That's 
definitely a very mixed bag, from bad to mediocre. One factor in 
common which seriously weakened those movies was uneven tempo. The 
infectious "The Whole Nine Yards" has a first-rate, non-stop rhythm 
as well as many other virtues, including a first produced script by 
the otherwise unknown Mitchell Kapner. It's  a huge upward leap for 
Jonathan Lynn.</P>
