<PRE>                               PRIMAL FEAR
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Not being in the legal profession I am hardly in a position to
comment on the antics of the attorneys in PRIMAL FEAR.  I doubt that
lawyers visit the murder location looking for clues; they have
investigators for that.  But as sheer entertainment this is the film
to see.  For one thing, Richard Geer has never been as charming,
ingratiating and just a pleasure to watch in his role of a hotshot
lawyer more interested in seeing his picture on the cover of a
magazine than in defending a client . . . until he comes across
Aaron-Roy who is accused of murdering a very prominent Catholic
churchman, the Archbishop of Chicago.</P>
<P>     Martin Vail (Richard Gere) is the lawyer whose whole being is
devoted to always winning, to be the most sought after attorney.
Intrigued by the young man (Edward Norton) accused of the murder and
whom everyone believes is the killer, he decides to take the case
without a fee.  Thus begins a film that has more twists and turns, ups
and downs, all tense and exciting, than a roller coaster ride.  You
will love every surprise, of which there are enough for several films.
One of my favorites scenes is the very last when Vail is about to
leave the courthouse and sees through the door the crowd of newspeople
and photographers waiting for him.  I thought it was a great touch
that packed a big exclamation mark on an already stirring film.</P>
<P>     Mention should be made of the great casting by Deborah Aquila
and Jan Shannon, a category I have never previously mentioned.
Janet Venable (Laura Linney) is the prosecuting attorney who once was
"very close" to Vail and may still wish for a closer relationship is
exciting in and out the courtroom.  Alfre Woodard, a fine actress, is
perfect as the judge..  There is Andre Braugher (Tommy Goodman) as
Vail's investigator,  John Mahoney and Frances McDormand, all turning
in excellent performances.  Wow!</P>
