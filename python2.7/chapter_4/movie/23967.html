<P>Is Chicago thriving? More and more movies are shot there. In the real
city, not "Chicago-in-Toronto," "Chicago-in-the-Studio," and all
that. New releases include "High Fidelity" (a good title) and "Return
to Me,"  (a sappy title) which make good use of their location. They
could not be more different in content and style.</P>
<P>"Return to Me" is an old-style romantic comedy, the kind that a lot
of adults who may pass up action-violence-sex films, experimental
techniques, complicated stories, visual pyrotechnics, etc. would most
likely enjoy. Of course, I am not talking here about film-fanatics,
viewers likely to see a great deal of pictures in almost any genre.</P>
<P>It does not take a card-carrying movie nut to figure out "RTM." All
you need to know is that its stars are David Duchovny (Bob) and
Minnie Driver (Grace). The film starts by stressing unhurriedly how
very happily married a couple is. Bob owns a construction company.
Elizabeth ( played by Joely Richardson) is the Lincoln Park  Zoo's
specialist on big apes.</P>
<P>But since the film's female lead is Ms. Driver and not Ms.
Richardson, you may  guess right away that Elizabeth will have to die
in an accident. That's just what happens.</P>
<P>Cut to chronic bad heart sufferer Grace in a hospital bed, in a
life-threatening state. In crucial need of a transplant, she waits
almost hopelessly for a heart to become available. One does, at the
last moment. Yes, the heart is Elizabeth's.</P>
<P>A year goes by. Grace and Bob do not know each other. She is in fine
physical shape. He is inconsolable and almost reclusive outside his
work. Grace, of mixed Irish-Italian ancestry, is a charmer. She is
the apple of the eye of her grandfather Marty O'Reilly (Carroll
O'Connor) who has brought her up. Marty is the co-owner of O'Reilly's
Irish-Italian Restaurant (sic), along with his partner, friend and
chief cook Angelo Pardipillo (Robert Loggia). Grace waitresses there.
The partners dote on Grace, but then everyone around loves her.</P>
<P>In earlier times, Grace was presumably held back from boyfriends by
her formerly bad heart. Though healthy now she is haunted by the fear
that any future man in her life will stay away when he discovers the
scars on her chest.</P>
<P>Charlie, a colleague of Elizabeth's and a great friend of the couple,
has been trying in vain to get Bob out of his house. He finally
convinces him to meet Charlie and two girls (one a blind date for the
widower) at a restaurant. Guess which eatery it turns out to be?</P>
<P>An amusing chain of events brings Bob and Grace together. It's
attraction at first sight for both, with love not far behind.</P>
<P>Grace and grandpa live above the restaurant. After closing time,
Marty, Angelo and two old cronies invariably get around a table to
play cards and such and hold lively arguments about pop singers,
baseball and other matters. Now they also become matchmakers for
Grace. Egged on, the new twosome meet again and again. The
relationship blooms, not sexually however. Grace says nothing about
her new heart. Chest makes chaste.</P>
<P>The developments which will lead to the inevitable happy ending are
interesting and well concocted. Comedic actress Bonnie Hunt, in the
first movie she directs, does a very nice job of avoiding blatancy or
supercharged scenes. She also co-scripted. And also has a major
supporting role as Megan, Grace's best friend and confidante.</P>
<P>Megan, who has five kids, is married to burly Joe. James Belushi
plays him with perfect working-class realism. The small details of
life, tasks and duties in such a family come through convincingly,
and amusingly. As Joe attempts to get all his children to sleep
before he can make love with Megan, he exclaims "I'm trying to put
you to bed. And I want to get Mother to bed too!."</P>
<P>"Return to Me" is appealing. It also has a plot that hangs from a
thin thread, like Grace's life at the hospital, but the characters
are simpatico, believable and well-played. There are several funny
tidbits: a major "anonymous" donor to the zoo who keeps advertising
his anonymity;  Grandpa's having Grace meet a fellow "who also had a
transplant" which turns out to be a hair transplant about which the
man rambles on comically; an insufferable but comical blind date; and
other lighthearted scenes.</P>
<P>I could have done without a small number of setups. The film is not
free from clich=E9s. Hollywood has a thing about  " hyphenated
Americans, mainly Italian-Americans, Irish-Americans and
Jewish-Americans. One wonders where colorfulness ends and caricature
starts. On the other hand, give the movie credit for picturing
Charlie, the African-American friend, with no "minoritisms"
whatsoever.</P>
<P>Some details might have been skipped. Before meeting Bob, Grace had
sent him a "thank you for my heart" letter. But what revolves around
this is murky.  The matchmakers' eagerness is overdone. The music
track has a corny bit a la "Ave Maria" and a sudden phrase, just a
Hallelujah, from Haendel's "The Messiah.". It reminds me of the
saying that whenever a movie-maker does not know what to do next,
he/she can throw in a Hallelujah.</P>
<P>In Rome, Grace tells her story to a most unlikely waiter. She also
schleps from Chicago Bob's gift of a heavy bicycle -- this to a land
of sleek, racing bikes. Its only function, combined with some overly
cute nuns, is to be an artificial prop for the denouement.</P>
<P>But then, credit the movie for the subtle use of Bob's beautiful dog.</P>
