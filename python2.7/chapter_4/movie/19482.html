<PRE>Jawbreaker **</PRE>
<PRE>rated R

written and directed by Darren Stein</PRE>
<P>Darren Stein's "Jawbreaker" is a mishmash of a bunch of different
movies, including "Heathers", "Clueless" and "Very Bad Things". So why
can't it add up to the sum of its parts? "Jawbreaker" is the story of
a birthday prank gone wrong, when three girls fatally choke their
friend with a jawbreaker. The three most popualr girls in school must
then try to cover up their murder. However, instead of focusing on the
case at hand, "Jawbreaker" needlessly tries to become a lesson in high
school politics, and the characters carry on a lifestyle of excess(not
unlike the characters in "Very Bad Things"). At times, "Jawbreaker" is
sharp, but mostly it comes off as glib, derivative and
uninviting. Needless to say, Rose McGowan is dead-on as the head bitch
and Pam Grier is forceful as Detective Vera Cruz. "Jawbreaker" didn't
really hit any mass audience in theatres, and no mass audience should
seek it out on video.</P>
<P>Note: I know where Darren Stein went to high school, and it doesn't
seem to me that he could have got many of his ideas from there.</P>
