<PRE>The Nutshell</PRE>
<P>The story of a young woman caught between unwanted love from her
employer and a husband jailed in Africa.</P>
<PRE>The Review</PRE>
<P>    When you strip a love story down to its bare essentials, what do you
have? Funny sing-a-long scenes like in My Best
Friend's Wedding? No. A dorm room filled with pink balloons like in
Patch Adams? Nuh-uh. How about a grotesquely funny
Welsh flatmate like in Notting Hill? Not even close. When you look at
the heart behind a true love story, you are left with two
things; love, either wanted or unwanted, between two people, and the
circumstances that bring them together. While many
supposed romantic films are just chances for big stars to look cute
(think Meg Ryan in Addicted To Love), Besieged is a hard
look at doomed love; no silly sub-plots, no big stars to distract us.
Bernardo Bertolucci's new film is obviously different from
the rest of the pack, but perhaps it is too different.</P>
<P>    The story is simple to tell, but filled with deep emotions.
Shandurai's (Newton) husband gets imprisoned in an unnamed
African nation, and some time later she leaves for Rome to get an
education and a good job. She works as a housecleaner for
Mr. Kinsky (Thewlis), an eccentric pianist, while doing to night school.
Mr. Kinsky rather painfully loves her, something
Shandurai takes in stride, not wanting to leave a well-paying job.
Normally, this is about as much of the plot a critic will tell,
leaving all of the sub-plots and other bits to the viewer to discover.
However, the story of Besieged is so sparsely told that this
is almost all there is to tell; it is left to us, the audience, to
figure out what is going on. Once the film leaves Africa for Rome, the
narrative jumps forward to a point where Shandurai has worked for Mr.
Kinsky for some time. We know this for he is already
deeply in love with her, sending her flowers down the laundry-chute at
one point. The viewer's first conscious thought is "Wait,
when did he fall for her? Who is he and why is she working for him?
Wait, we aren't in Africa any more?".</P>
<P>    This method of story-telling can be useful. Many films explain
everything to you, diluting their story and distracting you from
the action; perhaps the only flaw in Hitchcock's Psycho is the
psychiatrist's lengthy explanation of what is wrong with Norman
Bates in the film's denouement. Other films leave out key pieces of
information, to provide a surprise climax. Several films this
year have used this trick, one to great financial success. Besieged
however leaves gaps in its narrative solely to concentrate on
the important parts. Thus, we have to deduce for ourselves what the
relationship is between Shandurai and Mr. Kinsky.
Making your audience think is not in itself a bad thing, but with a film
as layered and deep as Besieged is, so much time is spent
trying to put together what's happening that many subtleties go
unnoticed.</P>
<P>    Besieged is sparse not only in its narrative, but also in its
dialogue. Whole scenes go by where neither character speaks,
engaging instead in meaningful looks and glances. Had two lesser actors
been chosen for the roles, this lack of speech would
have buried the film. David Thewlis and Thandie Newton are both more
than capable at emoting through facial expressions,
however, creating an electrical tension between them. We hardly know
what Mr. Kinsky's motivations are, yet we are drawn
into the helplessness of his love anyway. The love story itself is a
raw, powerful one that is uncommon in the majority of films
today. Kinsky seems unable to do anything but love Shandurai. He knows
of her past, and of her husband back in Africa, yet
can't stop himself. He makes great sacrifices for her, very noble
sacrifices that threaten to ruin his own life, such is the power of
the emotions running through him.</P>
<P>    Bertolucci uses a filming style that, with the deliberate plot
holes, further serves to distract the viewer. He has chopped
frames out of certain scenes, so that one second out of every third or
so is missing. The result is a jerky, confusing movement
that seems more like art for art's sake than useful. The final effect is
one of consternation with the film. When discussing the film
afterwards, more viewers will be irately discussing the way characters
twitched around the scene than about how well-written
the story was. While no film can please everyone, Besieged could have
earned a lot more fans had Bertolucci laid off on the
flourishes a little. It is a real shame for this is one of the better
love stories I've seen in years.</P>
