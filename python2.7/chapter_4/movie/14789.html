<PRE>                      RUSHMORE (United States)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: Max Fischer, 15 years old, seems to have a mind of a 40-
year-old business executive who is also a playwright, but he can't pass
his classes.  This is an amiable ramble through the affairs and
personality of a not very believable character.  Rating:  4 (0 to 10),
0 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>   - Directed by Wes Anderson who directed BOTTLE ROCKET.  Made for
     Touchstone Pictures, though this is clearly not in the style of a
     Touchstone comedy.
   - Max Fischer (played by Jason Schwartzman) is a superb organizer
     who talks and acts like and adult three times his age.  He founded
     a dozen different clubs at his school Rushmore Academy and writes
     plays like a Broadway playwright.  The film follows several months
     of Max's life and his strategies to win an attractive first-grade
     teacher (Olivia Williams) as a lover and to befriend, then make an
     enemy of, then again to befriend a local business leader (Bill
     Murray).  That may make the plot sound more coherent than it
     seemed watching the film.  In truth you usually know where the
     film is, but it is hard to tell where the film is going or to
     remember where it has been.
   - Example: Max is trying to impress a teacher who likes fish so he
     hires contractors to construct a building to house an aquarium on
     the school baseball diamond.  He gets eight million dollars for
     the project from Bill Murray, but he never mentions it to school
     administrators.
   - Rarely clear what Max's plan is.  That could be fun, but it never
     seems to be.
   - Some of the appeal might be like the appeal of FORREST GUMP.  I
     did not care for that either but Max seems to have the same sort
     of luck.  He is like an intellectual Forrest Gump.
   - Another Luke Wilson film, my third of the festival.</P>
