<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>An atmospheric, thrilling whodunit, that is full of surprises, is fast-paced,
and is well-acted. 
John Brent (Stewart Granger) is a top executive in a shipping company whose wife
Nicole (Haya Harareet) has dramatically left him in front of his house guests
and executive coworker Charles Standish (Hugh Burden) and his wife Helen
(Stribling). She claims he must have another woman, as he is having financial
difficulties. But it's also clear she's fooling around with her interior
decorator, Clive Lang (John Lee), and with the medical doctor at the shipping
company, Dr. Alan Richford (Phillips). </P>
<P>Brent's financial difficulties abound because he's being blackmailed by a sleazy
looking, alcoholic dentist, Ralph Beldon (Bird). He was a prison dentist when
Brent served time as John Wilson and he doesn't want his shipping company to
know that, therefore he continues to pay the blackmail. </P>
<P>The plot gets twisted when the dentist is visited by a mysterious hooded
stranger, with a disguised voice, who threatens him to follow orders or else. He
relates that he knows he's blackmailing Brent; he offers him big money if he
gets Brent under sedation of a truth serum to reveal the combination to his
company's safe and to also get an impression of the key he has to the room where
the safe is kept. Things become complex in a Hitchcockian way when the heist
works and $130,000 is robbed. </P>
<P>Superintendent Frank Hanbury (Bernard Lee) is soon to retire, turning over his
job to his assistant, Tom Henderson (Montague), and he wants to make his swan
song clean--leaving no loose ends. But the case puzzles him as all the clues so
easily point to Brent, it's as if the ex-con has been framed. Therefore the
suspicions go to the wife and any of her lovers. </P>
<P>The complexity of the case made for a diverting mystery tale, as the fun is in
trying to unravel who pulled off the heist and who is the secret partner. </P>
