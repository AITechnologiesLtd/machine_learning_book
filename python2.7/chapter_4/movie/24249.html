<P>What starts as a frightening and stimulating psychological horror film, soon
turns into a primitive and brainless monster flick. And although it presents
some interesting ideas and some chills, it remains a waste of money and
talent.</P>
<P>Dr. Jennifer Pailey (Going) arrives home with her teenage sister Lisa
(McGowan) only to find the 400 residents of Snowfield Colorado missing or
dead. Most seem to have died or disappeared in the middle of their daily
activities with no sign that they knew what fate was about to strike.
Unnerved already, the pair are dismayed to find that the phone lines have
been cut and that their jeep which had been working a few minutes earlier
now refuses to start. Setting out on foot, they soon find three cops who
have just returned to the town and are now also trapped. Sheriff Bryce
Hammond (Affleck) with the help of two deputies including the slightly
unhinged Ben Wargle (Schreiber) has decided to investigate the cause of the
disappearances before calling in help. What they find defies explanation and
they quickly decide to make that call. But even with the help of two armored
transports filled with scientists, soldiers and an expert scientist who has
studied ancient mass disappearances (O'Toole ), they can not stop the
unstoppable and unknown force that has been unleashed. It is at this point
that the film takes an unfortunate veer away from psychological horror into
the less threatening monster movie genre.</P>
<P>I loved the way the first part of the film was structured. It began with a
surprising and shocking prologue and a chill that refused to leave me for
almost an hour. I loved the way the story was built, hinting on
extraterrestrial activities, forcing the viewer to look at the sky, while
the actual danger comes from the unknown depths of our planet. There are
some interesting ideas here. Like what it means to be a god. I got scared
and shocked and intrigued, but then...came the finale..I must admit that
after such an engaging and terrifying prologue you are all wired up and you
wait in anticipation for the resolution and explanation of these strange and
bizarre events. And when it finally comes, it's so disappointing and
primitive, that all you want to do is to turn off your VCR. An animal that
gets intelligence, memories and knowledge through eating flesh and can take
any form and shape of its devoured pray. That's an interesting explanation!
In comparison to this scientific discovery, "Godzilla" is a worthy Nobel
price winner.</P>
<P>The fact that you get to see Peter O'Toole and Ben Affleck play undeveloped
and immature characters in small, pale parts only makes things worse. The
"Scream"-veterans Going and McGowan seem more at home and, as you probably
can guess, their performances are not going to make it to the Oscar night.
The film manages to gradually build up suspense and horror, but falls right
on its face, when it is at its best. It is a strange combination of a
successful horror film and a stupid cliche-ridden monster story. In the end
it's nothing more than a mediocre horror flick, not worthy of your special
attention.</P>
