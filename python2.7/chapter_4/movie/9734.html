<PRE>THE LITTLE MERMAID</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: ***1/2 (out of ****) </PRE>
<P>Disney / 1:23 / 1989 / G 
Vocal Cast: Jodi Benson; Christopher Daniel Barnes; Pat Carroll; Buddy 
Hackett; Samuel E. Wright; Jason Marin 
Directors: Ron Clements; John Musker 
Screenplay: Ron Clements; John Musker </P>
<P>Disney's 17-day, special engagement re-release of "The Little Mermaid" 
proves that even their newer animated features can stand the test of 
time, even if only a scant eight years have passed since its original 
debut. Has it really been less than a decade? It certainly feels longer, 
because this 1989 hit made Mickey Mouse a mint and paved the 
crowd-pleasing way for such gems as "Aladdin" and "Beauty and the Beast" 
-- both of which, by the way, seem quite old themselves. </P>
<P>This loose adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen fable finds teenage 
mermaid Ariel (lovely voice of Jodi Benson) falling head over fins for 
land-lubber Prince Eric (Christopher Daniel Barnes, who has since gone 
on to play Greg in both of the "Brady Bunch" movies) from afar. Defying 
her father's wishes and ignoring the warnings of a chatty Jamaican crab 
named Sebastian (jovial Samuel E. Wright), she strikes up a deal with 
the evil sea witch Ursula (Pat Carroll) -- her voice for a pair of
legs. In makeshift human form, Ariel makes it on land but finds herself 
without a way to profess her love for Eric. </P>
<P>Although the male lead isn't as interesting a character as the female, 
"The Little Mermaid" has much strength in telling its simple story with 
brilliant fanfare. The colors are vibrant, the supporting creatures 
charming (even if Buddy Hackett takes birdbrain to the max as a dopey 
seagull), and the songs landmarks on their own. Although I consider the 
recent "Hercules" and "The Hunchback of Notre Dame"to be majestic films, 
I walked out of neither humming like I did with "The Little Mermaid."
Sebastian's pro-ocean jamboree "Under the Sea" is a production number 
yet to be rivaled, and the doo-wop ballad "Kiss the Girl" (connection to 
the current Morgan Freeman rape thriller is purely coincidental) is 
another high point. </P>
<P>But why "The Little Mermaid," and why now? Aside from a digital and 
audio clean-up, nothing has been changed or added -- no bonuses, no 
alternative ending (remember, Andersen's original was quite a downer), 
not even a cameo by Jabba the Hutt. The answer: Aside from the fact that 
it's a wonderful film, it's also the one movie that jumpstarted Disney's 
animated box office and made the public realize that cartoons aren't 
only for kids. "The Little Mermaid" deserves this kind of treatment. </P>
<P>Of course, there are those who will say the studio has polished up 
"Mermaid" for this special holiday engagement because its opening date 
bests "Anastasia" -- 20th Century Fox's first tread into Disney's 
animated musical territory -- by a week. But in a year that has also 
seen the theatrical resurrection of such corny tripe as Dirty Dancing, 
perhaps the question is less "Why 'The Little Mermaid'?" than "Why not?" </P>
