<PRE>                              DEAR GOD 1996
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                   2 :-( :-(  for answering God's mail</PRE>

Screenplay: Warren Leight and Ed Kaplan Cinematography: Charles Minsky</P>
<P>When a con artist (Greg Kinear) is given the choice of prison or
community service, it's not surprising he chooses service – being a
pretty boy. In the dungeons of a mailroom, he is given the task of
sorting dead mail, with an odd ball group of socially impaired
co-workers. When they take to the habit of opening ‘Dear God' letters,
and then answering them – i.e. giving away money, stopping suicides,
babysitting etc, they begin to find some common purpose in life.</P>
<P>So why doesn't this premise for a feel good movie work? Well there isn't
a specific reason why, just a lot of little annoying things that seem to
weigh it down. Like the constant whining of Laurie Metcalf (ROSEANNE's
sister), the general low IQ of the actors, the annoyingly tedious ways
of getting a miracle to happen. I know they're not angels, but at least
God has a plan. It's surprising that this severely, dysfunctional group,
are able to put a single constructive idea together between them. I
guess I should count my blessings, and include this as one of God's
miracles.</P>
<P>The movie then takes another tedious downward turn, when the City of New
York decides to take this group of muffin heads to court for answering
‘Dear God' letters. When they win the case and everyone starts rejoicing
in the city streets, one would have thought they had just discovered the
cure for AIDS. Now that would be a worthwhile miracle in response to a
‘Dear God' letter.</P>
<P>Greg Kinnear once again plays cute - something he does well i.e.
SABRINA, AS GOOD AS IT GETS. Whilst director, Garry Marshall, has chosen
an unusual subject material for his latest movie, far removed from the
PRETTY WOMAN stuff he is renown for.</P>
<P>In future, let God answer his own letters.</P>
