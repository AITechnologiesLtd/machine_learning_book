<P>     Often, one of the most overlooked elements of a film is its
cinematography.  Paradoxically, it is also the most important, whether
specifically noticed or not.  Movies are a visual medium where the
pictures shoulder the lion's share of the burden.  A movie can have a
good director, accomplished actors, and a riveting script, but if the
photography is done poorly, the production is doomed.</P>
<P>     VISIONS OF LIGHT is a fascinating film that will enthrall lovers
of movies and photography buffs alike.  For those that happen to fall
into both categories, it's a rare and wondrous treat.  VISIONS OF LIGHT
gives an insider's view to the job of the cinematographer, interviewing
dozens of today's most accomplished directors of photography, examining
their work, and looking back on the great productions of the past.</P>
<P>     I defy anyone who sees this movie to emerge with an unchanged
attitude towards the movies and the role of the cinematographer.
Likely the next film you see after this one, you'll be far more aware
of the role of the camera in the process of creation.  As a side
benefit, those that go into VISIONS OF LIGHT unclear about why
colorizing old films is such a taboo subject among movie-lovers, will
come to understand the reasons.</P>
<P>     VISIONS OF LIGHT states that cinematography is the art of light -
blending it so it enhances the director's vision of the film.  Much
time is spent discussing this subject as well as various other
technical aspects of the craft (the role of close-ups, the importance
of showing a performer from a certain angle, and the advantages and
disadvantages of certain shots).  If all this sounds dry, be assured
that it isn't.  There are clips from over a hundred movies to revel
in--everything from CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI to GOODFELLAS.</P>
<P>     The film is roughly divided into three sections.  The first, and
shortest, traces the early days of Hollywood and the importance of
camerawork in silent films.  Several of the interview subjects lament
the introduction of sound into the movies so early, feeling that
another decade of silence could have advanced their craft by leaps and
bounds.</P>
<P>     The second section deals with the black-and-white era after the
introduction of sound.  Covering roughly the years between 1930 and
1960, much attention is paid to the role of contrast and shadow (gray
versus black, for example) in these movies.  CITIZEN KANE is given a
lengthy treatment with its many photographic innovations discussed at
some length.</P>
<P>     Finally, color movies are presented.  From GONE WITH THE WIND to
films of the 1980s, the various techniques used by color photographers
to achieve moods and portray emotions are detailed.  During this part,
time is spent on movies such as ANNIE HALL, JAWS, BLUE VELVET, and the
aforementioned GOODFELLAS, which features a discourse on the genesis of
one of that film's most unusual shots.</P>
<P>     VISIONS OF LIGHT is somewhat didactic and doesn't attempt any
ground breaking documentary techniques.  But its mixture of information
and film clips keeps the pace reasonable.  This film will add a
dimension to the knowledge of those familiar with the work of
cinematographers, and give an appreciation of a different facet of
filmmaking to those who are not.</P>
