<P>   Funny thing. I hang around Broadway most nights every
week and I've never been approached by a ticket scalper
looking to pawn off tickets to a hot show at a 100% markup. 
Why is this?  Could it be that Mayor Giuliani has locked every
one of these guys?  Maybe.  But someone in the know tells
me that I just don't look like the type who fits the
demographics.  I don't know whether to take that as a
compliment. In any case, "Just the Ticket" is about a ticket
scalper and his cuddly-lovable business partners who might
have been created by Damon Runyon (whose works inspired
"Guys and Dolls") but who instead have been constituted by
writer-director Richard Wenk.  It's also about the scalper's off-
again, on-again girl friend, who comes across more like a
wary denizen of a small town in South Carolina than a
hardened native of the Big Apple.  I suppose the main reason
to see it is to find out how well Andy Garcia can play a nice
guy albeit an irresponsible scamp, and how precious Andie
MacDowell can be as the woman who waited eight years for
him to grow up and is about to throw in the towel and go to
the Cordon Bleu cooking school in Paris.  It provides an
energetic outlet for Garcia, who competes quite favorably with
Michael J. Fox in the role of a streetwise, fast-talking New
Yorker who makes his living hustling tickets for just about any
event that requires admission passes--sporting events,
theatrical extravaganzas, even in this case a visit by the
Pope to a sold-out Yankee Stadium.</P>
<P>   Selling tickets at a markup is legal, provided that the sales
are made by a licensed brokerage house and the markup is
within legal limits, usually ten percent. But there is an
underground market governed by sharks who buy up blocks
of tickets from their contacts in box offices and sell these
hard-to-get passes at huge markups.  This is about the only
job that Gary Starke (Andy Garcia) feels comfortable with,
since he is a rootless New Yorker who has no particularly
interest in accumulating property and is just trying to sell
enough of his illegal product each day to get by and pay the
rent on his Spartan Chelsea digs.  That's fine by his friends,
especially the oldest of his buddies, Benny (Richard
Bradford), a one-time prizefighter who treats Gary like a son
and works as his gopher, but it is not acceptable for his
girlfriend Linda Paliski  Linda is a gourmet cook running a
catering business, a woman who has been more than fond of
Gary for years now but who has taken on a bland new
boyfriend because she cannot see herself spending her life
with a guy who never bothered to get even a social security
card.  When Gary is not dodging the police and dealing with
his new ticket-selling street competition, Casino (Andre
Blake), he is eagerly courting the conflicted Linda.  Linda
would like very much to team up with him but has decided to
call it quits because his puppy-dog eyes and charming
personality are not enough to raise a stable family.  </P>
<P>   Romantic comedies of this nature are as easy to sell to
some people as tickets to the SuperBowl.  Others, though,
are apprehensive about the genre, fearing yet another picture
that is mawkish and manipulative with overly sentimentalized
characters and villains who may beat up the heroes, but not
convincingly.  "Just the Ticket" is unfortunately in the latter
category: a glitzy picture featuring photographer Ellen Kuras's
sharp New York City lensing and has only one scene that
works wonderfully on the funny bone.  That one is set in the
home of a rich matron, Mrs. Haywood, who hires Linda to
cook for her party but refuses to pay her the amount agreed
upon.  When Linda and Gary trash the kitchen they display
high-spirited chemistry between them for the only time in the
movie.  They roll the roast in a basket of kitty litter, add
Tabasco sauce to the Scotch, and fling eggs about the
room--all unnoticed by the hostess who by this time is quite
inebriated. Otherwise, "Just the Ticket" is formulaic, overly
sentimental, and designed principally to make the audience
feel good as it leaves the theater.</P>
