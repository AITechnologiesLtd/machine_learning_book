<PRE>                              THREE KINGS
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Set in the day or two following the
          Persian Gulf, THREE KINGS begins as a light-hearted
          caper film but turns into a grim view of the
          realities of the Middle East and American policy.
          This is an adult film, demanding but intelligent.
          A good film even if it is not always pleasant.
          Rating: 8 (0 to 10), high +2 (-4 to +4)  Spoiler
          warning: there are mild spoilers of the first
          quarter of the film in this review.</PRE>
<P>     It is in the hours after the cease-fire in the Persian Gulf War.
Iraq is still in a state of chaos and barbarity even as the war ebbs
from it.  We focus on volunteer soldiers, none of whom actually fought
but jubilant over the victory. Nevertheless their duty continues as
captured Iraqi soldiers are being strip-searched before being
interned.  One is found carrying a map in a well-protected place.
Sergeant Troy Barlow (played by Mark Wahlberg), Staff Sergeant Chief
Elgin (Ice Cube), and Private Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze) realize that the
map must show where the Iraqis have hidden gold bullion looted from
Kuwait.  They decide to make a little extra-curricular expedition to
liberate the gold for their own purposes.  Special Forces Captain
Archie Gates (George Clooney) has been escorting TV journalist Adriana
Cruz (Nora Dunn), but when he gets wind of the treasure map he decides
to ditch Cruz and push his way into the expedition and a share of the
gold.</P>
<P>     The village where the gold has been stored is a hotbed of Iraqi
rebels who have been promised American support if they would fight
against Saddam.  They are overjoyed to find four armed Americans show
up at last to help them defend themselves.  However despair returns to
them when Iraqi soldiers show up.  The leader of the soldiers offers
the Americans a compromise.  The yanks can take the gold and leave the
rebels to the Iraqi army.  They even are happy to help the Americans
load "Saddam's gold" onto the American vehicles in order to be rid of
the conquering army and to proceed with their sadistic duty against the
rebels.  The Americans are only too happy with the deal until Gates
realizes what his complicity in the betrayal of Iraqi rebels will mean.
He decides he cannot leave the villagers to their fate.  This sets in
motion the most deadly chapter of the war for the four volunteers.</P>
<P>     Essentially the plot could have been a Western with just a few
substitutions. However the plot is less important than the background
of THREE KINGS.  The film really becomes a serious political
examination of Americans in the war, America's clumsy and dangerous
foreign policy, and just how it affects other cultures.  In it bleak
characterization of political policy it stands with films like THE
KILLING FIELDS.  In the eyes of this film as the Iraqi government
suppresses and tortures its own people, the Americans blunder around in
quest of low oil prices.  Meanwhile opportunistic news reporters fight
for new stories of what is happening, losing interest once a story has
already been covered by someone else, trying to get ahead in the world
of news industry politics.  And even while this is happening people
like the Iraqis struggle to get American style appliances like blenders
and cellular phones in the callous struggle for another culture's idea
of the good life.  This is very dark and very angry.</P>
<P>     Adding to the deliberate pain of watching the film is the
photography of Thomas Newton Sigel (who filmed THE USUAL SUSPECTS).  He
intentionally washes out the color to give a feel of the hot sun to the
Mexican locales standing in for the Iraqi desert.  Occasionally the
photography becomes a bit gimmicky, predominantly in the more violent
scenes.  David O. Russell directs his own screenplay to be certain to
get each little angry note.  The Iraqi rebels come off the best, but
American policy, the Kuwaiti consumerism, the supposed stupidity of
American Southerners, and the Army bureaucracy, all get their turn
under fire.</P>
<P>     THREE KINGS may not be a pleasant film to watch, but it is
intelligent and certainly has to be the best film about the Persian
Gulf War yet.  I give it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the
-4 to +4 scale.</P>
