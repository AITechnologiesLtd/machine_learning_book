<PRE>MAGNOLIA
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>MAGNOLIA, by writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson (BOOGIE NIGHTS), is a
large and uneven collage of relatively unrelated stories with themes of
love and death, truth and lies, and guilt and redemption.  The best of
the segments are absolutely mesmerizing, but the worst of them are
seat-numbingly tedious.</P>
<P>The forecast for the San Fernando Valley on the day that the picture
takes place is "party cloudy with an 82% chance of rain."  But like most
motion pictures, the prop department never stocks umbrellas, a fact
which never ceases to amaze me.</P>
<P>Although the movie has a cast of thousands, the stories are really
individual ones.  To underscore this, the film's killer score starts
with a long and loud rendition of "One Is The Loneliest Number."</P>
<P>In a fascinating performance likely to get an Oscar nomination for best
supporting actor, Tom Cruise is Frank T.J. Mackey, a motivational
speaker for sex-crazed men who aren't getting enough.  The author of the
"Seduce and Destroy System," he preaches a take-no-prisoners approach to
sex.  A long-haired Cruise plays a man so stoked up that he would appear
to use cocaine rather than sugar on his breakfast cereal.  When he
demands coffee in one scene, the reaction is that, if ever a man didn't
need caffeine, it is Frank.</P>
<P>Anderson uses the dramatic theme music ("Also Sprach Zarathustra") from
2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY for Frank's introduction.  Bathed in light like a
rock star, Frank enters the room full of would-be world-class seducers
and lectures them on how to succeed with every woman they meet.  Frank
thinks with his private parts -- part of his anatomy that he teaches
must be "respected."</P>
<P>Generally Frank doesn't think much of woman as people, but he does see
some value in them.  "As we learn in Chapter 23," he instructs his
adoring male audience, "having a few chick friends lying around is handy
for setting up a jealousy trap."  Later, when confronted with the
reality of his parents, he comes completely unglued.  ("The most useless
thing in the world is what is behind me -- Chapter 3," he tells a
probing reporter who gets under his skin.)</P>
<P>Almost as good as Cruise is John C. Reilly as Officer Jim Kurring.  The
tender, shy cop hasn't had a date since he got his divorce three years
ago.  He looks for love with an unlikely date, a cokehead (Melora
Walters) whom he meets when she disturbs the neighbors with her noise.</P>
<P>Philip Baker Hall plays Jimmy Gator, the host of television's longest
running quiz show.  Jeremy Blackman plays Stanley Spector, the show's
current boy genius, and Michael Bowen plays the boy's obnoxious father.
(In a separate story William H. Macy plays a former boy genius from the
show.)  Once you learn that Jimmy is rapidly dying of cancer and that
Stanley needs to go to the bathroom but they won't let him, you can
guess some of what will happen on the show that day.</P>
<P>In the story's most uninteresting segments, Jason Robards plays Earl
Partridge, a man literally on his deathbed.  Robards, an actor whose
talents I find highly limited, gets way too much screen time for my
taste.  Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Earl's nurse, and Julianne Moore
plays his trophy wife.</P>
<P>Although the film starts with great momentum, Anderson loses it all by
dragging it out just past three hours.  The last hour, especially, is a
real snoozer.  Never even attempting to bring the stories together into
a satisfying whole, Anderson instead ends the movies with a ridiculous
conclusion introduced completely out of left field.</P>
<P>MAGNOLIA runs way too long at 3:02.  It is rated R for strong language,
drug use, sexuality and some violence and would be acceptable for older
and mature teenagers.</P>
