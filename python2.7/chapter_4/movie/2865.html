<PRE>                             NATURAL BORN KILLERS
                       A film review by Vijay Ramanujan
                        Copyright 1994 Vijay Ramanujan</PRE>
<PRE>Micky Knox: Woody Harrelson
Mallory Knox: Juliette Lewis
Wayne Gale: Robert Downey Junior
Also: Tommy Lee Jones, Rodney Dangerfield</PRE>
<P>     The plot: Two psychos ride around killing people.  No one's chasing
them.  No one really seems to care that they exist.  Oh, yeah, I nearly
forgot.  They were both abused as children, but mostly in black and
white.  A newsman wants to interview them and a prison warden wanders
around looking confused and sounding threatening, but not really saying
much worth remembering.  Lots of people get shot, some people get
stabbed, and some people even get punched to death.  Hitler marches on
Poland.  Don't ask.</P>
<P>     For years I have wondered how reviewers can pan a movie and give
it ratings of 1.5/4 or 2/5.  NATURAL BORN KILLERS provides the answer.
You must leave room on the bottom end of the scale for movies this
bad.  When it comes to ratings, NATURAL BORN KILLERS pretty much
defines the 0.</P>
<P>     First the positive.  Juliette Lewis salvages a part clearly
written by either two different people or by a schizophrenic.  She is
bashful, wicked, pleasant, cruel, harmless and vulnerable.  Yet,
somehow, she pulls it off.  Robert Downey Junior is great as a pyshotic
telejournalist who plans to make a bundle off of this pair of maniacs
by manipulating their image and interviewing them live.  Soundtrack was
nice, and I saw it at a discount theater.  Not much else to say here.</P>
<PRE>     Now the negative.</PRE>
<P>     Where to start?  When Janet Maslin said that this movie relied on
sophistry more than poetry, she hit the nail on the head.  The main
goal of this movie seems to be to prove to us what a great artist
Oliver Stone is.  He seems to have deluded himself into thinking that
if he can throw a million visuals at us in two hours, he has proven
himself to be the greatest director alive.  Only the strong will
survive.  Unfortunately, in trying to meet this aim, he overlooked the
portion of the director's handbook which dealt with relevancy.  Why do
we see Hitler's army marching in the background while Micky and Mallory
have sex?  Why is it necessary for Micky to watch the Oliver Stone
penned (and offensively racist) MIDNIGHT EXPRESS?  Who came up with the
idea of showing Mallory's breasts while Micky talks about why he is a
killer?  And what do the damn Coca-Cola polar bears have to do with
anything?  A lack of visual coherency doomed this movie from the start.
The visual elements rarely coincided with the thematic elements in the
movie.  Truly adept directors can carry off the odd visuals (David
Lynch, Tim Burton, Barry Levinson in TOYS) by making them a part of the
movie.  Stone did not do this.</P>
<P>     The second major failing of the movie was its basic
pointlessness.  My first, second and third reactions after seeing this
movie were "Who cares?", "Why did I pay to see this?" and "Can I get my
money back?"  I am hoping, for Oliver Stone's sake, that this was not
a satire.  It did not have the wit, the sarcasm, the subtlety or the
bite of good satire.  In fact, there was nothing in the movie that I
could latch onto as satire at all, except by the loosened definition of
satire that Oliver Stone seems to have hinted at in his interviews and
articles surrounding this movie.</P>
<P>     If it is not satire, what is it?  A powerful drama?  No, then it
would have been KALIFORNIA, a much better movie with a similar plot
(but no media types involved).  What that movie achieved through stark
realism and tight story-telling this movie loses in a diarrhetic wash
of tasteless jokes and pointless violence.  It fails as an indictment
of the media through medium more than anything else.  He is fighting
fire with fire, trying to criticize the media's sensationalistic
commercialism and sensory overkill through sensationalistic
commercialism and sensory overkill.  History has taught us that if the
media is to blame, than Oliver Stone is the guiltiest of all.  He seems
to criticize the media for creating murderer celebrities.  Well, he has
just created two more.  Offensive would be a mild word to use here, but
isn't that half of what the goal was?  At least I'm talking about it,
right?</P>
<P>     Now, I shouldn't delude you into thinking that if those problems
had been cleared up that this would have been a good movie.  In truly
great movies of this kind, there is an element of suspense.  This
didn't have one.  The portion of the movie dealing with the killings
has all the suspense of the baseball negotiations.  We know what's
going to happen, and frankly, we aren't given much to care about either
way.  Only one victim is on screen long enough to become something more
than another body to be thrown at the front row patrons, and even he is
reduced to another stereotypical portrait of the wise old native.  The
only tension between our two leads surrounds the fruitless question "Do
you think I'm sexy?"  This of course leads to some wonderfully
amateurish dialogue that any twelve-year-old will get a kick out of.
There is no element of chase, as the lawmen only enter the movie
seconds before the Knoxs are captured.  Once the murderers are
captured, the movie only goes further downhill.  There is no sane
character to offset the insanity of the leads.  There is no conflict,
as no one seems to really be plotting towards any kind of an end. (Let
alone the screenwriter or director.)  There is no drama, because all
realism has been cast aside.  There is nothing much to hand onto, and
nothing much worth watching.  This is not a movie ruined by bad
decisions, but a movie that should never have been made, made worse by
all the stupidity displayed by director, editor et al.</P>
<P>     But this movie does one positive thing.  It has added one more
rule to the list of rules that govern action/adventure movies.
Policemen must count to ten and sing the national anthem silently
before firing on an armed and dangerous criminal who has just started a
killing spree.  Yes, that's right, with a half a dozen or more guns
pointed at his head, our unarmed "hero" ... well, I'll leave you to
guess.  Need a hint?</P>
<P>     So what was the point of this movie?  Abused children lose all
sense of right and wrong?  It's all because of Geraldo?  That with enough
hype you can people to see just about any crap that you throw onto the
big screen?  I myself am thinking that it is probably the last one.</P>
<PRE>0.01/10
I'm in a generous mood.</PRE>
<P>     And just wondering.  Anyone else bothered that Stone used the clip
of O. J. before the man has even had a trial?  I guess that makes O. J. a
NATURAL BORN KILLER.  Trial by Oliver Stone?  Even the Puritans would
have flinched at the thought.</P>
