<P>   The United States may be the world's only superpower but
this country is hardly invulnerable to the machinations of
rogue states.  Even discounting a change of plans from the
leadership in Russia (who still fester about being second best
and surrounded by East Europeans wild about NATO), the
rogue states like Iraq, Iran and Libya may have their
strategies.  Those approaches center on non-nuclear
terrorism such as chemical and biological warfare. 
Amazingly enough, deadly bugs have not been unleashed
against the West, at least not to its knowledge, but that real
possibility gives "Mission: Impossible 2" its one and perhaps
only foundation for grounding and credibility.  "M:I-2" is not a
roller coaster ride but it sure is a excursion on motorcycles
and choppers and for fancy cars that have been made just for
the pleasure of blowing them sky-high.  A John
Woo ("Face/Off," "Hard Boiled," "The Young Dragons")
picture, "M:I-2" will probably be as popular in the 54-year-old
director's native Guangzhou as it is here in the West
because, after all, who can resist a video game that
surrounds its audience while bathing us in a torrent of sound
from waves crashing against the shore at Sydney harbor to
Hitchcockian birds flapping their wings to warn the villains of
the approach of the good guy to the ever-present rat-tat-tat of
machine guns that never come close to disabling the
superstar?</P>
<P>   Made in the James Bond style without the promiscuous
womanizing or the bevy of locations, "Mission: Impossible 2"
is filmed principally in the lovely city of Sydney, Australia with
an opening scene from Moab, Utah and an L.A. set design
resembling the arches and caves of Seville, Spain.  The
convoluted plot, which borrows a theme from Terry Gilliam's
"Twelve Monkeys," revolves around a scheme to infect
Sydney's three million people with the deadly Chimera virus
for starters, then to sell the antidote to those who have not
yet developed the fatal symptoms of the disease twenty
hours later.  As special agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and
his buddies Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Billy Baird
(John Polson) hone in on those hoping to use drug company
options to become richer than Bill Gates, they use Nyah
Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) the former girl friend of
villainous Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) to help in their
thankless efforts to save all the people downunder.</P>
<P>   Action-adventure films are difficult to evaluate because on
the one hand they may keep the audience on the edge of
their seats in spite of themselves (as this one does), but on
the other hand they are loaded with implausibilities (which is
OK), with same ol' same ol' formula (which is not), and with
that flagrant Ebertian flaw of the scoundrel's getting the jump
on the protagonist (at least twice) and failing to snuff him
because he's more interested in talking than in shooting (an
annoying flaw).  </P>
<P>   On balance, "M:I-2" is a disappointing foray, a generic
piece of very expensive filmmaking that lacks the
James Bond wit and eclat while at the same time highlights a
romance that is as sexless as it is inconceivable.</P>
<P>   Ethan Hunt got his name because he is the sort of guy who
must be unhappy when he is not working at hunting criminals. 
To emulate the chase, he risks his life on vacation by
climbing Moab, Utah's colorful red rocks.  Interrupted by his
Impossible Missions Force boss (in an unbilled cameo by
Anthony Hopkins), he is instructed to track down the evil
Scotsman, Sean Ambrose, who is concocting a plan to give
millions of people a bad, bad cold.  After tracking
down Ambrose's ex girl to involve her in the scheme, he
faces off against the criminals in more ways than one,
principally by the nifty use of rubber masks that have us
thinking, "Will the real Tom Cruise take it off and stand up?" 
There is more than a single leader with evil intents in this
drug scheme that involves the CEO of a pharmaceutical
company (played by Brendan Gleeson who was a helluva lot
better in John Boorman's "The General"), and that the bad
guys still tip off the heroes by affixing flashing counters on
their explosive devices.</P>
<P>   Dougray Scott makes the most of a role that seems made
instead for fellow-Scotsman Robert Carlyle, a fun-loving guy
when he's with his main squeeze at the racetrack but not at
all pleased when faced with his competitor for the gal and the
virus gun as well.  Cruise and Newton try to make like Pierce
Brosnan and Sophie Marceau but neither has the needed
panache for the romantic bits and in fact the adorable
Thandie Newton looks more like someone who's cutting
classes at UCLA Berkeley than a sophisticated jewel thief
who can pick a lock in seconds with a couple of sharp
instruments.</P>
<P>   The flamenco scenes are the best part of this escapist
excursion but we are privy to just enough foot stomping to
tease us and encourage us to travel to Spain rather than
Australia when school's out.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 123 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
