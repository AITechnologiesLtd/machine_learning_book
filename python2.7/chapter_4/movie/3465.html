<PRE>                                   PRIEST
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     The controversy surrounding PRIEST has been forefront in much of
the cinematic trade literature for weeks now.  Miramax, the film's
distributor, actually had the guts to release the movie, a powerful
criticism of Catholic doctrine, on Good Friday.</P>
<P>     PRIEST is the story of Father Greg (Linus Roachel), an idealistic
young priest in Liverpool.  The problem is that the young priest is
gay, and he's torn between his hidden, inner desires and his faith in
the church.  Add to this his mentor, Father Matthew (Tom Wilkenson), an
unconventional, karaoke-singing priest who is also breaking his vow of
celibacy, and a teen-aged girl who confesses to Father Greg the
incestuous abuse she experiences at the hands of her father.  Greg is
the victim of classic Catholic dilemmas:  whether or not to break the
seal of confession; whether or not to entertain his passion; whether or
not to remain a member of the cloth.</P>
<P>     The film is unrelenting in its prodding at the darker side of
religion, showing in painful detail the hypocrisy of many of its
tenets.  It's enough to make you seriously question what you think you
know, whether you're Catholic or not.</P>
<P>     While PRIEST is a jaw-dropper overall, it is lacking on a number
of levels that often make it frustrating.  The erratic pace of plot
development, stereotyping, and a substandard score make the film
sometimes awkward and forced.  Also, the characters seem to become
close friends (or lovers) for no reason at all.  Surprisingly, and to
much relief, PRIEST involves a huge amount of comic relief, such as a
funeral conga line, to break the omnipresent tension.</P>
<P>     Be warned, PRIEST is a graphic and taboo-breaking film.  It is a
forceful blow to the centuries of Catholic history, and tells a story
that is unique in every way.  Be sure you know what you're getting in
to if you go.</P>
