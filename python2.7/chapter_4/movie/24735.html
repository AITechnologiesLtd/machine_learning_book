<PRE>                           THE BIG KAHUNA
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: There is not a whole lot of plot
          in this stage play adapted to the screen.  Three
          salesmen come to a Wichita hotel to sell
          industrial lubricants.  Each of the characters
          is something of a cliche.  They talk about life
          and their dreams and their regrets.  The film
          really does not get very far, but the characters
          are interesting enough just to listen to.
          Rating: 7 (0 to 10), +2 (-4 to +4)  I give a URL
          where that great speech of advice from the end
          of the film can be read and savored.</PRE>
<P>     When American playwrights want to have a character in a
frustrating, thankless occupation they usually pick that of
salesman.  We have had Arthur Miller's DEATH OF A SALESMAN, William
Inge's DARK AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS, and David Mamet's GLENGARRY
GLEN ROSS.  Roger Rueff has taken a crack at the same field with his
stage play "The Big Kahuna," which he has now adapted for the
screen.  The plot of THE BIG KAHUNA is fairly minimal.  Two veteran
salesmen and a young representative from research come to a Wichita
hotel to sell industrial lubricants.  The three bounce off each
other as they talk about life, love, business, religion, death, and
each's history.  Almost the entire play takes place in one room with
little more than trimmings taking place outside the room.</P>
<P>     Lodestar Laboratories has sent three salesmen to a fancy hotel
hosting a convention in Wichita.  The three are to run a hospitality
suite.  Phil Cooper (Danny DeVito in one of his best roles ever) has
brought Tom Walker (Peter Facinelli) to his first convention.
Walker is not really a salesman, but was borrowed from R&D because
he had the right sort of image.  The pair is almost directly joined
by the supremely cynical Larry Mann (Kevin Spacey, reprising the
more nasty parts of his personality from AMERICAN BEAUTY), a
salesman with the personality of a thundercloud.  Larry goes
immediately into an angry tantrum because the food Phil has ordered
is not fine enough and the suite of rooms is not big enough.
Observing in timid fear is Bob.  As the three talk we eventually
find out about each of them.  Larry is intentionally crude and cruel
to get a reaction and to get his own way.  He has an unpleasant way
of turning a friendly conversation into a cross-examination.  He
analyzes and examines people around him like specimens on a slide.
Phil is nearly burned out and used up.  Divorced, he lives alone and
nurtures a death wish.  Placid and less intolerant than his long-
time partner Larry, he quietly sits and reads PENTHOUSE magazine
while Larry's storms blow over.  His job is most of his life now.
Young Bob is a Baptist with an urge to draw Christ into every
conversation.</P>
<P>     For any play that is really a filmed conversation, the rules of
plotting are different from most films.  The author only has to keep
the characters together long enough so something interesting comes
out of their mouths.  And THE BIG KAHUNA is a lot closer in style to
WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF and MY DINNER WITH ANDRE than it is
to most films you will see in a theater today.  The film sinks or
swims by how interesting the conversation is and what it tells us
about the people having it.  For much of THE BIG KAHUNA the style is
like the old Sunday morning TV plays that showed modern people in
distress and at the end of a half hour they would smugly point to
religion as the ultimate problem solver.  This almost seemed to be a
longer version of one of those plays.  Toward the end even Bob's
religious fervor comes under attack with a few well-placed verbal
shots.</P>
<P>     The play is written with more symmetry and stylistic
contrivance than is at first apparent.  Each character has a secret
fantasy we see enacted.  The dialog is good dialog and is
engrossing, but that is not the same thing as realistic dialog.
(Ask William Shakespeare.)  In this case the Rueff contrives to have
each of the characters laid bare to the audience.</P>
<P>     This is a film that will not be for all tastes, nor will it
bring in the audiences that an action film would, but it has its
rewards.  If it does not do great boxoffice, at least the production
costs were small.  I rate it 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the
-4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     Oh, and the great monologue of advice at the end of the film.
That is "Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)" by Mary Smich and
read by Baz Luhrmann, and you can find the words at
