<P>   Maybe the merchandising gimmick that targets films for
particular audiences should be abandoned, or at least
modified.  Market research people think that they can
determine what movies will appeal to distinct age, ethnic and
geographical groups.  Disney cartoons, for example, are
commonly intended for the small fry: parents are just nannies
who escort their kids to the animations to make them happy
and keep 'em quiet for a while.  Yet many adults are
fascinated by the simplest of these productions.  While a
case could be made that 5-year-olds would not appreciate
much in a Merchant-Ivory creation, the pros would probably
say that "South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut" would 
entertain people who are politically liberal, culturally
broadminded, under 35 years of age, distrustful of authority,
wary of Broadway musicals, with little faith in doctors,
government, the military, computer software, and the benefits
of life in rural towns.  They would probably have cable and
would have logged in quite a bit of time on the "South Park"
series.  </P>
<P>   I don't have cable, had never seen a single minute of
"South Park," am over 35, can live with authority, have much
faith in organized medicine, am addicted to computers, find
rural towns clean and quaint, appreciate Broadway musicals,
am not attracted to cartoons, and have faith that the military
will continue to fight fascism as it has done so well this year. 
How would I measure up? I'd probably get a rating of about
30% from the "South Park" suits who'd write me off as a
potential viewer.  What's more I read on the Net from a critic
I respect that in his Atlanta community, audience members
over the age of 45 began leaving the advance screening in
droves halfway into the comparatively brief production.  </P>
<P>   What a difference an hour or so makes in one's attitude
toward something new.  Perhaps my never having seen an
episode of the TV series was a good thing.  The movie came
across to me as a fresh display of good, dirty fun, so that
while a veteran watcher (like another Net critic I read)
concludes his review, "no more 'South Park,' please," my
feeling is quite the opposite.  I look forward to the sequel.</P>
<P>  The film opens on a pristine town, the sort of place that
could well be on the Canadian border.  The mothers dote on
their kids, the snow is pure white, and the people are
uniformly saintly.  Just a minute passes, though, when
director Trey Parker introduces the cynicism that informs the
entire script, which has been written by Parker together with
Matt Stone and Pam Brady.  The homeless are ignored in
this authentic redneck village whose eight-year-old kids do
their darndest to get into an R-rated movie, bribing a
homeless man with money for a bottle of vodka if he would
get them the six tickets they need.  The movie, "Asses of
Fire," stars the Canadian comedy team Terrance and Philip,
whose incessant vulgarity is picked up by the kids (just as the
MPAA knew it would be).  As the youngsters curse their way
through the school day, leading the authorities to call in their
parents and set up counseling sessions, one mother leads
women throughout the area in a demonstration against
Canadian film-makers, culminating in a declared war between
the U.S. and Canada.</P>
<P>   "South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut" is rumored to have
actually cut two or three minutes to bring it within MPAA
guidelines for a R rating--thereby avoiding the dreaded NC-17
assessment.  Trey Parker successfully lampoons the movie
rating board, doctors, Broadway musicals, parents, kids,
governments, the military, feminism, the school system, the
political correctness movement, Microsoft, idyllic little towns,
and liberal hypocrisy.  To do this in one of the briefest films
of the year requires a fast pace: "South Park" makes its point
in the crispest manner possible, relentlessly alternating
spirited songs with a flurry of ribald dialogue.   Though one
critic has said that "basing an entire film on vulgarity
suggests laziness," the sheer variety of skits belies this
judgment.  Fifteen songs, including the riotous "Blame
Canada" and "Mountain Town," inhabit this witty parody. 
While the subjects are sitting ducks for this sort of burlesque
(in one case a newscaster suggests that Canada has put out
peace feelers but here in the U.S. "as usual we're not
listening"), the obscene vituperations come from the mouths
of babes, making "South Park" a creative take on the genre. 
A considerable portion of the film--specifically the scenes
involving Satan and his relationship with Saddam Hussein--do
not work.  Saddam is so weakly lampooned that the Iraqi
dictator could almost clear the scenes for his country's TV. 
But generally, the dialogue, songs and colorful animation,
tossed at us in an energetic manner and rapid pace that dare
us to blink, make "South Park" an entertaining little treat
whose meanspiritedness might well bring smiles, guffaws--
even an occasional "oooo"--to your face.</P>
