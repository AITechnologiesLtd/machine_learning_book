<PRE>THE BIG HIT

Year of Release:         1998</PRE>
<P>Semi-spoof of all action movies, this film attempts to combine the
humour of Tarantino's scripts with the action of a John Woo flic. Mark
Wahlberg's theatrical follow-up to the highly acclaimed BOOGIE NIGHTS
(7.5/10) has Terrence Chang and John Woo of FACE/OFF (8/10) and BROKEN
ARROW (5.5/10) fame sitting on as executive producers.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Four professional hitmen, who happen to be regular Joes in "real life",
kidnap the daughter of a rich Japanese businessman, in order to extort
some large money from the gentleman. As per usual, the kidnapping goes
somewhat awry, and that's when the cookiness and action takes over. </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Flawed attempt at combining humour and action in one picture. LAST
ACTION HERO (7.5/10) was a film that handled this genre successfully,
but this picture just doesn't have enough real wit, or stand-out action
to merit that moniker. I laughed out loud at some parts, and cringed at
others (like when someone asks one of the hitmen how much money they
make and he replies "we make a killing"....haha, I think not). The
action sequences were all very good, but not enough were spread around
the entire picture. Also, the best scenes are in the first 10 minutes,
and then a very cool action scenario that rolls off the last 20
minutes.</P>
<P>Lou Diamond Phillips was the standout in the cast, whilst delivering a
bad guy rendition that flip-flopped between the Gary Oldman pimp in
TRUE ROMANCE (9/10) and Samuel L. Jackson in PULP FICTION (7.5/10).
Mind you, he did have most of the funny lines in this passable piece.
Wahlberg was so-so, as was the rest of this purposely generated
stereotypical cast. The soundtrack was very good, as was the style of
the picture, but I guess the biggest problem was its lacklustre script
(many weak attempts to correlate the idea of "bad guys doing regular
things" with successful screenwriting didn't pan out). If interested in
this story, I suggest you wait until it comes out on video, since
nothing of great interest is worth the trip to the movie houses for
this so-so adventure through the land of cinema.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
Christina Applegate was one of the last people to see late actor River
Phoenix alive the night that he passed away in front of the Viper Room
(Johnny Depp-owned bar in Hollywood) from an apparent overdose of
drugs.
Lou Diamond Philips' real name is Lou Upchurch, he was born in the
Philippines, and was left by his wife Julie Cypher in 1990 (after four
years of marriage) after she hooked up with singer Melissa Etheridge.
This film was China Chow's first film experience. She has modeled for
designers Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and was rumoured to be
dating Mark Wahlberg after the release of this picture.<HR>Visit JoBlo's Movie Reviews
