<PRE>                      THE HORSEMAN ON THE ROOF 1995
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
              2 :-) :-)  for being ripe with sexual tension</PRE>
<P>Cast: Olivier Martinez, Juliette Binoche, Pierre Arditi, Carlo Cecchi
Director: Jean-Paul Rappeneau
Screenplay: Jean-Paul Rappeneau, Nina Cornpaneez, and Jean-Claude
Carriere</P>
<P>There is something exciting about sex, when the players get to keep
their clothes on right till the end; and if there is a reason for
nudity, it is not to display the prowess of fantastic love making, but
for purpose and reason. The sexual tension, is so beautifully mounted in
this movie, that a gentle breath on the nape, can be as allegorically
erotic as a thousand kisses on the skin. This is a style that more
directors should learn to adopt. Being a French film, it also shows
commendable self-restraint.</P>
<P>The talented French cast includes Oliver Martinez, who plays Angelo
Pardi, an Italian of noble descent who is now living in exile. He is so
chivalrous, that he will brave the cholera plague to help a damsel in
distress. Hollywood, if not the world, needs more dashing gentleman like
this, to breathtakingly rapture the hearts of women who have lost faith
in the opposite sex. Then there is the beautiful Countess Pauline,
played by the stylish Juliette Binoche. Together, the duo, ride the wind
on stallions, shunning greedy soldiers and fleeing death.</P>
<P>This movie is set during the early 1800's, when the cholera plague
ravished towns in the south of France. Decaying corpses fill houses and
streets, as crows feed on the eyes of the dead. This is an unusual
setting for a love story, but the isolation and panic helps create a
breeding ground for respect to develop between the countess and her
champion. Although the ending comes too abruptly, it is easily forgiven
because of the overall lyrical style of the movie. When young lovers
meet, not even the world can stop them.</P>
