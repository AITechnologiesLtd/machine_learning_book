A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Tsui Hark</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Steven E. De Souza</PRE>
<PRE>Ingredients: 
Hong Kong, thwarting a plan to smuggle mini bombs, goofball agents, bad
guy named 'Skinny'</PRE>
<P>Starring: 
Jean-Claude Van Damme, Rob Schneider, Lela Rochon, Michael Wong, Paul
Sorvino, Carmen Lee, Glen Chin</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
In this Hong Kong comedy Marcus (Van Damme) and his buddy Tommy
(comedian Rob Schneider) are wheeler dealers in freewheeling Hong Kong.
They are V 6 company representatives running a factory for producing V 6
designer jeans for export to the United States, but in KNOCK OFF Hong
Kong is notorious for fake designer goods called knock offs.</P>
<P>One day the boys get a visit from V 6 investigator Karan Leigh (Lela
Rochon), accusing them of producing cheap knock offs instead of the real
jeans. Of course, this being an action comedy, this means that some
anonymous terroristic bad guys are responsible for making the fake jeans
and trying to hide microbombs inside them in a bid for world domination.
Enter the CIA, the Russian Mafia, Hong Kong mobsters, Hong Kong cops Lt.
Han and Ling Ho (Michael Wong and Carmen Lee), and of course, the
high-kicking Jean-Claude Van Damme.</P>
<P>Opinion:
For H.K. movie fans, KNOCK OFF features popular New York born Hong Kong
actor Michael Fitzgerald Wong, and model-turned-actress Carmen Lee. But
the main characters are Belgian kickboxer Jean-Claude Van Damme and
comedian Rob Schneider from TV's MEN BEHAVING BADLY. In this case,
teaming up a martial artist with a comedian for a buddy action comedy is
a good idea, since it takes half of the acting burden off of the martial
artist. Schneider is not a kung fu man or action star, and Van Damme is
better known for slow motion spin kicks, but luckily director Tsui Hark
and his team use judicious cuts and film speed to keep the action up
front and flowing.</P>
<P>Surprisingly, WAITING TO EXHALE actress Lela Rochon, playing company
investigator Karan Leigh, gets to do a decent amount of action work,
kung fu kicks, and machine gun shooting. As an action gal, Rochon
actually does well enough to get my fan vote as the next Bond girl or
Foxy Brown sequel heroine. </P>
<P>Teaming such an athletic cast of legitimately good actors with DIE HARD
scriptwriter Steven E. de Souza, you'd think KNOCK OFF would be a great
movie. But the bad news is, the plot is somewhat of a disappointment,
the dubbing is evident, and people chase each other around the city
without dramatic tension or character sympathy. If a building blows up,
it doesn't mean anything unless the building is somehow important to the
plot. Or if a character gets chased or bombed, the character should be
someone of significance to the movie, not a stranger. But in Knock Off,
a lot of action goes on without any particular meaning. For example, the
1997 Hong Kong handover is extraneously thrown in, but doesn't have any
significance to the movie.</P>
<P>In Knock OFF not as much attention is paid to the plot as to the
scene-by-scene choreography. When Marcus informs the police so they can
make a big raid on the big Russian Mafia boat, only one lieutenant shows
up to make the raid. Why? Carmen Lee plays another cop who is introduced
early in the movie, but fades away, so we never find out about her
personality or adventures, either. </P>
<P>Despite plot holes and characters the audience doesn't get to know or
care about, watching cops run around can still mildly entertain. But I'd
wait for the video unless you're a big fan of one of the stars or
choreography.</P>
