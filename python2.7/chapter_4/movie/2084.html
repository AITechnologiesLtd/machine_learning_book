<PRE>                                 JURASSIC PARK
                       A film review by Micahel Har-even
                        Copyright 1993 Micahel Har-even</PRE>
<P>     I wanted to forget my integrity and to write this review without
going to the film. Then, I have decided against seeing the film and
against writing this review. Finally, I saw the film and got 100
million reasons in favor of writing this review. Most of the following
ideas were raised before seeing the film. Those ideas should reflect
trends in the American cinema today. Watching Jurassic PARK reassured
me that I was right.</P>
<P>     Preston Sturges wrote many years ago the golden rules for making a
successful comedy. I would like to list those rules along with my rules
for making a successful commercial film. Naturally, the rules of
Sturges are much better. Here are the rules (my rules are inside
brackets):</P>
<PRE>        A pretty girl is better than a plain one.
        [A naked girl is better than a dressed one.]
        A leg is better than an arm.
        A bedroom is better than a living room.
        An arrival is better than a departure.
        A birth is better than death.
        [A death is better than birth.]
        A dog is better than a landscape.
        A kitten is better than a dog.
        [A Schwarzenegger is better than a dog.]
        A baby is better than a kitten.
        [A dinosaur is better than a Schwarzenegger.].
        A kiss is better than a baby.
        [A Spielberg is better than a dinosaur.]
        A pratfall is better than anything.
        [Technology is better than all.]</PRE>
<PRE>     Is technology better than all?</PRE>
<P>     Technology has no correlation to quality. Most of the great
masterpieces of cinema are either silent films or B&W films. The medium
of cinema is realistic by its nature. There should be no essential
difference between a silent film, B&W film or a colored film. The
availability of sound and color opened new ways of expression,
nevertheless, the aesthetic nature of cinema has not been changed since
the beginning.</P>
<P>     One might presume that technology could help to increase the
realistic effect. The truth is that realism cannot be achieved by mere
imitation or by restoration. Realism can be only achieved if the
director and the actors are totally sincere. Spielberg invested 100
million dollars in order to create realistic dinosaurs. The irony is
that his film is totally unrealistic. His film is like the Jurassic
park, amazing at first sight but totally phony. Whether 100 million
dollars or billion dollars are spent virtual reality cannot replace
reality.</P>
<P>     JURASSIC PARK is like a new candy. It seems to be tasty but very
soon you want a sweeter candy. You can enjoy a candy, but how can you
take a candy seriously?</P>
