<P>Starring Robert Carlyle, Emily Watson, Joe Breen, Ciaran Owens, Michael
Legge. Directed by Alan Parker. Rated R.</P>
<P>Few films in 1999 have divided the critical consensus as sharply as
Alan Parker's adaptation of Frank McCourt's memoir Angela's Ashes. Many
dismissed it as an humorless, sentimentalized, uninteresting version of
the hugely popular novel; others hailed it as a heartfelt, sincere
portrait of the human spirit. I'm somewhere in between, leaning
strongly towards the latter. It's certainly well-made and it never
becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be.
But I have a feeling that Parker filled the movie with pseudo-lyrical
shots of rain falling on the homely streets of Ireland just so it can
have the two-and-a-half hour running time that screams "I'm important!"</P>
<P>McCourt's book of the same name was about him and his family moving
from the US to Ireland in the early 1900's, a time when most people
were desperately trying to get into the US. As he comments, "we were
the only Irishfolk to say goodbye to the Statue of Liberty." In
Ireland, Frank (played by Joe Breen as a small child), his 3 brothers,
his mother Angela (Emily Watson) and his father Malachy (Robert
Carlyle) get financial help from Angela's mother, a stereotypically
strict Catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a Northern
Irishman.</P>
<P>She helps them get a rat-infested apartment and Malachy goes looking
for a job. Positions are scarce and when he does finally find one, he
is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking.
Meanwhile, Frank goes to an uptight Catholic school, where the
instructors beat students with blunt wooden objects as often as their
heart desires. Two of Frank's brothers soon die, crippled by the
dreadful living conditions and malnutrition. As if the poverty and the
suffering weren't intense enough as it stood, Malachy and Angela have
another baby, worsening the situation further.</P>
<P>I imagine this doesn't sound like much of a plot. That's probably
because it isn't one. These are people. This is their story. Director
Alan Parker (The Commitments) knows how to tell a good story and
Angela's Ashes, despite its relentlessly literary tone remains
interesting. Though the film occasionally indulges too much in its
gloomily picturesque Irish setting, it avoids looking like a glorified
travelogue.</P>
<P>Supplementing Parker's able direction are the engaging, often poignant
performances of the leads, some of them seasoned thespians, others
relative beginners. Carlyle, the charismatic British actor who has
shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick
comedy to the villain in a James Bond movie and now to sentimental
melodrama, perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character. We
empathize with the guy, but we don't like or admire him. Emily Watson
turns in a heartfelt, sincere supporting performance. It is mostly she
who implants that lump in our throats. Also worthy of mention is little
Joe Breen, whose face graces the film's superb poster. It is Breen's
first feature film and he's extraordinary as young Frank. Not unlike
sudden Oscar darling Haley Joel Osment of The Sixth Sense, you can peer
into the character's soul through Breen's sad eyes.</P>
<P>On the flip side, one thing that could have vastly improved Angela's
Ashes is a more decisive editor. While Gerry Hambling sure makes the
most of the scenery, he and Parker also leave in at least a half an
hour of unnecessary footage. The first half, especially, could have
been trimmed down, bringing the film to a more reasonable running time
and doing our bladders a favor in the process. Things pick up at about
the halfway point, sort of dismissing a lot of the criticisms I
accumulated during the opening hour, but I maintain that the
aggressively deliberate pace Parker and Co. set in the first half was
ludicrously unnecessary.</P>
<P>*Spoiler Warning! Skip next paragraph if in suspense!*</P>
<P>The film's final message is somewhat conflicted, as Frankie, in effect,
leaves his family famished in Ireland while he himself goes back to
America. What, exactly, are we supposed to make of that? His mother
doesn't seem to mind because she wants the best possible future for her
son, as any mother would, but it still seems inconsiderate of him. I
haven't read the book, but I'm sure that McCourt justifies his actions
therein; therefore, I'm suspicious. Another thing that's never made
clear in the movie is the meaning of the title, which, I'm sure, is
also explained in the memoir.</P>
<P>If seen as a film onto itself, rather than an adaptation, Angela's
Ashes stands tall. Despite a few minor setbacks, it is a captivating
story of people forced to live in the trenches by an merciless society
where those of weaker character are shoved to the bottom of the
financial ladder.</P>
