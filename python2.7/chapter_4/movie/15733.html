Showdown at Boot Hill (Reviewed on Nov. 26/98)</PRE>
<PRE>Starring Charles Bronson</PRE>
<P>"Showdown at Boot Hill" presents Charles Bronson doing what he does best: 
kicking ass.  Ever since I first became aware of Bronson, through the
"Death Wish" series, I'm always on the look-out for his films.  He has a
great screen presence, and you're always rooting for him.</P>
<P>In "Showdown at Boot Hill", Bronson plays a bounty hunter in the old West
who shows up at a small town to pick up a criminal.  The criminal refuses
to go, and draws his gun.  Of course, this being a Bronson movie, ol'
Chuck shoots him dead.  The only problem is this particular criminal had a
lot of friends, and nobody will admit it was actually him, thus preventing
Bronson from collecting his bounty.  So, he hangs around the town, waiting
for someone to come forward, while falling in love with the local spinster
in the process.</P>
<P>While there's nothing terribly original about the story, the Bronson's
performance more than makes up for it.  He plays a man who knows that he's
doing the right thing, but also knows that people around him mistrust his
motives.  Bounty hunters were not thought too highly of back then, but
somebody had to do it, I suppose.  </P>
<P>>From the instant he comes on screen, the audience is always on Bronson's
side.  We want him to succeed in his "mission", as it were, and we also
want him to find love with the lonely waitress at the local bar.  That's
what makes Bronson one of the true icons of American cinema.  He has that
rare quality that allows him to appear tough when he needs to, but also
sensitive around his friends and lovers.</P>
<P>Like Clint Eastwood, he's a true "man's man".  I only hope that he has not
given up on acting.  It would be a real shame if this legend were to die
without having won an Oscar.</P>
