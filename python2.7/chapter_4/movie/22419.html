<P>Once again, the Muppets feel the need to invade cinema screens once more.
After the mediocre Muppet Christmas Carol (I have yet to see Muppet Treasure
Island) the Muppet formula seemed to be getting a little stale. I was
therefore hoping that Muppets from Space, their latest outing, would be a
refreshed Muppet's for the millennium. Unfortunately, it's the same old
Muppet's we've known from the seventies. Granted, the routing is very funny
for thirty minute shows, but for the big screen the Muppet's should really
broaden their horizons.</P>
<P>The plot centres on the Great Gonzo (voiced by Goelz) who has always wanted
to know what species he is. Through a bizarre series of events, Gonzo learns
that he is in fact an alien. Unfortunately, an evil government agency led by
Edgar Singer (Jeffrey Tambor) also learns of the fact, and wishes to bring
in Gonzo for the inevitable painful probing. It's up to Kermit and the gang
to save the day.</P>
<P>Despite some bright moments, Muppets in Space is largely a failure. The
Muppets are more subdued than usual, and not all the Muppet's are given are
chance to light up the screen. Mainly Gonzo, Rizzo the Rat and Pepe the
Prawn are given much screen time, and although they are likeable enough, it
would be nice to see some more Kermit, Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear. Beaker
and Bunsen get most of the funny lines, while Kermit and Miss Piggy just
exist to push forward the plot.</P>
<P>Alongside the Muppet's are the usual human cameos, looking more embarrassed
than ever. Andie MacDowell has some fun with her role as a slimy news
reporter (perfectly suited to her) but the other cameos are decidedly
useless. Ray Liotta pops us a security guard and barely gets a laugh,
'Hollywood' Hogan has a funny but pointless few seconds on screen, and for
no apparent reason two Dawsons Creek cast members pop up for precious
seconds. I am sure that this has nothing to do with the fact that Sony (who
distributed this movie) produce Dawsons Creek.</P>
<P>There's also some movie parodies, including Independence Day and Close
Encounters of the Third Kind, but these are so obvious they are largely
pointless. Thankfully, the film largely resists Star Trek take-offs until
the final minutes of the film.</P>
<P>Despite the gloom, there are some good points. It's always nice to see the
Muppets on screen, and occasionally some genuine Muppet humour comes
through. There's a rather funky soundtrack featuring some disco hits. The
special effects are surprisingly decent. But there's just something missing
from this jumbled mess, and the film is never very funny or gels as a whole.
Maybe Jim Henson Studios are wandering since the death of Jim himself, but
something has to be done with the Muppet formula before it becomes so stale
that it dies.</P>
