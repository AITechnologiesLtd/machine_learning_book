<P> Author Susanna Kaysen's biggest problem was probably being born
in an era when conformity was the name of the game and well-to-do girls
who wanted to sample life on the edge or experiment sexually with more
than one partner were instantly labeled as mentally disturbed. That's
exactly what happened to Kaysen in the late 1960s, when she was packed
off to a psychiatric hospital following a botched suicide attempt.
Kaysen came out of the experience with a book, "Girl, Interrupted,"
which has become something of a touchstone for young female readers over
the years. Many of her fellow patients never came out at all.</P>
<P> Had she grown up in the 1990s, with her gifts for communicating
adolescent angst through language, Kaysen would almost be assured of
having a record deal or at least her own website. She was Goth before
anyone ever heard of the term.</P>
<P> There's no mystery as to why Kaysen's autobiography attracted
the attention of Winona Ryder. The role of Susanna fits the actress
marvelously, and her fans may even see Susanna as a continuation of the
smart, introspective teens Ryder played in such career-establishing hits
as "Beetlejuice" and "Heathers." And, after spending a large portion of
the last few years keeping a low profile onscreen, Ryder certainly must
be anxious to get back in the spotlight.</P>
<P> Unfortunately for her, however, there's an even juicier part in
"Girl, Interrupted," and it has gone to the exotic, unpredictable
Angelina Jolie. So while Ryder is baring her soul and facing off against
such formidable types as Whoopi Goldberg (cast as a stern but
sympathetic nurse) and Vanessa Redgrave (in a cameo as a psychiatrist
who pierces the clouds over Susanna's psyche), Jolie strides in and
steals the film out from under its star.</P>
<P> Jolie, who made a name for herself with a sensational
performance as an ill-fated supermodel in the 1998 HBO film "Gia,"
plays Lisa, an eight-year veteran of the hospital who appears to be
beyond treatment. She's a wildcat, flirting outrageously with both men
and women and generally creating havoc in any place she visits.</P>
<P> Because Ryder's boyish look here seems patterned after the late
actress and cult figure Jean Seberg, it's not much of a stretch to link
"Girl, Interrupted" to Seberg's best film "Breathless," the french New
Wave masterpiece in which she played a confused American who tries to
lose her own identity in a whirlwind affair with a Parisian criminal
(Jean-Paul Belmondo).</P>
<P> Susanna, like nearly everyone else in the ward, is initially
drawn into Lisa's orbit and savors the woman's boundless energy and
attitude. In just the same way Lisa overwhelms Susanna, the statuesque
Jolie dwarfs the tiny Ryder. But although Susanna eventually stands
tall, Ryder, fine as she is in the movie, cannot help but remain
eclipsed by Jolie.
 Ryder's work here is often affecting, particularly when she starts her
journey toward self-awareness in the story's second half. Jolie smartly
realizes Lisa is not a sympathetic figure and doesn't pander for the
audience's pity.</P>
<P> Instead, she's always withholding a little something, teasing
the viewer about what's really brewing behind this hellion's half-open
eyes. Eventually, we find ourselves worrying more about what's going to
happen to Lisa than about Susanna's fate; hey, we all know she went on
to write the book anyway, so things must have worked out somehow. Lisa
has mystery on her side.</P>
<P> The acting battle is the primary strength of "Girl,
Interrupted," which too often resorts to a melodramatic cliché (a
suicide, an escape attempt, etc.) whenever the plot stalls. All these
incidents may have actually happened during Kaysen's one-year "rest,"
but the screenplay doesn't make them feel real. On the other hand, there
are a few interesting touches scattered throughout the script, such as
Susanna's roommate's obsession with the "Oz" books by L. Frank Baum and
Ruth Plumly Thompson and Lisa's quoting of Dorothy Parker. True, these
kids may have some problems, but they've also got terrific taste in
literature. James Sanford</P>
