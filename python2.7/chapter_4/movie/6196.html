                         Roberta (1935)
                   A film review by Dan Navarro
                    Copyright 1996 Dan Navarro</PRE>
<P>        "Roberta" was one of the major musical triumphs of the
1933 Broadway season. Set in a glamorous Paris between the two
world wars, the play oozed romance, elegance, and continental
sophistication... or at least enough of those qualities to divert
attention from its absurd plot. A winning score by Jerome Kern
lifted "Roberta" several stratospheres above its banal libretto;
a good thing too, because without that boost, the show might
never have been translated to the screen to become the perfect
showcase for the talents of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.</P>
<P>        Reams have been written, and will continue to be written,
about the superb dance partnership that was Astaire and Rogers.
In their initial pairing as supporting players in "Flying Down to
Rio" (1933), they captivated the public, and soon became the
movies' most famous dancing couple. But a quirk of fate has,
until quite recently, shrouded what is arguably their finest
collaboration, in RKO's 1935 movie version of "Roberta".</P>
<P>        Because M-G-M bought the rights to the musical in order
to create its own version, "Lovely to Look At", in 1952, the RKO
movie was kept off television and off video dealers' shelves
until the 1990s. Whole generations of film fans have grown up
loving Fred and Ginger in classics such as "The Gay Divorcee"
(1934) and "Swing Time" (1936), without ever savoring the one
film -- "Roberta" -- that really established Astaire and Rogers
as superstars. But now, at last, "Roberta" is available to view,
to analyze, and simply to enjoy. This is dancing at its
endlessly watchable best.</P>
<P>        The plot, such as it is, concerns American football
player John Kent (Randolph Scott), who inherits his aunt Minnie's
successful dress salon ("Gowns by Roberta") in Paris. There, he
falls in love with the firm's head designer, Stephanie (Irene
Dunne), who turns out to be an exiled Russian princess in
disguise. Boy gets girl, boy loses girl, then girl storms back
like the cavalry in the last reel to save the faltering business
by staging a mammoth fashion show, complete with beautiful
models, and lots of singing and dancing. Finis.</P>
<P>        Fred Astaire plays Huck Haines, a struggling bandleader
and the hero's best pal. Ginger Rogers is Huck's old childhood
flame Lizzie Gatz, who is in Europe masquerading as a Polish
countess, Tanka Scharwenka. Perhaps because they have little
responsibility for carrying the burden of the plot, Astaire and
Rogers seem positively liberated in their roles, and their
dancing together seems more spontaneous than ever.</P>
<P>        Lizzie, using her fake title as leverage to persuade a
reluctant impresario (Luis Alberni), gets Huck's band a job at
the Caf=E9 Russe, where she sings as Countess Scharwenka. Then,
during a rehearsal session with the band, Lizzie sings the Jerome
Kern-Bernard Dougall ditty, "I'll Be Hard to Handle", complete
with phony accent and much sly humor... and in so doing, she
launches one of the great Astaire-Rogers dance duets. The song
is sweet and hot, two choruses and it ends, and we think the
number is over. But it isn't, yet. While the band vamps lightly,
Huck and Lizzie begin a friendly conversation, reminiscing about
the old days; then, in the most casual, spontaneous way, they
begin dancing together. Lightly they sway, then so gradually
that we don't realize it's happening, their dance becomes a major
musical event.</P>
<P>        Arlene Croce, author of a definitive volume on Astaire
and Rogers, says of "I'll Be Hard to Handle": "This is the big
event of the film, the number in which 'Fred and Ginger' became
fixed screen deities."  It certainly gets your attention. They
start with a rhythmic shuffle, then after eight bars he gently
takes her by the waist and together they spin around and around,
settling at last into one of the most brilliant and inventive tap
duets ever filmed. Halfway through the number, they separate and
have a tap "conversation", each taking a phrase, then each
responding with a salvo of taps. The band strikes up a bugle
call, and Rogers snaps to military attention, only to be
distracted by Astaire's invitation to resume their buoyant pas de
deux. They continue the breathtaking duet as the music rises to
a new wave of excitement; then, just as our hearts are ready to
burst with exhilaration, they whirl one last time and collapse
into two chairs.</P>
<P>        As satisfying as the number is, "I'll Be Hard to Handle"
seems to resonate with us out of all proportion to its value as a
screen event, to move us in a way few movie dance numbers ever
have. Now that we have videotape that can be played and replayed
endlessly, at last we can put our finger on the number's special
ingredient: The entire sequence -- three minutes of exquisite
skill and grace -- is filmed as a single shot, with no breaks in
the action, no skewing of camera angles, no interruptions in the
flow of the dance. Knowing that Astaire was a perfectionist who
sometimes demanded as many as eighty takes before pronouncing a
dance number fit to be seen, we can appreciate how pleased he
must have been with this particular take, to let it occupy three
minutes of uninterrupted screen time, with no cuts. And he was
right: This performance is perfection itself. There would be
other great dance duets by Astaire and Rogers, and by other
dancers; but prophetic title and all, "I'll Be Hard to Handle"
would be tough to top.</P>
<P>        "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" is probably the most famous of
the "Roberta" songs. In the film it is sung by Irene Dunne as
Princess Stephanie, and is later reprised as a romantic adagio by
Astaire and Rogers. Astaire once told this reviewer that he
didn't like to do love scenes -- and, sure enough, there are very
few conventional love scenes in the Fred Astaire oeuvre; he
always preferred to express his feelings for his partners through
their dances. His choreography for "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" is
like a love scene, treating Rogers both like a queen and like a
delicate rose. There is a moment where they walk side by side,
he pressing her head lightly against his shoulder. The dance
casts a powerful spell, but it is kept short, and it ends with us
wanting more.</P>
<P>        "I Won't Dance", another well-known standard associated
with the show, originated not in the stage play "Roberta", but in
a 1934 London musical, "Three Sisters". It had a different lyric
then (by Oscar Hammerstein II) but for the movie the lyric was
revised by Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh. This is the number
that Huck sings to a flirtatious Lizzie, explaining to her that
dancing just leads to romantic entanglements, and so "I Won't
Dance". But he protests too much, so two giant Cossacks carry
Huck to the dance floor, where he does a wonderfully inventive
solo involving tap dancing, jazz, swing, and several balletic
pirouettes.</P>
<P>        The climactic fashion show, showcasing the new gowns by
Roberta's dress salon draped on several gorgeous models (Lucille
Ball among them), is played out to "Lovely to Look At", a
romantic ballad written by Kern for the film. Irene Dunne sings
while the models parade their stylish frocks, and soon afterwards
the temporary conflict between Stephanie and John Kent is
resolved. The lovers embrace, romance is in the air, and it
seems to be contagious; even Huck and Lizzie make tentative plans
to marry.</P>
<P>        RKO, which was gleefully raking in the gate receipts from
the previous Astaire-Rogers film, "The Gay Divorcee", while
"Roberta" was in production, wisely chose to close "Roberta" with
a shot of Astaire and Rogers, the new superstars, rather than the
top-billed Irene Dunne. The die was cast. Cite "Flying Down to
Rio" as the first film to pair this extraordinary duo. Credit
"The Gay Divorcee" for being their first starring vehicle. But
salute "Roberta" as the film that finally distilled the essence
of Astaire and Rogers, and sent their lucky star spinning into
permanent orbit.</P>
