Heather Ankeny, Joseph D. Reitman</P>
<P>  Try to imagine "American Pie" without Eugene Levy and
"Road Trip" with Tom Green and you have some idea of the
quality of humor of "Tomcats."  As appropriately vulgar and
cleavage-filled as the two movies that Gregory Poirier is
trying to imitate, "Tomcats" has its moments of kittenish
humor but given its jagged breakdown into a series of
Saturday-Night-live style skits, each milked for vulgar
amusement, the movie simply does not purr smoothly along. 
Nonetheless, this is not the complete loss that a reasonably
intelligent audience might have thought it would be, but in
fact serves as a decent-enough counterpoint for those looking
for a bottom-feeder break from the magnificent arthouse fare
coming from Iran--although the spring break crowd might just
think that for their taste, "Tomcats" is actually too mild, too
good-natured despite its coarseness.</P>
<P>   If I said that this was too mild, that just goes to show how
far we've come from the bad old days that the Hollywood
code required a man and woman filmed in bed to have at
least one leg each on the floor.  </P>
<P>   Revolution Studios' first production is hardly an insurrection
but yet another feature that takes sophomoric humor from its
"Animal House" roots through the far better "South Park" and
"American Pie" to its present, near-dead end.  The story
revolves around a bet placed seven years earlier by the titled
tomcats, a group of hellraising fraternity types.  Each member
shells out a thousand bucks.  The last one to remain single
takes the kitty.  Invested wisely in high-stakes mutual funds,
according to the stockbroker type in the crowd, the kitty could
easily quadruple before someone wins the cash.  Naturally
the guy who thought he'd be single forever, Steve (Horatio
Sanz), walks (or rather, lumbers) down the aisle first and
shows up from time to time as the fellow who has reason to
suspect that his wife Tricia (Jaime Pressly) is carrying on a
lesbian affair.  The fun continues when just two guys are left
standing (not really standing all that often given the number
of women who fall into their arms regularly) to compete for
the money--which during the Clinton age of prosperity has
now reached into the hundreds of thousands.  When Michael
Delaney (Jerry O'Connell) loses heavily at a casino, he
becomes more determined than ever to win, but Kyle Brenner
(Jake Busey), who sees no reason to take the big step to the
altar, falls big for Michael's girl friend, the adorable Natalie
Parker (Shannon Elizabeth).</P>
<P>   What counts is not so much the principal tale of this mostly
kitty litter, but the attempts by scripter-director Gregory Poirier
(who penned the mostly underrated thriller "Gossip") to keep
upping the ante.  Easily the biggest gross-out occurs when
Kyle, who is diagnosed with cancer, undergoes removal of
the tumored testicle only to lead his pal Michael on a chase
down the hospital aisles to recover the part of his body he
wants to save.  As the renegade piece of equipment,
successfully removed from its scrotum, rolls and falls and is
ping-ponged from wall to wall, it lands in a doctor's bon bon
dessert--forcing Michael to substitute a nut (literally) and pass
this off in a bottle of preservative as the missing link.</P>
<P>   "Tomcats" may serve as a consolation prize for the jocks
who couldn't raise the scratch to go to Cancun during spring
break, but despite its occasional laughs, it doesn't give the
Mexican Tourist Board much to worry about.</P>
