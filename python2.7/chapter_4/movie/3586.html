<P>     Writer/producer Lauran Hoffman stated that the impetus behind BAR 
GIRLS was a desire to make a film showing the lives of real lesbians, 
and to expunge a certain Hollywood-generated image involving an ice 
pick.  It's therefore somewhat ironic that in attempting to create this 
honest, true-to-life portrait, BAR GIRLS has resorted to all sorts of 
traditional formulas and stereotypes.  The film takes an assortment of 
caricatures and throws them together into a comic, melodramatic mix that 
only occasionally works.   </P>
<P>     Hoffman and her co-producer/director, Marita Giovanni, deserve 
credit for the sincerity of their approach.  There's not a note of 
condescension in this film.  It takes homosexuality seriously without 
turning sexual preference into a soul-searching routine.  When one of 
the bar girls decides to put aside her affinity for men and try a 
relationship with another woman, it just happens.  There are no sudden 
sexual identity crises or moments of self-doubt.  One of the main themes 
of BAR GIRLS is that people are people, no matter which sex they choose 
to be with. </P>
<P>     The problem is that the message is superior to the medium of its 
delivery.  Even the gender twist can't invigorate this overused 
storyline.  When one character utters the line "Can this get any more 
predictable?", she could be talking about Hoffman's script.  At least a 
fair amount of the dialogue is interesting--the characters may be 
living the cliches, but they're not talking them. </P>
<P>     The main characters are Loretta and Rachel, a pair of upbeat 
lesbians played with energy and charisma by Nancy Allison Wolfe and Liza 
D'Agostino.  The two women meet one night at an all-girl bar, have a 
drink together, then head to Loretta's place.  They don't have sex, 
however.  Both are currently involved with other people, and Loretta 
needs to love her partner before getting physical.  Following a 
meaningful conversation, the pair decides that they enjoy spending time 
together, and plan to continue meeting.  Eventually, they sever the 
other relationships, admit their feelings for one another, and move in 
together.  It's then that things between them start to get rocky. </P>
<P>     While the core of BAR GIRLS is a reasonably solid, if 
unspectacular, romantic comedy, the satellite subplots are awful.  The 
business about a straight girl (Justine Slater) getting involved with a 
dyke (Paula Sorge) is poorly-conceived, badly executed, and horribly 
acted.  Fragments from the lives of some of the other bar girls are no 
more impressive.  One character in particular, a woman named J.R. 
(Camila Griggs), has the potential to be a fascinating and complex 
personality.  Unfortunately, she ends up as just another obstacle to 
Loretta and Rachel's happiness. </P>
<P>     As far as American-produced lesbian films are concerned, BAR GIRLS 
falls somewhere in between the inept-but-well-intentioned CLAIRE OF THE 
MOON and the playfully entertaining GO FISH.  Fresh romantic comedies 
are difficult to come up with regardless of the protagonists' sexual 
preferences, so BAR GIRLS resorts to safe, tired formulas.  The target 
audience will probably enjoy the result, but, for everyone else, it's 
hardly worth the effort of going to a theater. </P>
