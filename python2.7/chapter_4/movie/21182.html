<P>Once in a while, a movie will strike just the right emotional chord in
me and, for a time, I stop being a critic. Instead of studying the
various elements of the production or analyzing the subtext, I just
settle back in my seat and enjoy. "Trick" is one of those films. Sweet
and sexy, this gentle little romantic comedy boasts two lead
performances so charming that I simply didn't care to look for
problems in the film.</P>
<P>A number of other critics did not share my feelings. Many dismissed
"Trick" as superficial fluff and, despite giving it two out of four
stars, Roger Ebert seemed to take particular delight in shredding the
movie. On the other hand, Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman
awarded "Trick" an A- and Reel Views' James Berardinelli also offered
strong praise. How nice to see that at least a few writers saw the
same film I did.</P>
<P>Set in the Chelsea and West Village sections of New York City, "Trick"
takes place over the course of one day in the life of Gabriel
(Christian Campbell, Neve's brother), a songwriter with Broadway
aspirations. Gabriel is your basic All-American gay twenty-something,
perpetually sporting a smile on his wholesome, dimpled
face. Unfortunately, he is also a walking doormat. A textbook
people-pleaser, he allows his best friend Katherine (Tori Spelling) to
monopolize conversations with her self-obsessed babbling and routinely
vacates his apartment so that his straight roommate Rich (Brad Beyer)
can entertain lady friends, even if it means sleeping overnight in the
hall.</P>
<P>On the evening when Rich's "official" girlfriend is due to return from
a long stay in France, Gabriel kills time by bar hopping. During a
stop at a strip club, he spies Mark (John Paul Pitoc), a drop-dead
handsome go-go boy with piercing eyes, a phenomenal body and an
equally impressive basket (his nickname is "Beer Can" and it has
nothing to do with drinking).</P>
<P>Later, Gabriel encounters Mark on the subway and they briefly make eye
contact. When he exits, Mark follows and abruptly asks Gabriel if he
has a place where they can get together. And so the adventure begins,
as the guys encounter a series of colorful (and often maddening)
people on their quest for a bed.</P>
<P>Jason Schafer's screenplay runs the pair through a sociological
obstacle course, and along the way, their intended one-night stand
turns into something more, with the two young men getting to know each
other as individuals instead of attractive tricks. Affection begins to
blossom, building towards a closing scene as romantic as any I've seen
in a very long time.</P>
<P>It all works because of the chemistry between Gabriel and Mark, and
the considerable talents of Christian Campbell and John Paul
Pitoc. Campbell is good-looking in a fresh-scrubbed, Midwest way, and
he paints Gabriel as a likable man with a slightly nebbish quality
reminiscent of Jonathan Silverman back in his Neil Simon days. Beneath
Gabriel's polite, pleasant demeanor lies an insecure, body-conscious
kid who intensely fears rejection.</P>
<P>John Paul Pitoc is even more impressive. He gives a remarkably subtle
performance, ever so gradually revealing Mark's depth of
character. Initially, Mark appears to merely be a stoic hunk with a
blunt presentation style, but as the night progresses, he reveals his
kind, compassionate nature. In a particularly nice scene, he hops in
to help one of Gabriel's buddies save face with an ex-boyfriend.</P>
<P>Anyone attending "Trick" hoping for steamy sex scenes is in for a
disappointment. While the film is certainly erotic, the emphasis is on
courtship, trust and the beginning of intimacy rather than romping in
the sack. This is a film where hand-holding is electric and a simple
kiss feels like pure magic. The trappings may be contemporary, but at
its core, this is the kind of heartfelt romance rarely seen anymore.</P>
<P>Structurally, it is essential that circumstances keep Gabriel and Mark
from finding a bed and the supporting cast, particularly Tori
Spelling, energetically provides the circumstances. Spelling is
convincing (perhaps too convincing) as a pushy actress and singer who
is not nearly as talented as she thinks she is. Midway through the
film, the guys run into a tactless, overbearing drag queen who looks a
lot like a ravaged version of Spelling. I doubt the resemblance was
coincidental.</P>
<P>Even in my non-critical mood, I must admit that some of the plot
devices proved tiresome, but the central story between Gabriel and
Mark was so delightful that the flaws were easy to forgive. Does
"Trick" have problems? Sure, but those in the mood for a newfangled
spin on old-fashioned romance will find this a sweet and satisfying
confection.</P>
