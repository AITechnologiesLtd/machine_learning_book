<PRE>                            4 LITTLE GIRLS
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     On the morning of September 15, 1963, as Sunday School was in
session at the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama,
an explosion rang out.  Long time racially-motivated bomber Robert
"Dynamite Bob" Chambliss and a band of his followers had planted a bomb
in that church with the intent of inflicting maximum damage.</P>
<P>     The civil rights marches were in full-swing in the south and so
were the counterinsurgents.  These mad bombers that day killed Addie
Mae Collins (14), Carol Denise McNair (11), Cynthia Wesley (14) and
Carole Rosamond Robertson (14).  While Spike Lee was still in film
school, he began to plan a movie about the bombing.  Over a decade
later, he has finally been able to deliver on his dream with a
documentary, which he calls simply 4 LITTLE GIRLS, to tell the tragedy
of those children's early death.</P>
<P>     Spike Lee's publicist sent me an unsolicited press video with the
goal of fostering knowledge of the film and building demand that it be
shown more widely than it has been those far.  Even though it has
gotten rave reviews, it has only played in 9 major markets in the
United States, missing the Silicon Valley and many other regions of the
country.  (All of the revenue earned from the theatrical release of the
film is being donated to a memorial fund for the 4 girls.)</P>
<P>     From Spike Lee's very first movie, SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT, he has
demonstrated fresh and interesting approaches to standard material.
Although his DO THE RIGHT THING, for which he won an Academy Award for
the writing, is arguably his best known film, his picture MALCOLM X,
staring Denzel Washington, remains my personal favorite.  Spike Lee's
first documentary, 4 LITTLE GIRLS, certainly ranks among his best
films.</P>
<P>     At the time of the bombing Birmingham was a steel town with a long
history of labor violence.  In one part of the historic film footage in
the movie the Rev. Martin Luther King calls Birmingham the most
segregated city in America.</P>
<P>     Although much of the South by 1963 had begun to remove some of the
more blatant examples of racism, Birmingham still had separate white
and colored sections for lunch counters, cabs, restrooms, water
fountains, movie seats, bus seats, etc., ad nauseam.  The "Commissioner
of Public Safety," what a misnomer, was the infamous Bull Connor.  Bull
was fond of using dogs, billy clubs, fire hoses and even a tank to
maintain racial order.  These white and colored signs were not to be
treated lightly.</P>
<P>     Describing this era of insanity, the parents of the slain girls
tell their stories in retrospective.  Denise's father, Christopher
McNair, talks about Denise's childhood.  His most vivid and moving
recollection is a simple story of woe when he had to tell his hungry
daughter that he could not buy her a sandwich because the lunch counter
at that store was for whites-only, and it did not have one for
coloreds.</P>
<P>     It was a time when the moderate whites in Birmingham were just
beginning to assert themselves.  When a picture of white Birmingham
hooligans beating a freedom rider made the front pages of newspapers
worldwide, local Birmingham businessmen saw it in a newspaper in Tokyo
and said that something had to be done.  The film does not ascribe any
subsequent actions to these good intentions.</P>
<P>     "I say segregation now, segregation tomorrow and segregation
forever!" were the notorious words said by Governor George Wallace in
his inauguration address that year.  From that scandalous scene, Lee
cuts to today where an invalid Wallace points to a black man named Al
who he says is his best friend and who travels with him all over the
globe.  Wallace claims that when he was governor he provided free
textbooks for black students.  In contemporary interviews with
African-Americans they express doubts that Wallace ever believed his
racist rhetoric.  They said he was the nicest person you'd ever want to
meet until the cameras were turned on him, and then his inflammatory
rhetoric was an expedient.</P>
<P>     Starting small but expanding rapidly, the civil rights protests in
Birmingham grew into something that threatened the white power
structure.  The reaction by Bull and his crew was swift and
predictable.  The protesters were put in jail with hardened prisoners,
and even little kids went to jail.</P>
<P>     The big event for the movement was the tragedy of the death of the
4 little girls.  Their funeral was packed with mourners and reporters
from all over the world, who descended on the town to cover their
burial.  As Walter Cronkite put it, "This was the awakening [for white
America.]"</P>
<P>     The movie ends with Chambliss's trial a decade and a half after
his sickening deed.  Still laughing at the cameras, he is convinced
that he will escape punishment.  The film would have been better served
with more details of the trial, particularly the investigation leading
up to it.  Also, too much footage is devoted to names like Bill Cosby
and Ozzie Davis who show up mainly to add star power to the picture.
These, however, are minor quibbles.</P>
<P>     Lee's powerful film works best in the stock footage from the past
for no words can adequately describe what happened then.  From images
as simple as two drinking fountains, one labeled white and one labeled
colored, to ones as dramatic as a church in rubbles, the film shocks
the viewers with their country's own history.</P>
<P>     4 LITTLE GIRLS runs 1:42.  The film is not rated but would be PG
for mature themes.  The picture would be fine for any child old enough
to be interested in its subject matter.</P>
