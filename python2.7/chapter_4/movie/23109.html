<P>"You'll never know what you'll agree too when you're on fire!"
 And most will feel burned by this latest offering from the king of
action, Arnold Schwarzenegger. A trite and overly complex plot about
Satan's coming to Earth to father his son. A hodge-podge of ideas and
themes lifted almost verbatim from a host of other, better films.</P>
<P>1979.. a monk in the Vatican, recognizing a prophetic astrological
occurrence; alerts the Pope that the bride of Satan has been born. An
argument between the counsel and the Pope ensues, one side believing
that the Child must be killed, the other believing that she must be
protected. The Pope decrees, that the child must be protected and that
we must have faith in God.</P>
<P>As the child is born, An intern (Udo Kier) in a New York hospital
delivers the newborn to a group of Satanists in the basement of the
hospital  where she is fed the blood of a rattlesnake, the gathered
looking on in awe and enlightenment.</P>
<P>Flash forward 20 years to December 28th, 1999. As Satan rises up from
the city's sewer system (destroying a city block in the process), he
then possesses the body of  New York socialite (Gabriel Byrne) and
destroys another city block in a firestorm.</P>
<P>We are now introduced to Schwarzenegger 's character, Jericho Cane
(subtlety in names is not a concern here), an alcoholic and suicidal
New York detective. He is currently serving as protection for the
aforementioned Socialite. When an assassination attempt goes bad,
Jericho gives chase, hanging from a helicopter by a cable. Catching
and losing his suspect, the chase continues into the subway system,
where the assassin is caught and found to be Thomas Aquinas (Derrick
O'Connor) an elderly Priest, who rants about the end of the Thousand
years (a biblical reference to Christ's rule over the Earth).</P>
<P>Somehow, Jericho and his partner Chicago (Kevin Pollak) find Aquinas'
lair in the sewers. Amidst all of the religious scribblings and
newspaper clippings proclaiming the end of the world, they find a
newspaper photo of a young girl. We are then introduced to Christine
York (Robin Tunney) as she is approached by a street urchin, who
accosts her with warnings of an impending rape. As she grabs his arm,
the man shatters into thousands of pieces like glass. Christine
screams, upsetting the passengers on the train who have seen nothing,
as this was a hallucinations. Christine apologizes to her fellow
passengers for her outburst.</P>
<P>I'm not going to go into any further detail of this plot, since if
these already absurd situations haven't already eliminated any desire
you may have had to see this film, than nothing I can say in this
review will change your mind. Suffice to say, you have been warned.
For those of you that need to understand my complete dislike of this
film, let me continue.</P>
<P>The script by Andrew W. Marlowe (1997's "Air Force One") is hackneyed
to say the least. No research into biblical scriptures of any kind was
done, as made clear by the idea that our current time period is being
ruled by Christ ('The thousand years are over!"). As anyone who has
gone to church should know that Christ's rule happens after the battle
between heaven and hell.. But this is only the most minor of
convoluted ideas and plot contrivances retched up for this
Thanksgiving gift. The scripts' utter lack of knowledge of what
religion and faith is, (and for that matter what makes a good horror
film) are tantamount to blasphemy. But suffice to say, that this
Thanksgiving turkey is nothing more that baloney.</P>
<P>Christine is surrounded by loyal worshippers of Satan, who conspire to
make her the bride of their dark Lord. Why, we are not told. Why there
are two factions within the Catholic Church is also glossed over.
Every minion of Satan has superhuman strength, but can't survive
bullets. And Arnold can just walk into an armory and carry out more
weapons than the National Guard without the slightest protest. This is
a jig-saw puzzle type script. The mix of ideas and themes lifted from
films such as "Rosemary's Baby", "The Omen", "Godfather 3", "The
Devil's Advocate" and too many others to mention could almost
constitute copyright infringement. There is not one original idea or
concept here. This is just possibly one of the worst horror films ever
made by a major studio. Scenes from other films are lifted almost
verbatim. This is almost as maddening as "Godzilla" (which still ranks
as the most brain dead film of the 90's)</P>
<P>Arnold Schwarzenegger is horribly miscast as an alcoholic, self
destructive man. If anyone looked at the character as written, and
looked at Arnold's physique, one would assume that alcohol, consumed
in daily quantities of a gallon or more has the same effect as
Popeye's spinach. I found myself laughing out loud, at some of the
trademark Arnold one liners in this one, all about as subtle as those
used in "Batman and Robin".</P>
<P>As it is, the performances as acceptable. The surprise here is Gabriel
Byrne as the Devil in the Flesh. Without any other motivation that to
be as coldly evil as possibly, Byrne manages to have fun with the
part, drawing the only source of fluidity and fun out of this desert
of a script. Robin Tunney as the victim Christine York does what she
can with a role more under written than that of Byrne's. She does have
a presents on screen, and hopefully she can move on to better roles.</P>
<P>Kevin Pollak turns in the obligatory comic side kick role with his
usual aplomb. Nothing more, nothing less. The greatest miscarriage
here, is the utter waste of Rod Steiger as Father Kovak. His sole
purpose to spout out exposition to help explain a hopelessly muddled
plot. The rest of the cast does their jobs adequately, knowing full
well that in this film no one will notice the performances. This is a
fine example of film that relies on its special effects for any
entertainment it may have. The problem.. like everything else in the
film is we've seen them before.</P>
<P>The direction by Peter Hyams is similar to his work on both "The
Relic" and the Jean Claude Van Damme vehicles "Sudden Death" and
"Timecop". Neither praise nor pan, Mr. Hyams does what he does best,
and that's putting together an amusing action scene.</P>
<P>To sum up the experience of watching "End of Days", I'll quote a
dialogue exchange from the film.
Satan: I can give you whatever you want. Just tell Me.. what do you
want?
Jericho: I want.. you.. to go to Hell!</P>
<PRE>Yes indeed. For two full hours!
