<PRE>                             DON JUAN DEMARCO
                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1996 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>"Don Juan DeMarco" sprinkles fairy dust on the audience, and
in a mere 90 minutes casts a lovely spell. The British did it
with "Enchanted April," and now Jeremy Leven has written and
directed the kind of lighthearted fable that rarely flies free of
Hollywood's heavy hands. If that isn't enough, he has encouraged
his inspired cast to have a good time. They do, and so do we.  </P>
<P>The opening scene is a tone-setting treasure. Don Juan
DeMarco (Johnny Depp), clothed and masked as his mythical hero,
has lost the love of his life and is about to end his own--at 21.
He poses grandly on the ledge of a modern skyscraper, while Dr.
Jack Mickler responds to the emergency, his enormous bulk borne
skyward in the bucket of a giant cherry picker. Marlon Brando,
of course.  </P>
<P>We learn quickly that the inside of Don Juan's head is where
the eminent doctor wants to go. Why on earth would he want to
cure a man who is touched at every turn with romance?  Touch me
if you will, he says, with just a little of your magic. </P>
<P>In sessions with Jack, Don Juan's wondrous story unfolds,
gathering an irresistible momentum that carries Jack and the
audience into its spell. As he tells his tall tale, huge moons
shine, swords flash and brave men defend beautiful women. As he
listens, Jack bends under the weight of his own envy.   </P>
<P>By now, Jack is bringing bits and pieces of the spirit of
his exotic new patient to his wife Marilyn (Faye Dunaway), who
listens with bemused interest. "I feel we've surrendered our
lives to the momentum of mediocrity," he says of his impending
retirement to their flower-covered house in the suburbs. Little
by little, he takes her hand and they take flight. </P>
<P>Marilyn smiles on her enormous husband with radiant
affection. He adores her in return and revels in his rediscovery
of her. "I want to hear about your hopes and dreams that got
lost along the way while I was thinking about myself."  She cries
gently and replies, "I thought you'd never ask."  </P>
<P>Brando and Dunaway make pure magic of their scenes. Dunaway
is buoyant and subtle, while the massive Brando moves about with
the lightness of the reborn. Their deep self-assurance allows
them to turn their roles into a romp. They have fun together. At
once electric and playful, their presence fills the screen. They
sparkle.</P>
<P>Johnny Depp is just right as the romantic who has found the
secret to the tedium of life, just right as the poet who can pass
it along to the rest of us.  As Jack says to his colleagues who
insist on dealing with reality, "That's such a limited view of
the situation."   Don Juan's delusion has become Jack's romance,
and for a light and lovely evening, it becomes ours.</P>
