<PRE>TWILIGHT OF THE ICE NYMPHS</PRE>
<P>Canada. 1997. Director - Guy Maddin, Screenplay - George Toles, Producer 
- Ritchard Findlay, Photography - Michael Marshall, Music - John 
McCulloch, Production Design - Reginald Lebrie. Production Company -

Nigel Whitmey [uncredited] (Peter Glahn), Pascale Bussieres (Juliana 
Kossel), R.H. Thomson (Dr Isaac Solti), Shelley Duval (Amelia Glahn), 
Alice Krige (Zephyr Eccles), Frank Gorshin (Cain Ball)</P>
<P>Plot: Just released from prison and returning to his home in the land of 
Mandragora where the sun never sets, Peter Glahn falls in love with the 
beautiful but mysterious Juliana Kossel. Upon his return Peter finds his 
ostrich farmer sister Amelia engaged in a bitter battle with her hired 
hand who expects to be deeded the title of her farm. Zephyr Eccles, who 
has been abandoned pregnant by her husband, falls for Peter and gives 
her wedding ring to the ice nymph so that she might have him. But then 
the object of Amelia's desire, the sinister Dr Solti, arrives with his 
fiancee - Juliana - whom he has really hypnotized and made speak words 
of love to Peter. This circle of frustrated desires all comes to a head 
at once.</P>
<P>Canada's Guy Maddin is often alikened to David Lynch. Such a comparison 
is not really accurate and is probably born more of the lack of anything 
else that Maddin's work can easily be easily compared to. Certainly 
Lynch and Maddin have weird cinema pegged out between them. But where 
Lynch's work has a dark obsessiveness tempered with a kind of cod 
deadpan banality, Maddin's is all cod deadpan banality - which is about 
the only real point of intersection that the two have. Maddin's work - 
`Tales from the Gimli Hospital' (1989), `Archangel' (1990), `Careful' 
(1992), and this - feels as though it takes place in alternate worlds 
that have been constructed as kitsch homages to lost styles of 
film-making. Maddin is particularly fond of German cinema with his films 
frequently evoking Expressionism (the ghost of Dr Caligari surely hangs 
over the character of Dr Solti here) and Heimat cinema. At the same time 
all of Maddin's stylistic evocations are run over with what sounds like 
the hysterical purple prose from a bad romantic novel.</P>
<P>`Twilight' is set in another Maddin world that seems to have emerged 
from some kind of demented Wagnerian opera. As always in a Maddin film, 
the world is created with a deliberate stagey artificiality - all the 
sets look like they have been built for the enchanted forest in a 
high-school pantomime. The dialogue is suitably inscrutable Maddin-esque 
prose - "We are naked under these clothes," lovers solemnly proclaim. Or 
"When an agreement is signed it is time to chop down the trees"; and 
after Alice Krige gives Nigel Whitmey a purple negligee to wear: "You 
can wear my clothes until doomsday but it won't make you any more of a 
woman, just less of a man." The story is an amusing rondeau of 
frustrated wants among the various characters. Here R.H. Thomson 
intoning with an amusingly solemn sotto voce gravitas makes a memorable 
impression as the sinister Svengali figure Solti. Although in the end 
`Twilight' never quite strikes one with either the same sublime 
combination of stylized weirdness and melodramatic banality that 
Maddin's marvellous `Careful' did - it's more of the same but slightly 
lesser. The film has Maddin's largest budget yet - only about $2.5 
million would one believe - which allows him to shoot in colour for the 
first time and to employ name actors such as Shelley Duval and Alice 
Krige. </P>
