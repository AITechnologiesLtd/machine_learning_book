<P>Many would consider the career of the public school teacher to be
among the most thankless of occupations. Stories of idealistic
individuals slogging through warlike conditions are sadly common. This
setting provides the backdrop for this film, a searing dark comedy.</P>
<P>This film is clearly constructed to make a case for teachers. In the
film, as in real life, teachers must face numerous obstacles. Students
are apathetic, hostile, and even violent. Administrators are
ineffectual, and oppressively burdensome with bureaucratic policies.
Parents threaten litigation in response to attempts at discipline. In
reality the situation is universally considered a tragedy, and this
film, like many good works of literature, successfully spins comedy
from tragedy.</P>
<P>The story begins by introducing Mr. Walmsley (John Davies), a man with
a shady past connected with the circus. He accepts a position as a
substitute teacher in a suburban public high school, a world perhaps
more bizarre than the one he left. Being new, he finds that he is one
of the few whose spirit has not been broken down by the system. He
finds a kindred spirit in the art teacher, Ms. Germaine (Marsha
Dietlein). Each in their own way fights a losing battle in their
effort to make a difference in the lives of their students.</P>
<P>Eventually Walmsley realizes that there is no way to reach the
students within the restrictions of the existing framework. He
fashions an extreme scheme to address some of the most troubled
students. He uses his circus background to fashion a more severe form
of "detention", which is a common and ineffective punishment for
students where they are required to stay after school hours and sit
quietly in a classroom. It is only a slight form of punitive
imprisonment. The approach taken by Walmsley will be jarring to many
viewers, and director Andy Anderson states that it is meant to be
comically disturbing.</P>
<P>The strength of the film is that the comedy is consistent (the story
does not follow the cliche of becoming serious and humorless at the
climax), and the comedy is often quite clever. The film is also
unpredictable. Although the viewer is aware of where the journey will
ultimately end, it is never clear how it will get there.</P>
<P>The primary weakness of the film is the transparent agenda that is
being pushed. This could have been a problem if the film was not so
entertaining. The other minor detriment is some of the acting.
Although most of the adult roles were convincing, the students never
emerge beyond typical adolescent stereotypes. However, the film is
well written, and reflects the satirical wit of the filmmaker.</P>
<P>Highly recommended. The film sometimes uses jarring imagery, but this
is to be expected in a black comedy. It is imaginative and funny, and
it results in an enjoyable experience.</P>
