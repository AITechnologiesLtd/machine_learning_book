<PRE>                             BEFORE AND AFTER
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     BEFORE AND AFTER is a gripping story of a teenage boy in trouble.
His girlfriend was murdered, and he was the last one seen with her
before she died.  He has disappeared, and everyone is searching for
him.  His family closes ranks to support him, and his father even hides
what may be evidence to protect his son.</P>
<P>     From the director of the even more chilling SINGLE WHITE FEMALE,
Barbet Schroeder came up earlier this year with a thriller that will
terrify parents, especially those with teenagers.  The script by Ted
Tally, based on Rosellen Brown's novel, is full of problems and flaws,
but the stellar acting by Meryl Streep and Liam Neeson as the parents
more than compensates for its deficiencies.  They both give convincing
and empathetic performances and raise an otherwise pedestrian movie
into a compelling motion picture.</P>
<P>     The movie deals as much with the tensions within the family as
those surrounding the murder.  Even the father's brave but potentially
foolish evidence destruction is derided by the mother.  The mother,
Carolyn Ryan (Streep), tells the father, Ben (Neeson), "You can't just
destroy evidence.  What if you've destroyed evidence that proves him
innocent?"  When she gets tired of her husband's schemes, she cries
out, "I just want my boy back.  I just want to hold him again."</P>
<P>     The dad blames himself since he had fought with his son the
morning of the murder and thus "sent him out in a rage."  He has the
irrational hope that, "If we all keep quiet, maybe they've got no
case."</P>
<P>     In a good minor role is John Heard as their friend and initial
lawyer Wendell Bye.  Even better is Alfred Molina as the tough criminal
lawyer Panos Demeris, who takes the case when "mortgage lawyer" Wendell
begs out.  Demeris explains to the mother his take-no-prisoners
approach to beating the prosecution, and it infuriates her.  She scolds
him, "It's not the truth.  You're talking about opposing ad campaigns."</P>
<P>     Rarely believable are Edward Furlong as the son and possible
murderer Jacob and Julia Weldon as his sister Judith.  Both characters
are underacted and miscast.</P>
<P>     The constant music by Howard Shore is sweeping and sad.  The
cinematography by Luciano Tovoli makes you feel the cold snowy settings
and the effect the weather must be having on the characters trying to
cope with their misery.</P>
<P>     As the story develops, the noose tightens around the son before he
ever enters a courtroom.  The director's pacing is excellent, and the
tension ratchets up by the minute.</P>
<P>     I was really moved by the show as I think any parent will be.
Nevertheless, I would be remiss if I didn't give you a feel for some of
the illogical problems in the script.  Without giving away any of the
twists in the story, let me just say that: 1) the one time the parents
choose to make love in the story is ridiculous, 2) most aspects of the
Grand Jury testimonies make little sense, and 3) then there is the
show's conclusion.  Notwithstanding these flaws, the film works because
of the acting by Neeson and Streep and the well paced direction.</P>
<P>     BEFORE AND AFTER runs 1:48.  It is rated PG-13.  There is a little
sex, some non-gory violence, and a gory photograph.  There is no nudity
and the language is pretty mild.  The film would be fine for teenagers,
and maybe very mature kids a year or two younger.  I recommend the
picture to you and give it ***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
