<P>     "BARCELONA had its inception in 1983.... It was while editing
METROPOLITAN that I started reconsidering.... I found myself losing
interest in METROPOLITAN's nominal protagonist, the male-ingenue Tom,
and wanting to see more of the characters Taylor Nichols and Chris
Eigeman played...I had written METROPOLITAN under the conviction that
life is essentially an eventless affair and to make a movie full plot
and incident would be a false and unauthentic repetition of genre movie
cliches.  In the interval between the two scripts I changed my mind:
life does have its melodramatic turns, and, while melodramatic events
might not seem especially interesting in themselves, they could provide
another prism to examine the lives of the characters affected."
          - Whit Stillman, writer/director/producer of BARCELONA</P>
<P>     In BARCELONA, nothing goes quite as you expect it to.  In a broad
sense, certain things are played out as anticipated, but there are
always little quirks to be aware of.  Filtered through a somewhat
detached and ironic perspective, this film is the distillation of an
intriguing blend of romantic comedy, satire, drama, and philosophy.</P>
<P>     Whit Stillman's sophomore film seems a little like what one might
expect if British director Mike Newell and French filmmaker Eric Rohmer
combined on a project.  BARCELONA is replete with the loaded, pithy
dialogue that Rohmer is known for, as well as the dry wit which has
marked Newell's more recent pictures.  In fact, elements of the
epilogue are oddly similar to the fourth act of FOUR WEDDINGS AND A
FUNERAL, including the careful veiling of the bride's identity.</P>
<P>     The first half of this movie races past at a frantic pace, its
momentum gained more through its nearly-constant dialogue than because
of any significant plot development.  Things happen, to be sure, but
everything is on a small scale.  During the "last decade of the Cold
War," we're introduced to Ted Boynton (Taylor Nichols), an American
salesman based in Barcelona, and his obnoxious cousin Fred (Chris
Eigeman), a Navy officer.  Fred drops in on Ted unexpectedly,
announcing that he intends to stay for a while.  Ted, too much the
gentleman to say "no" to family, endures the unwanted intrusion.
Despite a fair bit of friction, the two manage to coexist, going out on
the town in search of love (in Ted's case) and sex (in Fred's).  What
they find is a group of attractive trade-fair girls and a match for
each of them--or so it seems.</P>
<P>     The best moments in BARCELONA involve snippets of offbeat
conversations about mundane facets of life.  Some of these--like
Fred's musings about the "correct" way to shave--are completely
facetious, but others are designed to provoke a moment's genuine
thought, such as Ted and Ramon's opposing views on the importance of
physical beauty.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, the second half of the movie can't match the level
of what preceded it.  As the plot gains prominence, some of BARCELONA's
unique freshness dissipates.  For the last thirty minutes, the script
settles into a fairly routine dramatic pattern.</P>
<P>     The acting is done mostly by low-profile performers.  Taylor
Nichols and Chris Eigeman both appeared in Stillman's METROPOLITAN and
Mira Sorvino (the daughter of Paul Sorvino) had her screen debut in
AMONGST FRIENDS.  Their work is consistently strong, especially that of
the two leads, who manage to bring life to a modern-day ODD COUPLE.</P>
<P>     BARCELONA is one of those movies that contains just about
everything (and a lot of it) except action.  The plot is a vehicle for
the characters (and their intelligently-scripted dialogue)--a method,
as Stillman says, of viewing different aspects of Ted and Fred's
lives.  However, while the film's initial charm may lie in its humorous
perspective of this pair of mismatched cousins, its lasting impression
(for men at least) may involve wondering exactly how to hold the
razor.</P>
