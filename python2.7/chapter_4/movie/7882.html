<PRE>                               HAPPY GILMORE
                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>** (out of 4 = fair)
1996, PG-13, 91 minutes [1 hour, 31 minutes]
[comedy]
starring; Adam Sandler (Happy Gilmore), Carl Weathers (Chubbs) Christopher
McDonald (Shooter McGavin), Julie Bowen (Virgina), Frances Bay (Grandma),
written by Tim Herlihy, Adam Sandler, produced by Robert Simonds, directed by
Dennis Ducan.</P>
<P>Adam Sandler is a young man full of energy and comic wit. His first film,
"Billy Madison," was wild and unpredictable, but "Happy Gilmore," his
follow-up is trite and cliche. I kept thinking "I know I've seen this
before," and kept predicting all the jokes because of that feeling. This is
another typical screwball sports comedy with a stupid villain and a deadline
for a huge amount of cash.</P>
<P>Happy Gilmore (Sandler) is spoiled idiot manchild (wonder where I've seen
this before?) who lives with his grandmother (Bay) who he actually cares for.
He loves hockey but really stinks at it and can't comprehend his failure at th
e game. One day the I.R.S. comes to his grandmother's house and repossess all
of her property because she hasn't paid her taxes in ten years. This is told,
blatantly, quickly, and so dumbed down it's almost a children's story, and a
bad one at that. </P>
<P>There is a quick, token sports comedy scene in which we discover Happy has a
hidden talent of hitting golf balls very far. When he goes to the local
driving range he is seen by a retired golf pro named Chubbs (Weathers), who
of course tells him he's gifted, and tries to convince him to go pro, but of
course Happy doesn't listen until Chubbs mentions he could make money playing
golf... could this get any more predictable?</P>
<P>Most of the movie depicts Happy's struggle to make it to the top. Along the
way we watch him beat up other players, hecklers, his caddy, even Bob Barker.
And then there is Shooter McGavin (McDonald), the arrogant pro who feels
threatened by Happy and wants him kicked out of the sport. Let's not forget
the sexy-woman-who-won't-give-the-main-character-the-time-of-day, Virgina
(Bowen), the PGA publicist who both of the men try to impress. </P>
<P>Cliche after cliche after cliche is not a good formula for a movie, truly
good movies always do something different. Yes, "Billy Madison" was cliche,
but it was much funnier because of it's total wackiness and craziness. This
isn't wacky, this is just plain dumb.</P>
<P>Do I have to reveal the ending? I don't think so. </P>
<P>"Happy Gilmore" was a fair movie, but it was just too predictable. Some
parts were quite funny, I'll have to admit it, but not enough to make up for
the overall simpleton attitude. </P>
<P>[Note: What really annoyed me the most was the blatant plugs throughout this
film. Never have I seen a movie that was so blatant in these plugs as this
one was. Example: shots opening on Pepsi and Subway billboards, Happy's
constant snacking at Subway, Happy even does a Subway commercial!]</P>
