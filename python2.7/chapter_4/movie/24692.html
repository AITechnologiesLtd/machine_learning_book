<PRE>A Review by Akiva Gottlieb</PRE>
<P>Summer is beginning earlier than ever, with each
year's first blockbuster action picture being released
in early May. Last year, early May brought us `The
Mummy', easily the worst film to hit screens in 1999.
The summer of 2000, however, seems to be a more
ambitious one, with its May blockbuster being Ridley
Scott's thrilling `Gladiator', a solid, high-octane
period picture that wears the guise of a sweeping,
emotionally-charged epic.</P>
<P>The success of `Gladiator' (both critically and
commercially) should be attributed to two film
veterans. The first is director Ridley Scott; a man
who, in the early 80's, changed the face of
science-fiction forever with `Blade Runner' and
`Alien', and showed a knack for female-exploitation
with his estrogen-fueled `Thelma and Louise' and `G.I.
Jane'. </P>
<P>The second reason for the event-movie status of
`Gladiator' is Australian heartbreaker Russell Crowe,
who was recently robbed of an Oscar for his riveting
work in Michael Mann's `The Insider'. After years of
stunning bit roles in American films like `L.A.
Confidential', he may finally become a recognized star
with his compelling performance in `Gladiator'.</P>
<P>The film begins with a battle sequence so sharply
edited that it rivals the football matches in Oliver
Stone's `Any Given Sunday'. The Roman army, led by
General Maximus (Russell Crowe), engages in bloody
combat with an incompetent squad of Germanians, and
comes out victorious. The battle brings to an end
another tireless war, and the dying king Marcus
Aurelius (Richard Harris) feels that it is time to
pass his crown on to another man.</P>
<P>The expected choice would be Aurelius' son, the
brutally unscrupulous Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). But
Aurelius has a different agenda, and tells General
Maximus in closed quarters that it is he who he wants
as heir. When not on the battlefield, Maximus is a
humble farmer with a wife and son, and claims not to
know a thing about Rome and/or politics. Aurelius
claims that his lack of political knowledge proves
only that he has not been corrupted by Roman wealth,
unlike his son.</P>
<P>When Commodus learns of his father's proposal to
Maximus, he murders his father and then orders Maximus
to be put to death. Maximus escapes his execution, and
his wife and son suffer the fate that he was planned
to receive. In the desert, a wounded Maximus is
captured and sold as a slave to a man who plans
barbaric gladiator fights in large stadiums. Because
of his former stature in the army, he is quite a
fighter, and becomes known as `The Spaniard'. He plans
to use his new `power', and some help from the radiant
Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), to help exact his revenge on
her brother, Commodus.</P>
<P>`Gladiator' is full of intense, strategic scenes of
gladiatorial battle, and beautiful, wide-angle
cinematography. It is a slick action film,
entertaining and often thrilling, but if Ridley Scott
is aspiring to a sweeping, `Braveheart'-like epic,
then his work is unsuccessful. `Gladiator's' plotline
is the generic revenge tale, somewhere along the lines
of `Hamlet' and `The Count of Monte Cristo'. </P>
<P>`Gladiator' is glorious on a technical level, but the
emotional aspects of the film are not on par. Crowe's
Maximus is a traditional hero, Phoenix's Commodus his
traditional villain, and like most action films,
`Gladiator' is traditionally predictable. Though the
film has been blamed for some historical inaccuracies,
the period detail of ancient Rome seems particularly
genuine.</P>
<P>Ridley Scott is a master of the movie blockbuster, and
his films are often revered by his legion of fans long
after their original release. Despite a number of
shortcomings, `Gladiator', a film magnificent in its
scope, should prove to be no exception. It is a
wonderful way to kick off a long summer.</P>
