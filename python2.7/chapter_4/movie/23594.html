<P> In Angela's Ashes, we got the impression that growing up a kid in
Ireland really sucks.  In The Closer You Get, we are made to believe
that Irish adulthood doesn't get much better.</P>
<P> All right… so we don't have to wait till the sequel to see Emily Watson
be cremated and we don't have to sit through two hours and twenty
minutes of a film that make a suicidal lemming seem like a happy chump,
but The Closer You Get isn't exactly a movie that sketches the Irish as
progressing far into their adulthood.  In store for Irish men in
adulthood is a simple life of multiple pints of flat Guinness combined
with a sexual desperation so great that the Irish men take out a want ad
in the Miami Herald.</P>
<P> Don't worry…  The movie is about twenty times better than its plot.</P>
<P> Despite some initial mulling over the woman at the Post Office over
whether or not to even send the advertisement, the ad does get sent
through and does end up in the Miami Herald.  In between then and the
time when the American women are to arrive (an annual dance at the end
of May), the Irish men predictably find exactly what they were looking
for all along at home.</P>
<P> So how does this manage to take up 97 minutes?  Well, it's love… Irish
style.  As in almost all Irish comedies, we see two very good traits
coupled with one very bad one.  The good traits are a predilection
towards running jokes and a tendency towards a comedy of errors.  The
bad trait is the incredibly slow pace at which small town Celtic
comedies proceed.</P>
<P> The Closer You Get is one of those movies that is funny as hell when it
tries to make a joke, but it is also one of those movies that goes along
at the speed of a Delaware driver in the Route one corridor of New
Jersey.  As a result, I found myself alternating between two states as I
watched this movie… laughing very hard and damn near asleep.</P>
<P> There are a few scenes in which The Closer You Get really borders on a
cure for insomnia.  There are more scenes in which The Closer You Get is
downright funny.  And, after seeing it, you'll never think of window
shopping the same way again.  But overall, The Closer You Get gets by as
mediocre.</P>
<P> Thus I pass the same advice to The Closer You Get as I have passed on
to other small town Celtic comedies such as The Matchmaker.  Nice try,
but you would need an intern for a humidor just yet.</P>
<PRE>3 stars</PRE>
