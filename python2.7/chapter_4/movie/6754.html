<PRE>                               IN LOVE AND WAR
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     Can a film be saved by its music?  This is the question that I was
pondering during the press screening for the plodding adaptation of the
non-fiction book "Hemingway in Love and War: The Lost Diary of Agnes
Von Kurowsky."  Directed by the great Richard Attenborough (GANDHI, CRY
FREEDOM and SHADOWLANDS), the film is called IN LOVE AND WAR and stars
heartthrobs Sandra Bullock as nurse Agnes von Kurowsky and Chris
O'Donnell as Ernest Hemingway, who was one of her wartime lovers.</P>
<P>     The music by four-time Academy Award nominee George Fenton (THE
FISHER KING, DANGEROUS LIAISONS, CRY FREEDOM, and GANDHI) is on a grand
scale.  Outdoor scenes have majestic sounds full of horns and worthy of
a vast symphony.  In interior scenes we are treated to intimate violin
serenades.  Every scene is filled with intense musical emotion.  Ah,
but then there are those actors.  Maybe they should have heard the
score during the shooting.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the most charitable thing that can be said of the two
leads is that they were miscast.  Certainly the performances they
deliver are so insubstantial that they almost vanish upon closer
examination.  The love story between them is convincing in spurts, but,
for the most part, the chemistry does not work.  Even less effective,
and never believable is Agnes's romance with the Italian Doctor
Domenico Caracciolo (Emilio Bonucci).</P>
<P>     The story is set in Italy in 1918.  The American Red Cross has
come to help with the Italian wounded as Italy is overrun by the
Austrian army.  Since Hemingway is too young and has a bad eye, he is
rejected by our military.  He signs on to help the Red Cross and, of
course, asks for duty near the front and for a rifle.  He gets the
former but not the latter.  Within hours he is wounded, and he spends
most of the movie convalescing in the hospital.  It is there that he
meets Agnes.  Much is made of their age difference, he being 19 and she
being all of 26, but they look about the same age in the movie so that
is one of many aspects of the picture that were never believable.  The
show talks a lot about age differences, but the actions ignore them.</P>
<P>     "You know what I've been told?"  remarks Agnes in one of the first
scenes.  "Italian men respect their wives.  They spoil their
mistresses.  But the only women they love are their mothers."  This is
a prelude to the time when the "old" Italian doctor will make a play
for her.  "It won't work," Hemingway argues.  "Take a look.  He's
ancient.  He must be close to 40."</P>
<P>     The cinematography by Roger Pratt is handsome and warm, but the
picture is content to be little more than pleasant.  It is never
involving.  Since I did not care about the characters, I resented some
of the manipulative parts of the story.  For example, as they play
poker in the hospital, the sickest of them, Jimmy McBride (Ian Kelly),
gets a bad hand, but taking no cards declares, "I always play the hand
I'm dealt."  Agnes and Ernest then rig it so that Jimmy wins.</P>
<P>     The love story between Agnes and Ernest is more hinted at than
shown.  The two best scenes in the movie are when she slaps him and
when he fondles her ankle because these are some of the few occasions
when the actors come out of their shells.  I like love affairs that are
believable and not ethereal.  They do not have to be at all explicit to
be great, see, for example, THE AGE OF INNOCENCE, but they must have
enough emotional involvement to be convincing.</P>
<P>     The script is by Allan Scott, Clancy Sigal, Hamilton Phelan, and
Henry S. Villard and is based on the story by Allan Scott and Dimitri
Villard, which in turn is based on the book by Henry S. Villard and
James Nagel.  Any time you get this many people involved it is a recipe
for disaster.  Perhaps this is the reason the story skims the surface
and never invites you to go deeper.  Next to the miscasting of the
leads, the script is the second biggest problem with the film.</P>
<P>     Then there are the endings.  There are at least four natural
ending points, in each of which the story would then pick back us and
show what happens next in their lives.  For a while I thought the film
was never going to end and that it was a special test version to see
how long a dozen film critics would sit there in a dark room watching
ending after ending before they gave up and left.  We all stayed
through the four, but a couple more and I might have been tempted to
leave.</P>
<P>     At least toward the end, we do have a cheery note.  Ernest's
friend Henry Villard (MacKenzie Astin) tells us that, "Older people
start aging backwards at some point."  I'll keep an eye on my watch
waiting for that blessed event.</P>
<P>     "I love you," says Agnes to Ernest.  "I'll love you as long as I
live."  I wanted and expected to feel that way about this film, but I
could not.  To answer the question I asked in the beginning, perhaps
some films can be saved by the music, but not this one.</P>
<P>     IN LOVE AND WAR runs 1:55.  It is rated PG-13 for war wounds and
for sexual situations, but no sex or nudity.  I do not remember any
profanity, but there probably was a little.  The film would be fine for
kids say ten and up.  It is a close call, but I find the film too
mediocre to recommend.  I give it **.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
