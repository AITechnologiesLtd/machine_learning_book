<P>Susan Granger's review of "JOY RIDE" (20th Century-Fox)</P>
<P>    Unseen terror is always more frightening than the obvious - and
that's what makes John Dahl's newest thriller so scary.  College is over for the
summer when Lewis (Paul Walker), a Berkeley freshman, buys a beat-up '71
Chrysler Newport so that he can pick up a high-school pal, Venna (Leelee
Sobieski) at her dorm in Denver, hoping their platonic relationship will evolve
into something more as they drive home to New Jersey. En route, he makes a
detour to Salt Lake City to bail his notoriously irresponsible brother Fuller
(Steve Zahn) out of jail. When Fuller buys a used CB-radio for fun on the road,
they decide to play a prank. Using the handle "Candy Cane" - with Lewis
pretending to be an amorous woman on the prowl - they lure an amorous
trucker,"Rusty Nail," to a roadside motel at midnight. "Bring pink champagne,"
Candy Cane purrs. "It's my favorite." But when Rusty Nail turns out to be a
psycho-killer, the situation is far from humorous. Nevertheless, they pick up
Venna who cheerily chirps, "You guys ready for an adventure?" She knows nothing
about what happened - until they discover that Rusty's big black rig is
relentlessly stalking them down the highway. After "Red Rock West" and "The Last
Seduction," John Dahl proved himself a master of film noir imagery, like glaring
headlights on a deserted highway and flickering neon. Working from Clay Tarver
and J.J. Abrams clever if less-than-credible script, he utilizes them and more,
throwing in a chase through a dark Nebraska cornfield that evokes Hitchcock's
"North by Northwest" and Spielberg's "Duel" about a faceless trucker who
terrorizes a driver. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Joy Ride" is a
tense, twisting, sinister 7. It's a popcorn picture that's guaranteed to keep
you on the edge of your seat.</P>
