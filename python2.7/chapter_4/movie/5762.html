<PRE>                               TRAINSPOTTING
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A vivid look at Edinburgh's community
          of heroin addicts.  The film is a LOST WEEKEND for
          the 90s with a little bit of crime film mixed in.
          This is a decent little indecent film, perhaps
          neither as hip nor as funny as it was intended to
          be.  It cannot live up to its current hype.
          Rating: +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     It has all been done before.  This is a superficially non-
judgmental look at four friends who are heroin addicts.  A fifth
friend, Begbie (Robert Carlyle) is clean--at least of heroin--but is
just on the near side of psychopathic.  However, you have only to step
back half an inch to see that this really is a morality tale about just
how bad life can be when heroin becomes your closest friend.  Much of
this film is strongly reminiscent of THE LOST WEEKEND.  Recently we saw
much the same approach in BASKETBALL DIARIES.  In TRAINSPOTTING the
addicts' lives are seen through the eyes of Mark Renton (Ewan
McGregor), marginally the least hooked of the group of addicts.  Also
in his group are the rather sodden Spud (Ewen Bremner), a Bond film
enthusiast trying to be suave, Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), and the
retiring Tommy (Kevin McKidd).</P>
<P>     For the first three quarters of the film there really is not much
plot.  The viewer does get a grand tour of places the viewer does not
want to be.  This includes a side tour outside and inside "the worst
toilet in Scotland," dunking for drugs.  This particular treat is a
sterling example of the kind of in-your-face (sometimes nearly
literally) humor that packs this film.  Some really is funny, but much
is more a successful attempt to churn the viewer's stomach.  It is
humor that is more depressing than funny.  As the film opens Mark, an
Edinburgh junkie maybe in his early 20s, has determined to get off
drugs.  From there basically all that really happens is that he gets
off, he gets back on, he gets in trouble with the law and he gets off
again.  At some point Mark decides that he wants to get away from drugs
and junkies, only to be pulled back as surely as Al Pacino is in the
"Godfather" films.  Along the line he gets himself the first serious
girlfriend he has had time for in a while.  Toward the end of the film
a little more does happen, but not a lot.  Plot is not TRAINSPOTTING's
strong suit.  Texture and background is really what it is all about.
It takes the viewer inside the life of a junkie and that it does very
well--perhaps just a spot too well.  These are people you do not want
to invite into your home and the film gives good reasons why not.  But
much of the wacky behavior and even some of the dating jokes have
little to do with the main premise of the film unless to show that in
some ways the main characters are not a whole lot different than they
would be off of drugs.  The humor is never quite as wild or as hip as
intended.  These are people who are disaffected from being Scots--as
they describe it, the colony of a bunch of wankers--and find escape in
hypodermic needles.</P>
<P>     American viewers may have a problem making out some (perhaps much)
of the dialogue.  TRAINSPOTTING uses Scottish slang and the dialogue is
spoken with a heavy Scottish accent.  Generally I was able to make out
about 80% of what was said.  My average was a little less with the
character Spud, but toward the end of the film it become clear that
even people in the film are not always sure what Spud is saying.
Irvine Welsh's novel TRAINSPOTTING--the title is a hobby that never
actually gets mentioned in the film--was a bestseller in Europe and the
American publishers had to push up the date of its publication here.
It seems they had planned an edition to coincide with the release of
the film, but so many copies of were being brought in from Europe that
the publication had to be moved forward to compete.  The book was
adapted to the screen--leaving a bit too much out some say--by John
Hodge.  Danny Boyle directed and Andrew Macdonald produced, as they did
for the film SHALLOW GRAVE.</P>
<P>     TRAINSPOTTING has its creative moments and sometimes it can be
funny, but the viewer should be prepared for a downbeat experience and
should expect to find himself some places he would never go of his own
accord.  As with the film CRUMB, there is a happy ending in which
viewer escapes the theater and the people with whom he has just spent
an hour or so of his life.  I expected a film more original than this
one was, but I give it a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
