<P>The test goes a little something like this-
   Go up to a female friend, wife, sister, etc. and say (if you are
female pretend I'm saying this to you):  "I was watching a movie on
cable last night...Man, that Sharon Stone is so hot! Don't you think
so?"...then turn your head and brace for your test subject's
reply. The most polite response she's likely to give is a grimace while
audibly rolling her eyes. I'd wager that most of you (feamle)
bristled from just reading the test statement.
    One might hastily conclude from this test that all women are catty
and incapable of paying each other a compliment. You would be
incorrect. If you were to repeat the test statement and in place of
"Sharon Stone" use "Julianna Margulies" or "Emma Thompson"
you'll find you get an almost opposite reaction. You may even be
applauded and perceived as a higher thinker.
   It's not that women don't compliment other women...just certain
women.  Julianna and Emma happen to fall on the ‘sanctioned'
A-list. These are women who present themselves as smart, heroic, demure
and...well, nonthreatening. Sure, Sharon Stone (as well as
Demi Moore) has made great strides in getting higher salaries for women
in Hollywood and she was lauded by critics for her
performances in CASINO and LAST DANCE...still, there's that threatening/
nonthreatening thing. See, a common thread of the A-list
women is that while men may find most of them attractive none of them
are really considered to be "HOT".</P>

<P>    This has been a sneak preview of my next career venture. Along with
being a multimedia artist and movie critic I'm going to tour
the country on the seminar circuit. Following in the footsteps of Dr.
John Gray I'm going to further polarize the sexes by pontificating
on the differences between men and woman, however, my focus will be a
little different.
    From talking to alot of women I've come to realize that they can't
or don't see the reality of what men, ALL MEN,  truly are. This
"dampening" effect, I believe, is biological and no different than the
function that erases the memory of the pain of childbirth. My
teachings are not aimed at demonizing male behavior but pointing out
that it's perceived crudeness is the result of biological
hardwiring, which is centered around sex and killing stuff. It is a
constant struggle between instinct and the prime directive: The
continuation of a society and propagation of the species.
    Of course, I'll also cover "Why your man couldn't care less about
meeting your friends" and other long kept secrets- but for that
and the rest you'll have to come hear me speak in the Ranchero room of
your local Marriott or Red Lion and buy a $99 set of tapes.
    Well, anyway, I got to thinking about all of this while watching the
reaction of MULAN when  she enters the Chinese army training
camp and discovers the true behavior of men when comfortably immersed in
their natural element.</P>
<P>    Since the marketing blitz has only been half that of HERCULES, you
may not know that MULAN is the newest animated featured
offered by Disney. It is the story of a young woman, Mulan (Ming Na
Wen), who is too much of a tomboy and free spirit to marry
off, thus bringing honor to her long-suffering family. When the Huns
invade China the emperor calls for a male from every household
to join the army. To spare her crippled father Mulan steals his armor,
disguises herself as a man and joins the Chinese army- knowing
that if she is found out she will be executed.</P>
<P>    By now we're all familiar with the clocksetting  formula Disney uses
for it's movies so I think I can anticipate most of your
questions.  Let me start out by saying that nothing in MULAN is
extraordinary or even amazing, but there is alot that's very good.
    One of the best things about MULAN is how understated it is. While
HERCULES was as boisterous and boastful as Herakles
himself, MULAN is much quieter and asks you to expect no more than it's
willing to deliver. Have you noticed the absence of Happy
Meal toys and the lack of commercials for it? The tone of MULAN is
softer right down to its watercolor-like palette. The art is
reminiscent of Chinese prints without being daring enough to let you
forget that it's a Disney cartoon.
    Another thing in its favor is that unlike HERCULES, HUNCHBACK OF
NOTRE DAME, POCAHONTAS, or even ALADDIN it is an
original story with no literary or historical base to "piss" all over.</P>
<P>    If there's anything in MULAN that comes close to being amazing it's
how well they handled the characters. Especially the
supporting and background characters which are the best since ALADDIN.
They are all distinctive and ,except for Yao (who is
basically REN & STIMPY's George Liquor with a beard) very Chinese
without being racially insulting- In other words, no Jerry Lewis
clones here.
    The obligatory ,annoying, comic-relief characters are kept to a
minimum. Namely, Mushu the
Dragon, as voiced by Eddie Murphy. Murphy does an excellent job and
Mushu is a pretty good character, but he's on the set of the
wrong movie. Even though the anachronistic humor has a much lower
profile than in most Disney movies, MULAN is so deep in
ancient Chinese culture that it wasn't until halfway through the picture
that I got used to Mushu.</P>
<P>    The character I was probably most impressed with was the General's
son, Li-Shang. Whereas Hercules was about as Greek as a
McGyro, Li-Shang is the most ethnic looking stud/ love interest Disney
has ever done. It was good to see a character that was
handsome, proud, and every bit Chinese...except for his singing voice.
   Li-Shang is voiced by B.D.Wong, until a very important scene when he
opens his mouth to sing and the most Anglo voice
imaginable comes out of it.  The voice belongs to Donnie Osmond- and I'm
not speaking metaphorically, it really is DONNIE "whiter
than an albino mime" OSMOND!  It's very jarring and doesn't help that
the song is not all that good either.
       Well, you knew you couldn't escape one of these without suffering
through a few psuedo- show tunes. Replacing the usual
composer "Broadway" Tim Rice is "one-hit-wonder" Matthew Wilder. If that
name sounds familiar to you turn on your radio to
K-LITE and you're likely to hear him belting out: "Ain't nuthin' gonna
break-a my stride...".  The songs in MULAN leave you
wondering, not "where did he disappear to?" but "who thought it was a
good idea to find him?".  On the positive side,  MULAN has the
fewest songs of any of the others (maybe 4) and the score is nice.</P>
<P>     As for the story, it's very simple and predictable, yet enjoyment.
Though it centers around the gender conflicts and honor, it is
mostly a story of empowerment. A must-see for little girls and a
should-see for little boys. I couldn't help but make comparisons to
G.I. JANE. Unfortunately, it also borrowed the one thing from G.I. JANE
that I didn't like.
    As both movies seem to be settling into very low key but poignant
endings, they tack on a poorly-conceived action sequence. It's as
if the investors had a meeting and decided that their targeted audience
wouldn't be happy without it. In the case of MULAN it may
have also been a matter of trying to stretch out the time. Oh well, it
is a kid's movie.
    And YES, it IS a kid's movie! For all of you parents who felt burned
by THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, you can go back
into the water.  I assure you that MULAN is safe. About the most
uncomfortable question you'll have to answer is, "Do the Chinese
really such a low threshold for embarrassment?"</P>
<PRE><HR></PRE>
<P>BTW- There is a male counterpart to that test question
 Casually say to your brother, friend, male co-worker, etc.: "I think
George Michael is sooo hot! I can't believe people think he's gay."</P>
<PRE>Then cover your ears.</PRE>
