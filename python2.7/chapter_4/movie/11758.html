<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>It must have been nice to live around 1920, when one could stumble into
a bank and belligerently order the clerks to hand over all the money,
and then stumble back out on to the street and mosey back to the horse,
and then get away, having "not been seen."  The Newton brothers were
smarter than this, but their tactics are frequently as conspicuous. 
Apparently it didn't matter, because they are the most successful bank
robbers in American history.  </P>
<P>And their story makes a darn good movie.  The Newton Boys is a pleasant
surprise:  I expected something far less than this entertaining,
well-acted, and thoughtful film.  </P>
<P>Matthew McConaughey has the largest role as Willis Newton, the brother
who engineers most of the bank robberies.  At first, his accomplices are
his two younger brothers, Joe (Skeet Ulrich) and Jess (Ethan Hawke), and
Brentwood Glasscock (Dwight Yokam), the bomb expert.  Later, their
brother Dock (Vincent D'Onofrio) gets out of jail and catches up with
them.</P>
<P>Willis masterminds each robbery, and is responsible for upping the
stakes as time goes on.  They start off small, blowing up  safes in the
middle of the night and taking the money.  Soon, they move up to
breaking into two banks simultaneously.  Not long after this, they are
going to the bigger cities and taking a lot more money.  Willis
justifies his actions by saying, "It's just one thief stealing from
another," and the good thing is we believe him (at least a little bit). </P>
<P>Bank robbery is a serious thing, but I liked the light tone that
director Richard Linklater has taken with this film.  The bank robberies
are simultaneously suspenseful and funny; they are also well-filmed, and
enhanced by an appropriate musical score.  The sets are authentic, and
certainly not inexpensive:  huge blocks of city streets from this time
period have been constructed for the film, and the result is a picture
that is visually flawless.</P>
<P>But what makes this such an enjoyable film are the characters, and the
actors who portray them.  McConaughey adds one more bit of proof that he
can hold his own as a leading man; he manages to make Willis the crazed,
eccentric man that he is, while still demanding our like and sympathy. 
And later, when he meets his love, Louise Brown (Julianna Margulies), we
truly believe that he cares for her.  Surprisingly, this is one of the
best-written romances I've seen in a while, for the female character is
fleshed-out, and Margulies plays her part well.</P>
<P>The rest of the cast is made up of a group of talented young actors who
are all making names for themselves.  Hawke, who plays the most jovial
(and most volatile) of the brothers, is perhaps the most entertaining to
watch.  Ulrich is quiet and reserved as Joe, and he does a good job
adding dimension to his character.  D'Onofrio, who has been playing
small parts for a while, is good here, though not given a lot of screen
time.  </P>
<P>Don't leave when the credits begin:  interviews with the real Willis
and Joe Newton role through the credits.  After seeing the film, it's
vastly entertaining to watch these old men talk about what they did so
many years ago (and Willis is still justifying the robberies).  And it
also serves to show how well McConaughey and Ulrich play their roles.</P>
<P>The Newton Boys is a charming, entertaining film.  Its success lies in
its simplicity, and I don't understand why all film makers can't go by
this easy set of guidelines:  make the characters round and interesting,
use talented actors, treat the material with respect, and everything
else will usually fall into place.  </P>
