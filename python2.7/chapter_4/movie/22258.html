<PRE>_Diamonds_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>A grandfather, his son, and grandson take a road trip from Canada to
Reno, Nevada in search of some lost diamonds, along the way taking an
extended side trip at a brothel.  It sounds like a junky comedy ripe for
release in the January/February dumping ground, and John Asher's film
would have received that undistinguished--and, to a certain extent,
deserved--treatment if not for one person: Kirk Douglas, who headlines as
the cantankerous former championship boxer searching for riches and
renewed happiness in his twilight years.</P>
<P>His touching, effortless performance--his first screen role since
suffering a stroke--is the reason why Miramax is giving the film a
one-week awards qualifying engagement, and indeed it is great to see the
former Spartacus back where he belongs; his acting skills are in tip-top
shape even if his body isn't.  Yet I wouldn't call his performance
particularly award-worthy other than for sentimental reasons, which is
more than I can say for this rather silly and sappy film, which also
stars Dan Aykroyd as Douglas' son, who only wants his daddy's love and
approval; and Corbin Allred as Aykroyd's rebellious son, perhaps the
whitest of white boys to ever utter such terms such as "yo" and "phat." 
The normally overwrought Jenny McCarthy, late of MTV's _Singled_Out_ and
_Playboy_ magazine, is nicely held in check as a prostitute (insert your
own joke here); and as her madam, Lauren Bacall strikes luminous sparks
with Douglas, with whom she had previously teamed nearly 50 years ago on
_Young_Man_with_a_Horn_.  However, not even the reunion of these two
screen legends makes the film evaporate from the memory any less quickly.
