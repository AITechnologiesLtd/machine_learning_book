BLESSED ART THOU
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Writer/director Timothy J. Disney's BLESSED ART THOU, set in an old
California monastery that produces fine wines, relates the story of a
miracle.  (To describe the exact nature of the event would diminish your
enjoyment of the picture, so I will not elaborate further on it.  But be
careful because I suspect many other reviewers will feel it necessary to
tell you more than you strictly need to know and will spoil the movie
for you.)</P>
<P>The film is a drama that only begins to introduce substantial comedic
elements once it has set a reverential tone.  My audience was full of
uneasy laughter as it seemed that many viewers didn't quite know what
behavior was expected of them -- rather like not being sure when it is
acceptable to laugh in church.</P>
<P>In the film's opening sequence, a monk, Brother Francis (Paul
Guilfoyle), is making his confession.  "I have failed to love," he tells
his confessor.  Guilfoyle and a host of other known supporting actors
worked for scale on the production according to the director, who was at
our screening.</P>
<P>The monastery is racked with controversy with some believing that a
miracle has occurred and others remaining skeptical even in the face of
dramatic evidence.  The problem with the movie is that, although it
isn't a one-joke movie, it is essentially a one-idea one.  As a short
film, it would have made an intriguing half-hour story.  But as a
full-length motion picture, it quickly runs out of ideas, forcing it to
fall back on clichéd conflicts.</P>
<P>"They are all running in circles about scandal, reputation and
theology," Brother Anselm says.  Indeed they are.  I wished the film had
been able to make me care more about the conflict, but it left me
finding it all to be little more than a cute stunt.  I will give them
this.  Within the confines of the thin storyline, the actors did their
best.  But sometimes even your best isn't quite enough to save the day.</P>
<P>BLESSED ART THOU runs 1:30.  It is not yet rated but would probably be
PG-13 for brief nudity.  The film would probably not interest those
under 13.</P>
