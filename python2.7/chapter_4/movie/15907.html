<P>There are many ways to create an anti war film. Some dwell on the violence.
Some dwell on my cause, or your cause, and justify it. And some, stand as
truly great works that do not try to prove anything except that we are
fickle human beings convinced that we are right at every turn.</P>
<P>Nagisa Oshima, went a step further. He went so far as to state that much of
this stuff is a battle of inner wills, if not an egotistical  desire which
man has for physical control, even sexual.  The point is made that even at
the worst of times, the animal in us will still come out, be it in fighting,
or in anything else.</P>
<P>The place is Java, in 1942.  And the Japanese maintain a prisoner camp for a
few soldiers.  Most of them seem to have been commanders rather than just
common field soldiers.  The presumption is that these camps were set up to
try and gain valuable information that might lead the Japanese into places
where they could attack the enemy.  It might have worked in many cases, but
in this particular story it doesn't.  Be it a staunch English major, or the
better meaning and mannered John Lawrence, who had been in Japan prior to
the war.</P>
<P>In between the battles of wills, the commanders engage in various incidents
with their prisoners, and they never seem to get the  edge they want.  This
forces the commander Yonoi and sergeant Hara to have a better respect for
their prisoners, but it never seems to change into anything else.</P>
<P>There are moments in this film that are very well written, and have been
specially well directed into film, perhaps because it is the famous writer
that directed the film.  And the continuity of the piece is rather
interesting, with flashbacks that are immediately seen as unusual, but an
indication that the characters are here to take a stand, and one of power
and inner force at that. The young English soldier whose background seems
centered in various forms of betrayal ( so he calls it ) regarding his
younger brother, ends up clearing up why he joined the army in the first
place. And he finally commits the ultimate insult that gets him buried, as
we finally see why it is that he did what he did.  For once he has not
betrayed anybody, but by his actions helped save, or buy time, for his
fellow prisoners.</P>
<P>Eventually the tables turn and the Japanese commander is visited by  Mr.
Lawrence, who understands the spoils of war better than anyone. "We are
victims of men who feel they are right, and the truth really is that no one
is right, of course". The commander is to be executed the next morning.</P>
<P>Very good in this film are both Tom Conti and David Bowie, in what is an
excellent script, very well directed and thought about.  The film defines
color only in certain times and moments.  And lush it is. The rest of the
time it is basically bland, and only shows the two colors of the camp.</P>
<P>With music by Ryuchi Sakamoto, who also plays the Commander Yanoi, this film
pulsates with a few musical tones, that just bloom into a musical moment.  A
rare, and well designed style for the film.</P>
