<PRE>MYSTERY MEN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>As superheroes, it's hard enough fighting vicious villains without
having the local cops ridicule you as being merely a group of wannabes.
And with Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear) garnering all of the television
coverage and concomitant product endorsements, it's almost enough to
make you want to hang up your kitschy costume and return to a normal
lifestyle.</P>
<P>Kinka Usher's hyperactive spoof of comic book action heroes, MYSTERY
MEN, is never less than cute.  Its shortcoming is that Neil Cuthbert's
superficial script never goes beyond cute.  You can count the big laughs
on a single hand, but the movie never fails to provide good
entertainment.  And even if it never wows you, at least the risk taking
and imaginative story with its good-spirited hijinks will never
disappoint you either.  Think of it as BATMAN with a heart.  The
production design and art direction by BLADE's Kirk M. Petruccelli and
Barry Chusid are reminiscent of the look of the Tim Burton BATMANs.</P>
<P>Captain Amazing, who has just lost his Pepsi endorsement but not his
power, has a predicament.  Thanks to his effectiveness, there just
aren't enough evil challengers left in Champion City.  Forced to lower
himself to fighting minor bad guys at a nursing home, he needs a better
class of opponents.  Otherwise, more of his sponsors, whose logos he
wears on his black jumpsuit, will drop him like they would a soap opera
with falling market share.</P>
<P>Captain Amazing turns to his old nemesis, Casanova Frankenstein
(Geoffrey Rush), to save the day.  Although Frankenstein is currently
imprisoned in a mental institution for his dastardly deeds, this proves
little impediment to Captain Amazing's plan for battle.</P>
<P>While the titans are contesting the high ground, the story's ragtag band
of wannabes are winning the hearts of the audience, if not the citizens
of Champion City, as their track record does not inspire confidence.</P>
<P>The founders of this unnamed band, later to be referred to as the
Mystery Men, are some very unlikely heroes.  The original members of the
group include: the Blue Raja (Hank Azaria), the master of cutlery --
throwing forks and spoons but eschewing knives; the Shoveler (William H.
Macy), who wears a yellow miner's hat and swings a mean shovel; and Mr.
Furious (Ben Stiller), an angry, biker guy who drives a
"Harley-compatible motorcycle."  (For the record, I drive a
Rolls-Royce-compatible automobile.)</P>
<P>"We're the other guys," the sincerely serious and sweetly shy Shoveler
explains, "We're the guys nobody bets on."  When the need arises, he's
willing to rise to any challenge, even though his wife keeps threatening
to divorce him because of all of his silly superhero stuff.  "We've got
a blind date with destiny, and it looks like she's ordered the lobster,"
he says to arouse his fellow wannabes to battle.  The movie has the good
sense to never take itself seriously, making the most ridiculous lines
the best.</P>
<P>Some even weirder recruits join them.  Kel Mitchell plays a
comic-worshiping kid known as Invisible Boy.  His claim to fame is that
he can make himself invisible.  There is only this one small catch.
While he's invisible, he can see himself, but if anyone else looks, he
becomes visible again.  The creative story manages to find a use for
this highly limited talent.</P>
<P>The Spleen (Paul Reubens) produces noxious gas as his weapon, which
attracts an amorous skunk.  It's a good sign when a movie is able to
find something a little different to do with the overworked flatulence
jokes.</P>
<P>Wes Studi plays their new leader, The Sphinx, who trains them in
everything from group hugs to sewing.  Most of all, he provides them
with words of wisdom to speak to their inner superhero child.  ("You
must be like the wolf pack and not the six-pack."  "He who quits
training, only trains himself to quit.")  All of this cliched wisdom
drives the word-challenged Mr. Furious into his signature fits of anger.
"I don't need a compass to tell me which way the sun shines," he tells
the Sphinx.</P>
<P>As perhaps the funniest of the lot, Janeane Garofalo plays the Bowler.
She is interviewed last on a day when the guys talk to a host of
superhero pretenders (the Waffleman, the Pencilhead, the Squeegeeman,
the Ballerinaman and the PMS Avenger among others).  Stiller doesn't do
much with his part, except in his scenes with Garofalo.  Together, their
snappy, sarcastic chemistry steals the scenes.</P>
<P>There's a plot, but it doesn't really matter.  The movie just jumps from
one nice visual to another.  Every once and awhile, the scenes are funny
enough to produce outright laughter.  The now moribund BATMAN series
could use some doses of MYSTERY MEN's self-mocking humor.  There isn't
much to MYSTERY MEN, but what there is will keep a smile on your face.</P>
<P>MYSTERY MEN runs 1:52.  It is rated PG-13 for comic action violence and
crude humor and would be fine for kids 8 and up.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 10, liked it and gave it ** 1/2.  He thought it was
an imaginative film with a lot of action.</P>
