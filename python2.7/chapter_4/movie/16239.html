<PRE>The Thin Red Line (1998, R) ** out of  *****</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Terrence Malick</PRE>
<PRE>Reviewed by: Mike Summers</PRE>
<P>Terrence Malick made an excellent 90 minute film adaptation of James Jones' 
World War II novel. Unfortunately, he buried it within an overlong and 
overreaching 3-hour long pseudo-epic. This is a shame because the film 
features an outstanding performance by Nick Nolte. The best scene is when Nick 
Nolte's character, Lt. Col. Tall, is forced to deal with the direct refusal by 
Capt. Staros (Elias Koteas) to execute an order.  Nolte's reaction and 
transformation may be the best work of his career. Had Terrence Malick 
concentrated on the great performances of Nolte and Koteas as well as those by 
Sean Penn, Woody Harrelson, and John Cusack, he could have made a truly great 
film. Instead, Malick saddled the film with plodding pacing, unnecessary 
flashbacks, and a voice-over narration all designed to telegraph the great 
philosophical underpinnings of the story. The narration was especially 
annoying as much of it sounded like very bad high school poetry.  With a lot 
of editing, the core story could be transformed into a truly classic war film. 
Hopefully, the DVD version of this film will feature options to suppress the 
narration, and perhaps will even provide for an alternate, shorter version of 
the film. I give this film two stars out of five.</P>
