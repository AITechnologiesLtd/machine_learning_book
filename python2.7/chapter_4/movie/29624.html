<P>Zoolander (2001) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Will
Ferrell, Christine Taylor, Milla Jovovich, Jerry Stiller and Jon Voight. Story
by Drake Sather and Ben Stiller. Screenplay by Drake Sather & Ben Stiller and
John Hamburg. Directed by Ben Stiller. Approx. 100 minutes. Rated PG-13. 
 Zoolander is stupid fun - emphasis on stupid - with only a couple of missteps
that mar its overall enjoyment. </P>
<P> The movie, co-produced, co-written, directed by and starring Ben Stiller, is
nothing more than a satirical jab at the fashion industry and the perception of
male models as dim-witted, self-obsessed dolts who are pliable and easily
manipulated. It almost seems like a redundancy. </P>
<P> It doesn't sound like much, and nor does it seem like it takes much effort to
skewer male models. After all, Fabio does it all the time just by being himself.</P>
<P> Zoolander's plot, unfortunately, is in bad taste, considering today's political
climate. It revolves around a cartel of designers wanting the new prime minister
of Malaysia assassinated because he is vowing to raise the wages of his
countrymen who slave in the sweatshops run by said same designers. </P>
<P> It would have been less objectionable if a real nation had not been used and
the assassination plot had been altered to perhaps merely overthrowing the
leader. </P>
<P> The second misstep revolves around a sequence featuring three of Zoolander's
male model friends who it seems are so dumb that at a gas station they spray
each other with gasoline from the pumps. One is stupid enough to try lighting a
cigarette, thus blowing them all to smithereens. Recent events speak for
themselves as to why this scene should have been deleted. </P>
<P> And, yes, in fairness, people at the preview screening howled, thinking it was
hilarious. But there may be some in the audience - myself included - whose
sensitivities may preclude them from seeing the humor in such a situation. </P>
<P> But we cannot toss out the entire barrel because a couple of the apples are
rotten. </P>
<P> In truth, Zoolander is pure silliness, a no-brainer, just-sit-back-and-laugh
feature. </P>
<P> The plot is simple. Since male models are easy to control one must be
brainwashed - or in this case given a light rinse - to carry out the diabolical
plot. And who is the most vacuous model around, why three-time model of the
year, Derek Zoolander  master of the "blue-steel" look. </P>
<P> Stiller captures the walk and talk - as well as the look - of the male model.
He snaps his head, raises an eyebrow, furrows his brow in incomprehension with
comical ease. </P>
<P> His Zoolander is a man-child, as dense as an Adirondack forest. When his
reporter girlfriend, Matilda (woodenly played by Stiller's wife, Christine
Taylor) tells Zoolander and his main rival, Hansel (Owen Wilson), that she was
once bulimic, Zoolander looks at her in awe and says, "You can read minds?" </P>
<P> That's about the level of the movie's humor. </P>
<P> A "walk-off" between Zoolander and Hansel, judged by David Bowie, is one of the
film's more inventive sequences, as is a scene in which former X-Files star
David Duchovny shows up as a conspiracy theorist who explains to Zoolander and
Matilda how all the political assassinations of the past 200 years have been
carried out by male models. </P>
<P> Wilson walks away with the film as the laid-back Hansel, who shifts from
Zoolander's main rival to ally in his attempt to halt the assassination plot.
With his long blonde locks and outlandish outfits, he makes a charming
blockhead. </P>
<P> The movie's main villain, Mugatu, is portrayed by Saturday Night Live's Will
Ferrell who has yet to find a film role that truly exploits his talents. Here,
he is reduced to merely yelling and mugging, while wearing ridiculous outfits
with a crop of white hair that looks like it was borrowed from the Three
Stooges' Larry Fine. </P>
<P> At least Stiller made the film a family affair, giving his mom, Anne Meara, the
small role of a protester, while his dad, Jerry Stiller, plays Zoolander's
agent. </P>
<P> Zoolander has its shortcomings. It is definitely not sophisticated humor, but
it does provide several laughs. And you will never be able to look at a model
again without wondering how akin he is to Derek Zoolander. </P>
