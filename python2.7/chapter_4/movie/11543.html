<PRE>THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Braveheart screenwriter Randall Wallace makes his directoral debut with
this adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' further adventures of the Three
Musketeers. While not as good as his earlier film, The Man in the Iron
Mask is entertaining.</P>
<P>The three musketeers have, at this time, retired and gone their separate
ways.  Aramis (Jeremy Irons) has returned to the priesthood, Porthos
(Gerard Depardieu) has devoted himself to earthly pleasures, and Athos
(John Malkovich) has contented himself with raising his son, Raoul
(Peter Sarsgaard).  Their protigi, D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne), remains
in the service of the King, Louis XIV (Leonardo DiCaprio).</P>
<P>King Louis is a young king, and not a very good one.  His people are
starving, his armies are fighting unjust wars, and he is more concerned
about chasing the skirts of Raoul's fiancee, Christine (Judith
Godreche). However, King Louis has a secret:  one whose very identity is
so threatening that he has been imprisoned deep within the Bastille and
forced to wear a mask of iron.</P>
<P>What's the one thing you expect out of any movie starring the Three
Musketeers? Swordplay!  But, for some reason, the movie's halfway over
before any true swashbuckling gets done.  When it finally arrives, it is
mostly chaotic, and makes you yearn for the better days of Fairbanks or
Flynn.</P>
<P>But, luckily there's more to the story than simple swordplay.  The drama
in the film is handled well, even though the themes are a bit broad.
The weakest part of Wallace's script is the dialogue, which starts out
very poorly, but, thankfully, does get better as the film progresses.</P>
<P>And the film is helped by a fine cast.  DiCaprio is in fine form here,
given more to do than he was in Titanic. The musketeers are also good,
with only Gerard Depardieu (strangely, the only true Frenchman among the
bunch) seeming out of place.  His Porthos is used primarily for comic
relief, which is mostly neither comical nor a relief.</P>
<P>There are a few moments when the film stutters, particularly in its
first hour, but as its dense plot is given a chance to unfold, the lure
of the story manages to capture its audience.  The Man in the Iron Mask
is far from being the great epic it strives to be, but it is ultimately
enjoyable, and delivers entertainment for the dollar.</P>
