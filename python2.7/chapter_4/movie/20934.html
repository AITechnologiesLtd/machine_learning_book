<P>I will admit that I was sick of seeing the trailer of this film every time
that I went out to the theatres over the past year. It was apparently pushed
back a couple of times, but here it is now, right before the real hockey
season gets under way. Anyway, it isn't every day that Hollywood comes out
with a hockey movie which isn't turned into an actual NHL franchise, so I
was still willing to give this one a shot. Good move.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A small wintery town that prides itself on its dignity and game of hockey,
soon find themselves on the receiving end of a proposal from the actual New
York Rangers. The NHL team want to challenge the small town goobers to an
exhibition game, after a flattering article about their rich tradition of
hockey fills the pages of Sports Illustrated.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
I love hockey. You don't have to like hockey to like this movie, but being
Canadian, and liking hockey, both allowed me to appreciate this film's
universal message on a deeper level. Three films which kept resonating in my
mind as I watched this small but effective film, were the underdog done good
flick, RUDY, the character driven small town tale, BEAUTIFUL GIRLS (8/10),
and the bigger budgeted FOR LOVE OF THE GAME (7.5/10). Consider this one an
amalgamation of the three. Sound like you've "been there, done that"? Maybe.
But this movie worked for me. It's about heart. It's about drive,
inspiration, pride, tradition, love of a game which anyone, including
non-hockey fans, could truly appreciate. It's also about relationships and
the hardships that people have to endure to survive a small town
micro-culture, a feeling of second banana to a sport, and opportunities
missed and achieved. I don't live in a small town, but I am always smitten
by films of these kind which successfully convey the small town feel to
someone who has never been. It's easy to see how many of these communities
are deemed to be extended families, as every little thing once does somehow
seems to affect every one else in the group. So strange.</P>
<P>Not only was this film able to convey this atmosphere convincingly with many
sharply written characters all grieving on some level or another, but even
more importantly, it was able to resonate the importance and deeply
ingrained feeling of love for a sport, which allowed us to feel for these
characters, and obviously, root for them in the big game. You should know
that this film does not feature a lot of hockey play. In fact, I would say
that it is more of a character-driven film based around a common "obsession"
which happens to be the game of hockey. There are funny moments, dramatic
moments, touching moments, and obviously moments of fun hockey. I enjoyed
all of the performances in the film, except for the Burt Reynolds character
who seemed a little too narrowly drawn for my taste, but kudos to Russell
Crowe and the rest of the gang for portraying these folks as real human
beings, instead of stick figures from the minds of Hollywood execs. There is
also a cute cameo near the end of the film (Read the little known facts if
you really want to know who it is) which seemed soooo appropriate for this
movie. Some may find this film corny and derivative, but God help me if I
didn't enjoy its every moment. Another unnamed critic hailed this film to
the "Rocky of hockey", and despite the complete banality of that statement,
I would have to agree in respect to its intent. If you're in the mood for a
feel-good, character-driven drama featuring some good performances, funny
and tender moments, then this is one that you should definitely check out.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
When you consider the fact that this actor is Canadian, has gone on the
record as saying that he loves hockey, and that he starred in director Jay
Roach's two previous directing efforts (Roach is the director of this film
and married to the singer from The Bangles, Susanna Hoffs), it shouldn't
surprise you to find out that actor Mike Myers makes a quirky and humorous
cameo near the end of this film. He plays a hockey commentator.
Actor Russell Crowe was born in New Zealand but now calls Australia home.
You might remember his wife in this film, actress Mary McCormack, from her
popular role of Alison Stern, wife of the self-acclaimed "king of all media"
Howard Stern, in the movie PRIVATE PARTS (7/10).
Shot entirely in Alberta, Canada, this film apparently led to at least one
barroom brawl when actor Russell Crowe was alleged to have gotten himself
into such an altercation during the filming months of this movie.
In case you are living on the planet Mars and still don't know who writer
David E. Kelly is, he is the man behind the two Emmy-winning shows, "Ally
McBeal" and "The Practice". He's also known for being the man who once got
Michelle Pfeiffer to agree to marry him in 1993, and has since been married
to the lovely actress, and the man who penned three other motion pictures,
TO GILLIAN ON HER 37TH BIRTHDAY, the monster tale, LAKE PLACID and FROM THE
HIP, which has apparently based on some of his own experiences as a lawyer.
Sadly, it starred actor Judd Nelson :) David actually used to be a lawyer in
Boston and attended both Princeton University and Boston University Law
School.
This film was originally titled POND RULES.</P>
