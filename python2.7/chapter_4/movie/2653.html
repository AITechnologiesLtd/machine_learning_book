<P>     "Blue, liberty; White, equality; Red, fraternity... We looked very 
closely at these three ideas, how they functioned in everyday life, but 
from an individual's point of view.  These ideals are contradictory with 
human nature.  When you deal with them practically, you do not know how 
to live with them.  Do people really want liberty, equality, fraternity?" 
        - Writer/director Krzysztof Kieslowski </P>
<P>     WHITE, the second chapter of Krzysztof Kieslowski's THREE COLORS
trilogy, is different from BLUE in more ways than the color it centers
on and the ideals represented.  Instead of the dark, somber tone
adopted by BLUE, this film aims for something lighter.  Additionally,
while WHITE possesses a sardonic quality never sought after by its
predecessor, the emotional tapestry of this picture is not the other's
equal.</P>
<P>     Although WHITE is self-contained, there is an intersection with
BLUE.  In the previous film, the stars of this one, Julie Delpy and
Zbigniew Zamachowski, make brief appearances; likewise, Juliette
Binoche sticks her head through a courtroom door near the beginning of
WHITE (blink and you may miss her).  Delpy, Zamachowski, and Binoche
all turn up at the conclusion of RED (due to be released this fall),
along with the featured performers of that movie, Jean-Louis
Trintignant and Irene Jacobs.</P>
<P>     WHITE begins in a Parisian courtroom with the arrival of a lonely,
dejected Karol Karol (Zamachowski), clutching a summons and looking
downtrodden.  Shortly thereafter, his marriage has been dissolved by
the court because of his inability to consummate the union, and his
beautiful young wife Dominique (Delpy) has claimed that she no longer
loves him.  Karol is devastated, and decides to quit Paris for his
native Poland.</P>
<P>     To make matters worse, he has no passport and no money to obtain
one, and after Dominique sets fire to a beauty shop that he and she
owned together, the police want him for arson.  Fate, however, is not
entirely working against Karol, and he finds a friend in his fellow
countryman Mikolaj (Janusz Gajos), who helps him back to Warsaw, where
he begins rebuilding his life and planning revenge against the woman he
still loves.</P>
<P>     WHITE focuses mainly on Karol's life, and that's one of its
possible flaws.  While we are presented with a well-rounded picture of
the Polish hairdresser, we see so little of his wife that the eventual
resolution falls a little flat.  The few glimpses we are afforded of
Dominique reveal an intensely interesting character who is quite simply
never given enough screen time.</P>
<P>     Another problem with WHITE is that the plot occasionally leaps
forward in a rather disjointed manner.  At times, it seems that there
are scenes missing.  While none of these gaps cause permanent damage,
they engender a momentary sense of confusion.  BLUE was seamlessly
edited; the same cannot be said about WHITE.</P>
<P>     Nevertheless, despite its flaws, WHITE is an excellent character
study, and the presentation of a twisted love story is compelling.  The
Chaplinesque Zbigniew Zamachowski delivers a performance that displays
the depth and breadth of his considerable talent.  In addition to
portraying desperation, pain, and triumph, Zamachowski gets an
opportunity to do a little light comedy.</P>
<P>     Julie Delpy, who was so impressive as Sam Shepard's tragic
girlfriend in VOYAGER (and also had roles in EUROPA, EUROPA and
Disney's THE THREE MUSKETEERS), is luminescent in limited exposure.
She's very effective, and her cold portrayal of Dominique during the
film's opening scenes does nothing to endear the character to the
audience.</P>
<P>     As was the case with BLUE, the title color permeates the film.
Kieslowski uses images of white to reinforce his theme of equality.
Poland, with its cloudy winter skies and snowscapes, is a perfect
setting, and the color shows up in dozens of other instances, including
building facades, cars, pigeons, a porcelain bust, clothing, and the
misty halo through which several scenes are filmed.  Zbigniew Preisner,
whose score was integral to BLUE, is the composer for WHITE, but in
this case, his music serves a more normal function.</P>
<P>     Kieslowski understands human nature, and his ability to breathe
life into that understanding through these characters is what sets his
films apart from those of many others.  As BLUE did for liberty, so
WHITE does for equality, giving a face to an abstract concept.  WHITE
does not have the impact of its predecessor, but neither will its story
or characters fade the moment the theater's lights go on.</P>
