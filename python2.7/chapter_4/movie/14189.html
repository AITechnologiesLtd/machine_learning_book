<PRE>The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 91</PRE>
<P>"The Hunchback of Notre Dame" is an outstanding
adaptation of the Victor Hugo novel, set in
fifteenth century France.  One of the biggest
budget films of its era, the sets are imposing,
the cast is first rate, and the script is
excellent.</P>
<P>Charles Laughton is the Hunchback, deformed
but spry and intelligent.  He is a bellringer
at the cathedral of Notre Dame.  He falls in
love with young gypsy Maureen O'Hara, who is
initially terrified of him.  Also in love with
O'Hara is energetic poet/playwright Edmund O'Brien
(in his film debut) and the Hunchback's father
figure, brooding Frollo (Cedric Hardwicke).
Other characters include the King of France
(Harry Davenport) and the King of Thieves
(Thomas Mitchell).</P>
<P>Davenport is an obscure supporting actor, but
he has decent roles in three of the best films
from the 1930s: "Gone With the Wind", "The Hunchback
of Notre Dame", and "The Life of Emile Zola".
His King Louis is gentle and open-minded,
and France would still have a King today if
they were all like him.</P>
<P>It is virtually impossible to say anything
bad about this film.  The acting (especially
O'Brien) is a bit hammy at times, and it is difficult
to believe that a gypsy woman could be the cause
of so much chaos.  But when a film is so entertaining
and spectacular, all is forgiven.  There are many
rewarding moments, especially when the Hunchback
swoops O'Hara off to Notre Dame, hoists her prone
body over his head and cries 'Sanctuary' to the
enormous, approving crowd.  Now that is cinema!</P>
