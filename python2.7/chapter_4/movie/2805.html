<PRE>"Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad!"
            -Lewis to Harrelson</PRE>
<P>     NATURAL BORN KILLERS is an acquired taste, make no mistake.  Good,
bad, *and* ugly, Oliver Stone's hilarious satire on media
sensationalism is a kaleidoscope portrait of America as seen through
the eyes of someone on a bad acid trip.</P>
<P>     Expanding upon the narrative techniques employed in JFK, Stone
uses every trick in the book to tell the story of Mickey and Mallory
(Harrelson and Lewis), two Bonnie-and-Clyde serial killers who capture
the hearts of non-victims all across America.</P>
<P>     With his crack team of collaborators and a year's worth of
editing, Stone has mixed 35mm, Super 8, animation, rear projection,
slow-motion, fast-motion, and video with a dazzling array of stock
footage, film clips, and other assorted images.  The effect is all at
once impressive, overpowering, and, well, aimless.</P>
<P>     The multimedia tricks are a hallucinatory treat, for sure, but the
director uses them on *every* character in the film--not just Mickey
and Mallory.  The result is sledgehammer saturation, if you will, that
weighs the film down by the end.  Simply, it gets old.</P>
<P>     Acting credits are superb, though, even if the characters
(literally) resemble cartoons.</P>
<P>     Harrelson and Lewis are a match made in movie heaven, with Woody
exhibiting some scary signs of intelligence.  Tommy Lee Jones is a
riot, sporting slick hair and Carl Perkins sideburns to play a prison
warden.  Tom Sizemore has a field day overacting as the
bad-cop-gone-worse hired by Mr. Jones to arrange an "accident" for
Mickey and Mal.</P>
<P>     And give some respect to Rodney Dangerfield, perfectly cast as
Mallory's father.  He gets his in a hilarious flashback staged as a
sitcom.</P>
<P>     The story was written by Quentin Tarantino (RESERVOIR DOGS, PULP
FICTION) and that's obvious.  Bullets fly, body parts are eviscerated,
and everyone says f*** every other word.  Heck, the fact that this orgy
of violence came from a major studio, alone is reason enough to see
it!  Listen for a great exchange between Jones and Sizemore--including
a hilarious off-color Oswald joke!--late in the film.</P>
<P>     Rewrites came from three others, including Stone who, undoubtedly,
was responsible for a slightly strange midsection involving an Indian
mystic and his rattlesnakes.  Shades of THE DOORS?  Rewriting also
added the entire commentary that culminates in a short montage of Amy
Fisher, O. J. Simpson, and Tonya Harding landing square on her
Buttafuoco.</P>
<PRE>DATE LINE:  Take a sensitive soul to see this with you--you'll have
            twice the fun hearing them recoil in shock and horror.</PRE>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:    Violent as all get-out, it's the best head-trip of the
                year.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: A-</PRE>
<PRE>.
