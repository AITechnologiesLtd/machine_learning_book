<PRE>                         THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG
                       (LES PARAPLUIES DE CHERBOURG)
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     So, do you like musicals?  Do you like opera?  How about a blend?
The classic 1964 film THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG (LES PARAPLUIES DE
CHERBOURG) by director Jacques Demy has been restored and rereleased to
the theaters.  Yes, it will undoubtedly make its way soon to video, but
for my money, I think you should see it in all of its radiant colors in
a real movie house and not a living room.</P>
<P>     There is a long history behind this restoration, but from what I
can gather, the key facts are that the film was originally shot on an
unstable type of film so that the colors faded quickly.  Even if you
saw the movie when it first came out, the colors may have already begun
to fade significantly by then.  They somehow found an original 3 color
separation negative and from that they reconstructed the color as it
was always intended to look.  For those of you who are specialists in
this area of film, please do not fill up my in-box with trivial reasons
why this is not quite the right explanation.  It is probably close
enough for the average movie goer.</P>
<P>     At any rate, this is a picture that looks spectacular.  The colors
are bright primary ones with blue and yellow tones dominating.  In fact
the cinematography by Jean Rabier has colors so saturated that if it
were on TV you might try to turn the color intensity knob down some to
"fix" the color.  Suffice it to say that it is the color that is
actually the best part of the show!</P>
<P>     THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG does have a plot, good acting, and
pleasant singing so it is more than just a splash of color.  The film
starts with the most impressive and lovely sequence in the movie.  The
camera is shooting straight down onto a cobblestone street.  Each stone
looks like it has been individually chosen for its lush and radiant
color.  The rain starts to pour although it appears the cloud must be a
mile high and about 4 foot wide based on the pattern of the rain.  Soon
people come strolling by except you can not see them given the angle of
the shot.  All you can see is their brightly colored umbrellas.  Their
walking pace intensifies until the film switches to a scene in a
garage.</P>
<P>     An auto mechanic named Guy (Nino Castelnuovo) is in love with
Genevieve Emery (Catherine Deneuve).  Her mother, Madame Emery (Anne
Vernon), does not approve of this match as she wants someone wealthier
for her daughter.  The umbrella theme reappears since Madame Emery runs
an umbrella shop.  From there the show goes on with Genevieve getting
pregnant, and Guy going into the army.</P>
<P>     None of the plot is important.  I love opera, especially Wagnerian
opera.  Now, if you read the plot of any opera or ponder the words, you
will probably never "waste" your time seeing it.  It is the same here.
THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG is first and foremost a musical and a
display of cinematic color richness and gorgeous sets (Bernard Evein).
If you do not like music and not care about the images of a film, don't
waste your time with this movie.</P>
<P>     Some words about the acting.  Catherine Deneuve and Nino
Castelnuovo are handsome actors with infectiously bright spirits.  The
acting is light, but lovely.  I had no idea how beautiful and innocent
looking Catherine Deneuve was.  The last film I saw her in was BELLE DE
JOUR (1967), and she was made to look harsh in that one.</P>
<P>     The singing is of the recitative variety where all of the words
are lightly sung rather than spoken.  If you are used to the more
traditional musical like THE SOUND OF THE MUSIC, you may be surprised
at how different this technique is.  There are no big musical numbers,
but rather people talk in a singing voice.  It reminded me of the
priest singing the Eucharist rather than saying it.  I liked the
singing in THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG, but I must confess, I like the
traditional musical with big musical numbers more.</P>
<P>     THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG runs just 1:27.  It is in French with
English subtitles.  It is not rated but I would guess it to be PG-13
material for some of the themes presented.  It is probably fine for
kids over 10.  Although I confess that I got a little tired of
recitative, I loved the images and the fresh acting, so I am
recommending this film to you and awarding it ***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
