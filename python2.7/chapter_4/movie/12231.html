<PRE>REVIEW: In the Company of Men</PRE>
<PRE>by Luke Buckmaster</PRE>
<PRE>5 stars out of 5</PRE>
<P>If there were ever such a thing as the opposite of a chick flick, In the
Company of Men would be it.  Working with a mere budget of US $25,000 yet
achieving the filmmakers trophy from the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, this is
truly an independent and very daring drama fueled by the desire to showcase
exactly how destructive people can be.</P>
<P>Chad (Aaron Eckhart) and Howard (Matt Malloy) are two corporate businessmen who
have been mucked around with by women a few too many times.  One night in a bar
room they decide that in order to reek revenge on women in general, they will
target a vulnerable lady, take advantage of her and break her heart.  Shell be
reaching for the sleeping pills within a week, Chad says to Howard, And you
and me will laugh about this until were very old men.</P>
<P>Soon after their arrival in an unnamed town, where they spend 6 weeks working
out business affairs, Chad meets a charming and beautiful deaf woman named
Suzanne (Stacey Edwards).  He immediately picks her out as a perfect target, and
both guys overwhelm the young lady by dating her and giving much needed
attention.  Suzanne begins to fall for Chad, and feel sorry for Howard.</P>
<P>What becomes of this platter of charm, emotional power and verbal violence is
really quite extraordinary.  In the Company of Men shows more than anything else
that the power and dexterity of the spoken word is back, and is very much alive
in independent films.  As Aaron Eckhart said during an interview last year: It
s not that Hollywood cant do it, I just dont think they can trust it.</P>
<P>Newcomer director Neil LaBute has shown astonishing skill in creating what
should be known as the best film to slip past the realms of mainstream cinema
since last years Sling Blade.  Its dangerously powerful, impeccably acted,
sharply written and so corporately controversial that it may be simply too
overwhelming for some audiences.</P>
<P>The integrity, and the skill, that is so shrewdly evident all throughout means
that it will not be quickly forgottenand I know it will lurk in the dark alleys
of my mind whenever I see a couple together on the silver screen again.</P>
<P>Enjoy it on its entertaining merits  there are plenty of them - but beware: its
riveting, disturbing stuff.  And its utterly brilliant.</P>
