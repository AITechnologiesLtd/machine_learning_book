<P>"A Room for Romeo Brass" is alternately a tender suburban comedy and a harsh 
cautionary tale about a violent psychopath. Yes, that is as weird as it 
sounds. On my way out of the screening, I glanced over a synopsis which 
described the movie as a "tender coming-of-age tale". Thank goodness that's 
an inaccurate description -- if coming-of-age were as unsettling as this 
movie, most people would commit suicide before getting out of high school.</P>
<P>The movie takes place in Nottingham, where we meet two schoolchildren, Romeo 
(Andrew Shim) and Gavin (Ben Marhsall). The two exchange playful insults, but 
are close, really, spending every day together and depending on each other's 
moral support to get through their hardships: Romeo has been abandoned by his 
father, except for occasional visits which provoke huge family rows; Gavin is 
awaiting a serious back operation.</P>
<P>Early in the story, the boys are involved in a fight with two older lads, 
which is broken up by the quaint Morell (Paddy Considine), a scruffy chap who 
tells odd stories and seems somewhat clueless as to how most people behave. 
When dropping Romeo home, he meets the lad's sister Ladine (Vicky McClure), 
is instantly attracted to her and proceeds to pester her for a date.</P>
<P>Feeling sorry for this social misfit, Ladine eventually agrees, which is a 
mistake, as it makes him a permanent fixture around the neighbourhood. He 
befriends Romeo, but secretly obsesses over Ladine and threatens Gavin's 
family, in sinister scenes which reveal Morell to be an angry, disturbed 
individual. But at times his phoney accent, conversational tangents and 
shifty body language are presented as comic. I wouldn't have minded if the 
film had started in this vain and then gradually become serious, but even 
after the introduction of danger, the film still feels able to dart in and 
out of tomfoolery.</P>
<P>At first this is embarrassing; it goes on long enough to be repellent. Things 
get confusing, too, in terms of the characters' interaction with each other. 
We never see Romeo and Gavin fall out, for example, but halfway through the 
movie they suddenly start avoiding each other, then start speaking awkwardly, 
and finally become mates again. Eh?</P>
<P>Each scene is involving in itself, whether funny, creepy, or whatever, but 
the movie as a put-together whole doesn't go anywhere or make a whole lot of 
sense. Is there a point to this juxtaposition of dark terror and light 
humour? The director is Shane Meadows, whose feature debut was the excellent 
"TwentyFourSeven" (1998), a straightforward, moving story of a boxing 
instructor helping the kids in his area stay on the straight and narrow. 
We'll have to take "A Room for Romeo Brass" as a case of the Sophomore Slump 
-- the jinx that often affects directors of terrific first films, making 
their second ones muddled and odd.</P>
