<P>1999's "The Blair Witch Project" was a landmark, groundbreaking motion 
picture--a $250,000 cinema verite-style pseudo-documentary that ended up 
becoming the must-see film of the summer and making over $140-million. Its 
financial and mostly critical success, however, did not win over some 
viewers, who passionately hated everything about its shaky-cam, 
"you-are-there" style of filmmaking. For every person who felt it was one of 
the most frightening movies they had ever seen, there was another who 
disliked it for the exact opposite reason, stating that it wasn't scary in 
the least. A horror film that became the biggest-grossing independent movie 
of all time, still, can only mean one thing, and that's a sequel.</P>
<P>With the directing reigns being handed over from Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel 
Myrick to, coincidentally, documentarian Joe Berlinger (making his fictional 
feature film debut), "Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2" is the type of hugely 
hyped sequel that is just asking for trouble. By taking a more mainstream 
approach to the Blair Witch legend, in the auspicious screenplay by Dick 
Bebee and Joe Berlinger, the movie is bound to disappoint fans who were 
expecting more of the same, while keeping those detractors of the original in 
the dark with another story that raises more questions than answers. 
Nevertheless, "Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2" is clever, entertaining, and 
thought-provoking, a purely original thriller that is able to stand on its 
own two feet.</P>
<P>A fictional account of what happened to five grad students following the 
release of the original "Blair Witch Project" in the summer of 1999, "BW2" 
follows a group of twentysomethings who agree to take part in the 
self-proclaimed Blair Witch Hunt, an Internet-based organization begun by 
Jeffrey (Jeffrey Donovan), in which he and four curiosity-seekers, including 
a couple (Stephen Baker Turner, Tristen Skyler) writing a book on the Blair 
Witch hysteria, a Wiccan (Erica Leehrsen), and a psychic goth girl (Kim 
Director), travel to the Black Hills of Burkittsville, MD to retrace the 
footsteps of Heather, Mike, and Josh. Following a night spent partying and 
drinking among the ruins of Rustin Parr's house (the place where the original 
climaxed), they awaken to discover that they have no recollection of the past 
five hours, with the only possible answers lying within the video camera that 
Jeffrey had been using, a 'la Heather Donahue.</P>
<P>Setting up shop at Jeffrey's apartment (in the form of an old, dilapidated 
factory located in the middle of the woods), the five of them plan to sift 
through the tapes, hoping to put the aforementioned fragmented night 
together, which left them all with mysterious marks on their body. As Tristen 
grows more and more unhinged following a miscarriage, Erica starts to fear 
for her life, and they all begin to have spooky hallucinations from beyond 
the grave, the questionable Blair Witch myth gradually proves itself to be 
all too real.</P>
<P>A one-of-a-kind masterpiece that ultimately saw itself overcome with hype, 
the novelty of "The Blair Witch Project" could never be duplicated, and 
luckily, director Berlinger (1996's brilliant "Paradise Lost: The Child 
Murders at Robin Hood Hills") realized this before filming a carbon copy. 
Equipped with a script, subtle special effects, a steadicam, and a more 
visceral approach, "Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2" succeeds in the fresh way 
in which it tells its story, which is not a direct sequel to its predecessor 
as much as a fictional, occasionally satirical study on the effects the first 
film had on audiences and the media.</P>
<P>Unlike the unflinchingly real, improvised performances of Heather Donahue, 
Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams, the cast populating "Book of Shadows" 
have an actual screenplay to work with and, thus, are not nearly as 
impressive. Granted, many of their acting abilities are questionable, and the 
characters played by Erica Leehrsen and Tristen Skylar are overly annoying, 
but they do respectable jobs for primarily newcomers. Easily the standout in 
what could be a star-making appearance, Kim Director (whose only previous 
credits include bit parts in many recent Spike Lee films, including 1999's 
"Summer of Sam" and 2000's "Bamboozled") is an alluring, charismatic presence 
in the role of a good-natured fan of "The Blair Witch Project" who finds 
herself under suspicions simply because of her goth chick persona.</P>
<P>While never truly scary, the picture does contain several disturbing moments, 
not the least being the way the film toys with the fine line between 
perception and reality, and the hallucinatory sights of dead children, 
previous victims of dead serial killer Rustin Parr. With an ominous music 
score by Carter Burwell and atmospheric cinematography by Nancy Schreiber, 
"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2" is inferior to the incomparable series 
opener (as expected), but is much better than could possibly be expected. By 
concluding on a cliffhanging note that leaves much of what happened in the 
previous 85 minutes up to you to decide, the film is nothing short of 
intriguing, and as a horror-mystery opening on Halloween weekend, is the 
perfect way to spend the spooky holiday.</P>
