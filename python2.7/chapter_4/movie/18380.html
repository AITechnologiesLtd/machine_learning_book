A STRANGER AMONG US
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Sydney Lumet is the director whose work happens to be of
varied quality. He is praised for some of the most important
films of the previous decades, like TWELVE ANGRY MEN,
SERPICO or THE VERDICT. But, in the same time, almost any of
such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper Lumet's
reputation. A STRANGER AMONG US, 1992 rip-off of Peter
Weir's WITNESS, belongs to the latter category.</P>
<P>The heroine of this movie is Emily Eden (Melanie Griffith),
tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in
battling bad guys on the streets of New York. During one of
such actions, her partner Nick (Jamey Sheridan) got hurt and
as a result, she becomes depressed. In order to help her
recover, bosses give her rather easy task of locating
missing jeweller who belonged to Hassidic Jew community.
Emily starts investigation and soon realises that the case
involves murder. Concluding that the perpetrator belongs to
community, she decides to go undercover. That isn't easy,
because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist
ways. Things get even more complicated when she develops
feelings for young cabalistic scholar Ariel (Eric Thal).</P>
<P>Using Peter Weir's formula isn't the greatest flaw of this
film. Even the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot
works to the certain extent. But the worst insult to
viewer's audience is terrible miscasting of Melanie
Griffith. The author of this review never liked this actress
very much, but she was at least tolerable in some of her
roles. Role of Emily Eden, unfortunately, isn't one of them.
First of all, she can't pass for tough NYPD street fighter,
and her attempt to pass for Orthodox Jewish woman isn't much
better. Screenplay by Robert J. Avrech makes things even
worse with some formulaic red herring subplots (scene
involving two Italian gangsters was almost too painful to
watch). But, on the other hand, other actors are more
convincing (Lee Richardson as an old rabbi, Thal as Ariel
and charming Mia Sara as his intended bride), and the
photography by Andrzej Bartkowiak very effectively creates
atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in Hassidic
community. Also, the film might educate viewers about
Hassidic culture. That is the only thing that prevents it
from turning into total waste of time.</P>
