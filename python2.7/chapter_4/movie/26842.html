<PRE>Mamma Fado
The Art of Amalia</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>With an eccentric introduction by the delightfully eccentric David Byrne,
this documentary spans the lifetime career of Portuguese's singing gem,
Amalia Rodriguez. Born in 1920, Amalia's natural talent brought her quickly
to the forefront of international music and easily held her there nearly to
the end of her life in 1999.</P>
<P>Though dabbling in other styles, Amalia is synonymous with Fado - the
Portuguese version of blues. As Amalia puts it, "Fado is Lament."</P>
<P>Filmed in traditional documentary style; we watch clip after clip of this
vocal treasure singing her heart out with intermittent historical commentary
by the English speaking narrator. From Portugal to France to Italy to the
USA, the documentary opens our eyes to TV in other countries. Amalia's own
remembrances captured in an interview during the last year of her life are
added to the mix. She speaks in Portuguese, while subtitles flash across the
screen. It's a pleasant enough recipe for a half-hour program, but looses
its punch by the hour mark. Interviews with friends and loved ones would
have helped.</P>
<P>Additionally, the program seldom delves below the surface of success.
Turning the angle to explore how a "singer of the sad" handles success and
stardom could have enhanced the attraction of this production. Amalia
herself says, "I was never really happy. I was never a cheerful person." Her
frank demeanor and obvious talent make her naturally fascinating ... but the
film attends only a glossy nostalgia.</P>
<P>Minor suggestions: Three or four times subtitles wisp across the screen
faster than the average reader can grasp. Slow them down by taking advantage
of the moments when the interviewee is paused between sentences. The mention
of a blues collaboration begged a sample clip, though none was offered.
Lastly, the film comes to a close with only a brief footnote that Amalia had
died a week before its completion. In consistent fashion, no further
information is given regarding her death, leaving the audience wondering.
Placing this footnote prior to the last long cut of Amalia singing, would
have at least emphasized its treasure while ending the film on a sigh and a
tear instead of a question mark.</P>
<P>Even if Fado is not your fancy, they'll be no avoiding the genuine allure of
Amalia Rodrigues' fantastic voice. Recorded through inferior microphones,
stored on imperfect film and out-dated tape formats, the rich tonal quality
of her voice still rings resilient. She must have been absolutely chilling
in person.</P>
