<PRE>MICKEY BLUE EYES
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        If you've been following automotive trends as of late you'll know
that, probably around the year 2009, every single car on the road will look
like the Jeep Grand Cherokee.  A similar feeling washed over me while
watching "Mickey Blues Eyes" the other night.  "Er, didn't I just *see*
this movie?"  Of course, I did.</P>
<P>        "Mickey Blue Eyes" is a mob-related comedy that stars Hugh Grant.
It shouldn't be confused with "Analyze This," a mob-related comedy without
Hugh Grant, or "Notting Hill," a Hugh Grant comedy that has nothing
whatsoever to do with organized crime.  But after about thirteen
middle-of-the-road comedies in a row, the lines begin to blur some.</P>
<P>        This one (I think) stars Grant as a Manhattan-based auctioneer with
"floppy hair" and all those other endearing Hugh Grant mannerisms.  He's
about to pop the question to the love of his life, high-school teacher
Jeanne Tripplehorn.  Jeanne has been cozy ("The Firm") and sexy
("Waterworld") before but here's she's just plain old Jeanne, neither cozy
nor sexy and just a wee bit boring.  Think what they could have done with
Julia Roberts or, come to think of it, Robert De Niro in the Jeanne
Tripplehorn role.</P>
<P>        Jeanne is nervous about getting engaged to Hugh because her father
(a surprisingly under-the-top James Caan) is, well, "connected."  "Once
you're family, you're Family" she cautions Hugh, but the twitchy Brit
remains committed to her.  Before Jeanne can say "I told you so," Hugh's
making notes to rent "GoodFellas" and "The Godfather" trilogy, and learning
how to say "forgedabouddit."</P>
<P>        Grant is cute, as is "Mickey Blue Eyes" (co-produced by Elizabeth
Hurley no less), but I liked the Jeep a whole lot more before they made it
look like every other stinkin' SUV on the planet.</P>
