<P>     Some people have facial features which seem to come from another era;
Tilda Swinton has features from another world.  Her almost translucent
skin, high cheekbones and wide blue eyes conspire to give her a faintly
alien appearance, intelligent and curious but isolated.  Those striking,
androgynous features made her perfect for the gender-bending title role in
1993's ORLANDO.  In a different way, they also make her perfect for the
role of FEMALE PERVERSIONS' protagonist Eve Stephens.  In Susan
Streitfeld's compelling character study, Eve's psyche becomes the
battleground between a hundred different social images of womanhood.
Watching that battle in Swinton's face is, quite simply, electrifying.</P>
<P>     Eve is an up-and-coming Southern California prosecutor, up-and-coming
enough that the governor is considering her for a seat on the Court of
Appeals.  An impending judgeship should make Eve a very confident woman,
but instability seems to define every aspect of her life.  She carries on
sexual relationships simultaneously with a man (Clancy Brown) and a woman
(Karen Sillas); a strained relationship with her sister Madelyne (Amy
Madigan) becomes even more complicated when Madelyne is arrested for
shoplifting.  As her interview with the governor approaches, Eve is forced
to confront insecurities inspired by years of mixed messages about what it
means to be a woman.</P>
<P>     FEMALE PERVERSIONS takes its title the non-fiction text by Dr. Louise
J. Kaplan in which she defines "perversions" as deviations from strict
societal proscriptions on female behavior, sexuality and fantasy.  It's a
great jumping-off point for a sociological study of modern American
femininity, but Streitfeld shows a peculiar and ill-advised devotion to
her source.  The film's most awkward conceit involves the periodic 
appearance of quotes from the book in odd locations -- embroidered into
pillow-cases, as advertising on billboards and in magazines -- offering
modestly insightful epigrams like "Perverse scenarios are about desperate
need."  It's a Peter Greenaway type of stunt from a rookie director
(Streitfeld is a rehabilitated...sorry, _retired_ Hollywood agent) which
tosses generalities into the path of individual characters.</P>
<P>     Those characters, and Eve's interactions with them, really are the
"plot" of FEMALE PERVERSIONS.  Each one feels like something which began
as a case study but grew into a unique and fully-realized individual.
Madelyne's landlady Emma, who is obsessed with getting her latest
boyfriend to marry her, is played with a heartbreaking desperation by
Laila Robbins; Frances Fisher turns Emma's sister Annunciata into a tutor
in sexual manipulation; Emma's pubescent daughter Edwina (Dale Shuger) is
so terrified of her impending sexuality that she chops off her hair and
hides her body in baggy clothes.  The performances -- by Amy Madigan,
Karen Sillas, even Paulina Porizkova -- are uniformly superb, taking
snapshots of different women coping with life and giving them unexpected
vitality.</P>
<P>     We see them all through Eve's eyes, eyes which watch herself in a
news conference after winning a big case and can only see the lipstick
smeared on her teeth.  Swinton takes on the incredibly challenging role of
a woman living multiple lives -- she has to seem plausible as a competent
and effective professional who exposes herself in her lover's office,
and who flies into a disgusted rage at her fumbled response to an
interview question about her marital status.  Over the course of FEMALE
PERVERSION, Eve's confidence waxes and wanes, her remarkable face
alternately displaying confidence and deep feelings of inadequacy about
her physical appearance.  It is a performance so rich and detailed that it
feels like part of a documentary.</P>
<P>     Streitfeld stumbles when she reduces Eve's complex psychology to the
result of one childhood trauma.  FEMALE PERVERSION is about much more than
one woman's issues with Mommy and Daddy; Eve's story deals with the state
of being a woman as much as it deals with a specific woman.  Give credit
to Tilda Swinton for bringing life to an archetype, for giving a face to
the struggles of modern women.  And what a face it is.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 feminine mystiques:  8.</PRE>
