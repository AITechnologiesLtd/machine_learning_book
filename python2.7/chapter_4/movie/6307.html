<P>     SET IT OFF, which chronicles the attempts of four young black women 
to take control of their lives, may sound like it's treading a similar 
path to the one blazed by last year's tepid WAITING TO EXHALE, but 
nothing could be farther from the truth.  In the first place, although 
SET IT OFF contains some dramatic elements, it is, first and foremost, 
an action/caper film.  Secondly, all things considered, this is a much 
better picture.</P>
<P>     If SET IT OFF owes a debt to recent films, it's more to DEAD 
PRESIDENTS and THELMA AND LOUISE than to WAITING TO EXHALE.  The concept 
of four black action heroines makes for a welcome change in a genre that 
is dominated by:  (a) rugged white males with a perpetual five o'clock 
shadow, (b) rugged white males who speak English with an accent, and (c) 
rugged white males with the acting ability of a fence post.  There's a 
freshness and energy in the way director F. Gary Gray attacks this 
familiar material that keeps SET IT OFF entertaining, even during its 
weakest moments.</P>
<P>     The film doesn't get off to a promising start.  The first half-
hour, which details the various characters' motives for becoming 
involved in a bank robbery, is unevenly scripted.  There are a few too 
many contrivances and coincidences.  Once the setup is complete, 
however, things shift into high gear.  The remainder of the film, which 
includes several high-adrenaline action sequences and some slower, more 
dramatic moments, is smoothly-crafted.  There are occasional missteps, 
such as an out-of-place GODFATHER parody, but, in general, SET IT OFF 
manages to rise above these.</P>
<P>     Jada Pinkett (THE NUTTY PROFESSOR) is one of the crop of fine young 
actresses working today, and she deservedly gets more screen time than 
her co-stars.  As Stony, she's the most sympathetic of the quartet, and 
the only one who comes close to having a well-rounded personality.  The 
film opens with her prostituting herself to get the money for her 
younger brother's college tuition.  Shortly thereafter, he is dead, the 
victim of an accidental police shooting.  Stony is devastated, and her 
anger at the system makes her vulnerable to the seductive lure of easy 
money through a bank robbery.</P>
<P>     Her accomplices in crime are her best friends.  The four women, who 
have always been there to support one another, share not only a common 
history but the dream of one day escaping from the projects where they 
have lived their entire lives.  The plan's mastermind is Frankie (Vivica 
Fox), an ex-bank employee who was fired when she reacted improperly 
during a hold-up.  Tisean (Kimberly Elise) needs the money to keep her 
young son from becoming a ward of the State.  And Cleo (Queen Latifa) 
wants in on the action so she can live the high life and buy nice 
clothes for her lesbian girlfriend.  Together, after being kicked in the 
face once too often by society, these four don wigs, borrow some guns, 
walk into the South Los Angeles Bank, and take $12,000 in cash.</P>
<P>     Pinkett is backed by a solid cast, and the chemistry between the 
performers helps us believe that there's a real friendship going on.  
Rap artist-turned-actress Queen Latifa brings a toughness to her role 
that recalls blaxploitation star Pam Grier.  Vivica Fox shows a 
significantly harder edge than she did in this summer's blockbuster, 
INDEPENDENCE DAY.  Newcomer Kimberly Elise is good at making her lower 
lip tremble.  Also appearing are Blair Underwood as a banker who becomes 
romantically involved with Stony, and John C. McGinley as a surprisingly 
non-stereotypical L.A. police detective.</P>
<P>     What sets this movie apart from the innumerable other entries into 
the action/caper genre is its social perspective.  SET IT OFF doesn't 
preach, but you'd have to be blind not to recognize that there's a 
message here about the kind of desperation that can result from the 
familiar cycle of poverty, sexism, and racism.  And, although the 
marketing for SET IT OFF is geared primarily towards African Americans, 
you don't have to be black to appreciate this effective, in-your-face 
style of film making.</P>
