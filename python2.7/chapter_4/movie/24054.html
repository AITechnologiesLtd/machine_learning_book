<P>Are you, more or less, setting yourself up for disappointment if you go to 
see a film adaptation of one of the most powerfully written novels you can 
recall reading? At the time of its publication (after one publishing company 
dropped it at the last minute), Bret Easton Ellis' horrific 1991 satire was 
widely reviled by some critics for being an offensive exercise in misogyny 
towards women, a "how-to" book on slaughtering someone and getting away with 
it. They not only missed the boat, but the entire ocean with this conclusion. 
Having read Ellis' novel the week prior to seeing the controversial film 
version, what struck me was not only its gracefully flowing and mysteriously 
alluring writing style, told in first-person by the central character, but 
also its portrait of a man come unhinged, who "isn't really there," and has 
no answer for why he commits such heinous crimes except to say that it is 
close to a masturbatory experience for him. And, of course, the book offered 
a right-on-target satirical view of the '80s--full of conceited egos, wealth 
and power, and materialistic excess. In other words, Ellis may have been 
lightly poking fun, but there was a startling amount of truth in everything 
he wrote, right down to the minuscule details. </P>
<P>After several years of the film adaptation rights thrashing around from one 
studio and director to the next, "American Psycho" has finally surfaced on 
the big screen with, shock of all shocks, a female director, Mary Harron 
(1996's "I Shot Andy Warhol"), and a female collaborative screenwriting 
partner, Guinevere Turner. What we have here, however, is a motion picture 
that misses the mark in a way that the book critics did nearly a decade ago. 
While still attempting to be a satire, Harron has whittled down the book's 
casual product placement; violence; unforgettably self-absorbed, yet nuanced, 
characters; and its overall depth, to bring audiences a basic Cliffs Notes 
version of a masterful novel. In doing so, Harron has also altered a story 
supposed to be about a shallow era into a film that is, ultimately, just 
shallow. </P>
<P>Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a 27-year-old yuppie on Wall 
Street--overly wealthy; generically handsome (he looks much like the rest of 
his buff, chiseled colleagues); health conscious; womanizing; and only 
interested in "hardbodies" and getting reservations at the swankiest 
restaurants. What Patrick's coworkers and acquaintances don't know, though, 
is that he works out in his sterile, desolate apartment to the likes of 
pornos and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," and casually murders anyone he 
feels like it--old friends, bums, prostitutes, working partners, you name 
it--while spouting off a vocal review on the merits of some of his most 
beloved singers and bands, including Genesis, Whitney Houston, and Huey Lewis 
and the News. </P>
<P>Like the novel, "American Psycho" has no actual story, with a plot that moves 
from Point A to Point B and so on, but is a loose gathering of thoughts and 
moments set in the life--a rather pathetic one, at that--of Pat Bateman. A 
modicum of a story does arise after Paul Allen (Jared Leto), Patrick's 
coworker, is axed to death, and Detective Kimball (Willem Dafoe) shows up at 
Pat's job to question him about the unknown whereabouts of Paul. </P>
<P>One of the most compelling aspects of the novel was eventually realizing that 
Bateman is not a vile excuse for a human being, but simply an unstable man 
who, somewhere down the line of his life, has lost the ability to feel 
emotion, either for himself or those around him. It was a surprisingly 
poignant notion by Ellis, subtle, yet effective. The film attempts the same 
thing, but verges off-course in its conclusion to be something that almost 
begs you, in an overwrought fashion, to feel sympathy for this man.</P>
<P>Christian Bale has gotten a lot of publicity and early acclaim for his work 
as Patrick Bateman, and while he is playing a calculating character set on 
being physically perfect and financially sturdy, his performance remains cold 
and at a distance, speaking in a monotone voice that wears out its welcome 
right away. Bale is a fine actor, and he nails the adrenaline rush and 
childish excitement he gets on inflicting torture to others, but that is just 
about the only compliment he can be given. </P>
<P>All other characters are minor, as they are all merely players in Patrick's 
own little world. They are often so inconsequential onscreen, however, that 
they make no impact. Reese Witherspoon, as Patrick's equally self-absorbed 
fiancee, Evelyn, is especially wasted in comparison to the stature of the 
character in the book, with her role whittled down to a mere three brief 
scenes. Witherspoon is given no chance to create any sense of a character at 
all, and so she is forced to basically phone in her performance. The same 
goes for all of Patrick's friends (played by Bill Sage, Justin Theroux, Matt 
Ross, and Josh Lucas); his drug-addled lover, Courtney (Samantha Mathis); and 
Detective Kimball (Willem Dafoe).</P>
<P>The only two who come away unscathed, and with their full respect intact, are 
Chloe Sevigny, as Jean, Patrick's adoring secretary, and Cara Seymour, as 
Christie, a sad-eyed, ill-fated prostitute who makes the wrong decision when 
coming back to Patrick's apartment for a second rendezvous. Sevigny 
especially nails her character, the only likable one in the film, and adds a 
much-needed complexity to her scenes that is absent from the rest of the 
picture.</P>
<P>The soundtrack, filled to the brim with nostalgic '80s song, such as Phil 
Collins' "Sussudio" and Huey Lewis and the News' "Hip to Be Square," aids in 
capturing an era that, aside from the costumes and hairstyles, fails to be 
brought to life. Other credit must go to Andrzej Sekula's appropriately 
sparse cinematography, with an emphasis on space and the color white to stand 
for the emptiness in Patrick's heart. And the central murder setpiece, 
arriving approximately an hour into the film, is spectacularly suspenseful, a 
bravura piece of filmmaking reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's work in 1980's 
"The Shining." But what difference do these minor things make when the film 
at hand is an otherwise depressing, vacuous experience?</P>
<P>Thank goodness I read the book before seeing "American Psycho" because, while 
constantly being disappointed with the hack job director Harron and 
co-screenwriter Guinevere Turner have done with the source material, at least 
I could fill in the important blanks that the movie so mercifully leaves out. 
The novel notwithstanding, "American Psycho," the film, has nothing 
insightful to say about anything, not even the aforementioned subjects it 
attempts to satirize, while the dialogue comes off feeling stilted and 
annoying "written." By the time the twist ending kicks into gear in the final 
twenty minutes, most audience members will be left confused and feeling empty 
themselves, as what happens is nearly incomprehensible, with no attempt to 
bring reason or any answers to the proceedings. Although I don't want to do 
it, since film adaptations shouldn't fairly be compared to their written 
counterparts, it must be brought up once more. Having read the novel, it is 
impossible to watch "American Psycho" and not have your expectations 
tarnished, as the whole affair is an enormously large missed opportunity. 
Harron has taken nearly all that was great about Bret Easton Ellis' fine 
novel, stripped it of its dignity and profundity, and left it for the 
film-viewing world to behold as a sadly trivial, puerile, and, ultimately 
pointless, misfire.</P>
