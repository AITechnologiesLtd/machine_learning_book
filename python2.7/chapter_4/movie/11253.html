Ordinary People (1980)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 97</PRE>
<P>"Ordinary People" was the star of the 1981 Academy Awards.
Best Picture, Best Director (Robert Redford), Best Screenplay
(Alvin Sargent), Best Supporting Actor (Timothy Hutton, 
in his first cinema film).</P>
<P>But there was immediate griping afterwards, which has
continued ever since.  "Raging Bull" should have won Best
Picture, naysayers said.  I have not yet graded "Raging Bull".
I am sure that it is an outstanding film.  But "Ordinary People"
is one of the best films ever, and well deserved its Academy
Awards.  Indeed, I know of only one film that won Best Picture
that is clearly better: "Casablanca".  "Schindler's List"
and "Chinatown" are about equal in quality to "Ordinary People."</P>
<P>While "Ordinary People" is an outstanding film, it is not a
popular one.  Action dregs such as "The Beastmaster" series
get more showings on television.  It is easy to see why many
people (men, in particular) would prefer to watch "Raging Bull".
It's more entertaining watching Robert De Niro play a boxing
champion than watching Timothy Hutton struggle with depression.</P>
<P>But a film shouldn't be judged by how happy it makes you feel.
"Ordinary People" may be difficult to watch, but that only adds
to its quality: it faces truths that people do not want to see.</P>
<P>"Ordinary People" is the story of a troubled upper-middle-class
family.  Timothy Hutton is the guilt-ridden son who survived
a boating accident that killed his brother, and who has recently
been released from a hospital after a near-fatal suicide attempt.
Mary Tyler Moore is his mother, who has repressed her grief and
hostility towards her son, yet tries to pretend that life can
go on as before.  Donald Sutherland is her husband, who finds
himself caught in the middle between wife and son, want to keep
both, but is powerless to repair the shattered family.</P>
<P>There's also an excellent supporting cast.  Judd Hirsch is
Hutton's psyciatrist, who seeks to pry Hutton out from his
emotional shell.  Elizabeth McGovern is Hutton's love interest,
and M. Emmet Walsh is his disbelieving swimming coach.</P>
