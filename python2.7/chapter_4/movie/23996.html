<PRE>"Rules of Engagement" -- Tommy Lee Jones Exonerates
Mild Courtroom Drama
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>"Rules of Engagement" is a film that starts off
promisingly as a drama that combines the elements of
friendship, honor, sacrifice and conspiracy.  But just
when it seems that the power of the film is about to
be unleashed, the movie somehow implodes.  It switches
gears in the latter half of the film and becomes a
debate about military ethics and codes of conduct,
ultimately degenerating into a formulaic military
courtroom drama.  We know that at some point during
the trial, the accused will slam the podium in front
of him in disgust, stand up, and let forth a roar that
sounds conspicuously like "you can't handle the
truth."</P>
<P>The film begins with an intense and well-executed
Vietnam-era battle sequence that introduces us to
Childers (Samuel L. Jackson) and Hodges (Tommy Lee
Jones), two soldiers in the same unit that become
lifelong friends.   This battle results in heavy
casualties, though these two are lucky enough to
survive.  Hodges finishes out his military career as a
mildly successful lawyer.  Childers, however, has
continued to serve his country admirably through
several dangerous conflicts, and is now a highly
decorated Colonel.  </P>
<P>The courtroom sequence that I mention above occurs as
a result of the actions taken by Childress. He and his
troop are sent on a difficult mission to protect a
foreign embassy and its diplomat (Ben Kingsley) from
an unruly mob.  At the scene, rocks are being thrown,
bullets are being shot, and firebombs are being
ignited.  The situation is getting ugly.  Childers'
men are coming under fire that causes him to issue a
questionable order.  This has dire ramifications for
him and for our country.  To quell the international
furor that has arisen, a conspiracy begins to rear its
ugly head.  As a result, Childress will be
court-martialed and may face a long prison sentence.</P>
<P>Childress asks Hodges to defend him.  At first
reluctant, Hodges says, "I'm good enough to know that
you need someone better than me."  But it's hard for
him to refuse his lifelong friend.  He works quickly
to gather evidence, to interview witnesses, and to
determine the fate of videotape that may exonerate
him.</P>
<P>Once the story moved inside the courtroom, however,
the momentum generated begins to dissipate.  This is
not the fault of Jones and Jackson, who are two very
talented actors.  But there is nothing less satisfying
than watching a couple of attorneys question and
cross-examine a slew of witnesses as they try to
convince a jury that their particular case is the one
to believe.  Even worse, there are many missed
opportunities that could have been effectively used. 
For example, the diplomat gives false testimony to
make himself look better.  His wife (Anne Archer)
knows that he's lying.  We are teased with the
possibility that this will lead to something dramatic.
 But it never happens.  </P>
<P>Despite the fact that "Rules of Engagement" loses much
of its momentum during the trial phase, there were
still enough positive points to recommend this
offering.  It starts off as a taut and suspenseful
film.  Good points about combat ethics and actions
under fire are brought up.  Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel
L. Jackson bring wit and energy to their roles.  There
is also an undeniable pleasure derived from watching
the gritty Jones defend his friend against the
tenacious government prosecutor (Guy Pearce).  But
given the ethical quandaries that the film brings
forth, the film's resolution was too quick and easy. 
There seems to be a message that is trying to be sent.
 The film is unconvincing in its ability to deliver
it.</P>
