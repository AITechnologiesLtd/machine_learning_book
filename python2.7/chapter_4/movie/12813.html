<PRE>REVIEW: Good Burger
By Luke Buckmaster (<A HREF="mailto:bucky@alphalink.com.au">bucky@alphalink.com.au</A>)</PRE>
<P>>From zero stars (bomb), to five stars (a masterpiece): One star</P>
<PRE><HR></PRE>
<P>With every new children's film comes a regurgitated fear that lurks
inside my hate-bone.  A fear of plot failure and cornball acting.   Of
flat jokes - and even flatter dialogue.  Yes indeed, these are the
movies that squeeze every last gag from a worn out sponge - praying that
the critics will label them as "kids material" so that adults will be
blissfully ignorant of them.  In Good Burger, a Nickelodeon film, my
fears were back as I witnessed a tasteless, immature and half-fried glob
of film-fat.</P>
<P>If that comment sounded a little farcical, then you'll have to forgive
me - but Good Burger deserves it entirely.  You see, I work at a
McDonalds store (no joke).  I know what it's like to accidentally open a
packet of sundae mix at the wrong time and have it dripping off my body
from shoulder to toe.  I know what a burger looks like with a litre of
ketchup on top of it, because I've dropped a container of it on one.  I
know the satisfaction of giving a hungry customer the meal he was been
waiting on, just for him to say "Tell you're manager that he's fucking
useless if he can't produce a Big Mac."</P>
<P>But I've still been able to look back and laugh in disbelief - at those
good memories that were actually nightmares to experience at the time.
But I look back on Good Burger in exactly the same frame of mind as to
when I watching it - disgruntled, irritated. It's not that I have a deep
and profound respect for my job (you don't get much as a burger cooker
or chicken fryer), but rather that Good Burger had a potential gold mine
of gags to play with but doesn't utilize any of them.</P>
<P>The basic scenario of Good Burger goes something like this: the lazy,
self-seeking Dexter (Kenan Thompson) finds himself in dept of more money
than he can possibly repay after wrecking his school teachers car on the
first day of summer vacation.  After much reluctance, he vows to get a
job until the dept is paid off.  Enter "Good Burger," a no frills fast
food outlet that becomes the hippest place to be when extravagant worker
Ed (Kel Mitchell) unleashes a secret sauce to the public.  But the
store's scandalous competitor, "Monolith Burger," will stop at nothing
to get hold of the ingredients of Ed's sauce.</P>
<P>Dexter and Ed also find themselves in other unpredictable situations
including being trapped in an insane asylum with their 77-year-old pal
Otis (Abe Vigoda).  This in particular is a cruel and insensitive
scenario, which demonstrates the film's tendency to make fun of
everything and anyone just for the hope of drawing a laugh.</P>
<P>The director, Brian Robbins (who co-created the Nickelodeon show for
which the film is based, "All That"), is only partially to blame for
Good Burger's lack of raillery and effective composition.  In the end,
it boils down to the team of writers responsible for All That - they
have not succeeded to sufficiently convert the television show to the
big screen.  Whilst it may be appropriate to occasionally show a
"Nickelodeon sketch comedy" style gag, too many becomes plain annoying -
and if they aren't very good from the start - well, the fats in the
fryer.  If I want to watch an hour and a half of Nickelodeon, I'll
arrange to get cable TV - but if I'm going to the cinema, I need
something better.  I need something that will hold my attention -
something that is worthy of being on the silver screen in the first
place.</P>
<P>I have no doubt that even my McDonalds manager, Steve, would be able to
shed more light on this greasy, pointless film.</P>
<P>To give you some sort of idea of how bad Good Burger's gags come; I'll
leave you with a scene involving Ed and an evil Monolith Burger
employee:</P>
<P>Monolith Burger Guy: You better watch your butt!
Ed: [Tries for 5 minutes, spinning round and round in circles] I give
up. There is no way a guy can watch his own butt.</P>
