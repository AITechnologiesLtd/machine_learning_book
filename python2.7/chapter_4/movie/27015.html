<P>Bah humbug! It seems as though the season of cheer has arrived, along with
the bells, the whistles, the remake of a classic American Christmas
tale...huh?!? Stop the presses. Okay, so nobody really needed to renovate
this timeless cartoon featuring the memorable narration by Boris Karloff and
the symphonic rhymes of the Doctor they call Seuss, but alas, we're dealing
with Hollywood here, and classics equal money, right? Let's see how things
turned out.</P>
<P>PLOT:
The Grinch lives with his dog, up in a mountain, overseeing a town called
Whoville, inhabited by the happy-go-lucky Whos. The Whos are a joyous folk,
they love their Christmas and they are afraid of the Grinch. The Grinch
doesn't like the Whos or Christmas for that matter, and upon this very
evening, the Grinch has taken it upon himself to visit this little town, and
steal Christmas away from the Whos.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Your appreciation of this film will likely hinge on whether or not you enjoy
the character of the Grinch in this movie, and for me, well, he just didn't
click. Carrey did play the character brilliantly but I just didn't think any
of his many shticks were funny. But I might be in the minority here because
many audience members around me (mostly kiddies) were crackin' up quite
some. To me, it just felt like Carrey doing his old MASK character in a
Grinch suit. I'm also a huge fan of the original story upon which this film
is based, and was quite disappointed with many of the over-the-top
"Hollywood" additions to the film. Like the prerequisite "bad guy" in
Whoville (where'd he come from?), the phony baloney romance with the Grinch
(you'd think that they could've come up with a better back story than the
fact that he was laughed at in school) and some of the kooky things that
they made the Grinch say ("The sun is right, and the powder's bitchin"?).
Brrrrrr. And what the heck happened to the classic "You're a Mean One"
song?!? Yikes! Bells and whistles don't always make things better, folks.
And despite a great "feeling" of Whoville all around, and solid effects to
boot, I wasn't sure if everything in this movie was supposed to look like
one big set filled with fake snow, or if that was just part of the whole
Whoville lore (looking conspiciously like Disneyworld's ToonTown, I might
add). But overall, I dug the "feel" of the film.</P>
<P>Mind you, it would've been nice to see more special effects added to the
film, to give it that extra level of fantasy. Any-who, don't let me
completely discourage you here because some of the elements in this film did
work. I liked the way that the whole thing was shot, much like a cartoon,
big and bulky and shiny and happy. I also loved the girl who played Little
Cindy Lou-Who, she was absolutely adorable! And the narration was another
highlight, hearing Anthony Hopkins deliver many of those classic lines felt
just right. But overall, the film seemed to be produced for a new generation
of Grinch fans. Children whose parents have stacked wallets to purchase
mucho Grinch products! And that is something I certainly won't
dispute...kids should really dig this flick! I don't generally compare
remakes to their originals, as I feel that every film should be critiqued
based on their own merits, but sadly I could not help but draw comparison
here, seeing as this was based on one of my personal favorite childhood
memories. Sigh. But even without those memories, this film simply didn't do
enough to win me over. If you like Carrey's Grinch character in this film,
with all of his one-liners, his exaggerated facial expressions et al, you
will probably enjoy this movie for what it is. A frivolous sock-hop at the
movie house. For me, the Grinch will always be that quiet, misunderstood
green dude at the top of that mountain. The guy with a mysterious past, an
uncertain future and a knack for meanness. Grinchy-poo, you used to be a
mean one...now you're just a goof. Sigh. Cha-chink.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Anthony Hopkins narrated all of his dialogue for this movie in one day.
Screenwriter Jeffrey Price also had a hand in writing WILD WILD WEST and WHO
FRAMED ROGER RABBIT.
Wanna know how much "snow" was used on the sets for this movie? Apparently
enough to cover nine football fields. Number of ornaments in the film? 8200.
Number of candy canes? 1938.
You don't have to look too hard to see director Ron Howard's family members
packed into this cast. Brother Clint is there, as well as his dad Rance and
Bryce Howard. And who's this Jeremy Howard? Any relation?
Hmmmm, I didn't notice him myself but Mini-Me, Verne Troyer, also has a part
in this movie.
Jim Carrey actually sings "You're a Mean One" in this film.</P>
