<PRE>                            FATHER OF THE BRIDE
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     FATHER OF THE BRIDE is a film directed by Charles Shyer.  It stars
Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, with Martin Short.</P>
<P>     FATHER OF THE BRIDE is a remake of the 1950 classic of the same
name; the original, in turn based on a novel by Edward Streeter, and
directed by Vincente Minnelli, starred Spencer Tracy, Joan Bennett, and
Elizabeth Taylor, with Don Taylor as the groom.  The new film uses many
of the same scenes and even the original dialog (written by Frances
Goodrich and Albert Hackett).  The new one has a lot of laughs and good,
old-fashioned tears, but it doesn't quite work as well as the Spencer
Tracy version.</P>
<P>     For one thing, Steve Martin is no Spencer Tracy, or is that stating
the obvious?  Instead of bumbling warmth and endearing yet manly
clumsiness, we get treated to 45 or 60 minutes of THE JERK as Martin
tries not to deal with the prospect of his daughter getting married.
Martin's having a major cheap attack and maybe some sublimated sexual
jealousy.  I like Martin, but warm he ain't.</P>
<P>     For another, the two principal women characters are non-entities.
Joan Bennett provided wisdom, humor, and a guiding hand to that wedding
41 years ago.  Diane Keaton grins, smirks, and smiles mostly.  She has
one scene where she rather gently asserts herself, but mostly she comes
off as a money-spending machine.  Supposedly, she has her own career,
but the film is so uninterested in her as to never actually tell us what
that career might be.  (Bennett was the driving force behind the big
blow-out in the original--because she had missed out on a big wedding
for herself and was seizing a second chance through her daughter; Keaton
is mostly along for the ride.)</P>
<P>     Kimberly Williams, the bride to be, will never win in a blind
comparison with post-ingenue Elizabeth Taylor.  Taylor's bride wanted to
elope.  Williams' bride wants a $1200 wedding cake.  She's not a bad
sort, but she's not exactly the modern woman the film wants us to
believe she is.  She's going to be a great architect, she doesn't want
veal at the reception dinner (she's heard something), she calls the
wedding off for no better reason than Taylor called hers off.  On the
other hand, her one-on-one basketball is one of the best scenes in the
movie and we do have some reason to think there's more to her than a
well-thumbed copy of BRIDE'S MAGAZINE.  </P>
<P>     Martin Short plays the flamboyant wedding coordinator, playing  it
as an offensive cliche with an incomprehensible and obviously synthetic
accent.  His assistant is played by an actor whose name may be
W. D. Wong (apologies to all of Mr. Wong's fans if I've bolixed his
initials) with better grace and more authenticity.  The only good thing
about Short's performance, which is blown up beyond all reason to
accommodate his presence in the movie, is that Martin's reactions are
markedly less homophobic as the wedding plans proceed and Martin becomes
reconciled to hosting the most tasteless wedding ever seen in San
Marino, California.</P>
<P>     And really, this where the new movie most seriously fails us.
Upper middle class family spends $200,000 for daughter's wedding ($250
per person, over 500 guests) and no one feels anything is out of
proportion.  The groom's parents live in "real" mansion and offer to
help out, but no one offers to put the brakes on the Wedding from Hell
in the name of anything like common decency, only in the name of not 
wanting to have a wedding in the first place.  </P>
<P>     And there is, appropriately, a product placement for Spode.</P>
<P>     The best things about this new FATHER OF THE BRIDE are the love and
family feelings.  Ultimately, this is, after all, a tear-jerker.  We are
allowed to cry at weddings.  And we do.  All around me couples, moms and
dads, dates, were cuddling through the last sequence, people were
sniffling happily, and folks were feeling fine.  The next best thing is
Martin is pretty funny and does some of his great physical shtick.</P>
<PRE>     I predict that people will take to this FATHER OF THE BRIDE.</PRE>
<P>     However, I cannot recommend it to you for more than cheap matinee
prices.  </P>
<P>     You might want to hunt the video of the Spencer Tracy version, too.
It is still a very watchable film with legendary stars and a great
director.</P>
