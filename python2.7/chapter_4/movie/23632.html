<P>A Review by Akiva Gottlieb
In 1995, a group of distinguished Scandinavian
filmmakers decided that today's films lack purity. So
they wrote up a manifesto called Dogme 95; a set of
rules that a filmmaker should follow in order to make
a `pure' film. According to the manifesto, a film
should be shot on digital video, use natural props and
light, not fit into a specific genre or credit its
director.</P>
<P>In 1998, Thomas Vinterberg helmed the first Dogme
film, `The Celebration', which won unanimous critical
praise for transcending technical limitations in its
tale of a dysfunctional family. In 1999, Harmony
Korine directed the (unofficial) 2nd Dogme picture
(Lars Von Trier's `Idioterne', which was made before,
has yet to have a U.S. release), `julien donkey-boy',
which was panned by critics for accentuating technical
limitations in its analysis of a dysfunctional family.
Now, in 2000, Soren Kragh-Jacobsen has made the 3rd
Dogme film, `Mifune', which has gained a lukewarm
reception for its unconventional story of…you guessed
it; a dysfunctional family. Sounds like a genre to me.</P>
<P>`Mifune' is a pitch-black comedy that takes place in
the Land of the Rising Sun. It begins with the
marriage of Copenhagen businessman Kresten (Anders W.
Berthelsen) to his boss' daughter Claire (Sofie
Grabol). The next morning Kresten finds out that his
estranged father is dead, so he goes to his family's
farm for the funeral. His only living relative is a
developmentally disabled brother named Rud (Jesper
Asholt), who, of course, Kresten is forced to care
for.</P>
<P>Simultaneously, in Copenhagen, a hooker named Liva
(Iben Hjejle) has gotten herself into trouble. When
one of her clients, a principal, informs her that he
recently expelled her brother Bjarke (Emil Tarding),
she beats him over the head and urinates on his rug.
On a whim, she decides to take a housekeeping job at a
farmhouse, which belongs to Kresten and Rud, in order
to get away from her troubles </P>
<P>`Mifune' is the story of these lives at this farm, and
the romance and mayhem that goes on there. On the
surface, `Mifune' is a lot like `Rain Man', in which a
man learns about the important things in life from a
developmentally disabled brother. But Berthelsen and
Asholt aren't Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman, and
`Mifune' is not about their relationship as much as it
is about getting on with your life. </P>
<P>The film takes its title from a game the brothers
play, in which Kresten goes into the cellar and
pretends to fight Toshiro Mifune, star of Akira
Kurosawa's `Seven Samurai', for Rud's enjoyment.
`Happiness is when Mifune comes out of the cellar,'
notes Rud late in the film, and the characters don't
know what he means.</P>
<P>Once it gets going, `Mifune' has many wonderful
moments of inspired humor, but because of the Dogme 95
ban on a background musical score, the all the
emotions must be conveyed by the actors. This is also
the film's main flaw, because the emotional
connections are usually weak. Had `Mifune' been a
straight-up comedy, it might have been more
successful. </P>
<P>In essence, this is a film that showcases what Dogme
95 has to offer, in both positive and negative
fashion. Director Kragh-Jacobsen has followed the
rules down to every detail. The opening and closing
credits are filmed by a video camera scrolling down a
piece of paper, and all phone conversations switch
back and forth to the rooms of the different speakers,
as to not have pre-recorded noise coming out of the
phone. Also, the movie is filmed in digital video, but
is not as choppy or shaky as in `The Celebration' or
`julien donkey-boy'. But `Mifune' is too wild a comedy
to fit smoothly into rules that strive for `purity',
because it is a film about the things in life that we
believe to be impure. </P>
<P>All this talk is not to say that `Mifune', which won
the Silver Bear at Berlin Film Festival and was
Denmark's official entry for this year's Academy
Awards, is not a commendable film. It is a very
entertaining picture; one that derives its laughs from
the silliness of life. But I only wish that future
filmmakers stick to their own vision of purity,
because when following the Dogme rules, you can easily
forget that purity isn't what people look for in a
film. </P>
