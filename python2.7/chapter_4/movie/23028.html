<P>Back in 1996, director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson teamed up
to create the witty and original Scream, a scary movie that simultaneously
derided the cliches of other scary movies. Four years later, a third Scream has
been released, except this time without the wit, originality, or Williamson.
What once was at the top of its class now has become what it was so good at
mocking: a pointless, violent slasher-flick. The surviving members of the first
two films find themselves being stalked again in the middle of Hollywood, where
Stab 3 is being shot, a fictional sequel to the Woodsboro Murders.  But the
question is who's committing the crimes and why?</P>
<P>There is no doubt that Scream 3 is a truly scary film, the numerous scenes in
which the ghost-faced killer stabs his (or her!) innocent victims were all very
intense and well paced. To be honest, this certainly is one of the scariest
movies of the 1990's…but was the aim to just make a scary movie or to prove a
point in the process? Unlike the original Scream, and more like the second
Scream, the movie only completes half of its goal. The humor, ardently
attempted, just does not work (maybe because the previous movies killed off the
funniest characters or maybe because new screenwriter Ehren Kruger just isn't a
funny guy, we will never know). Some potentially clever cameos and a number of
entertainment references were not completely developed and most of the jokes
were just flat-out unfunny. The best part of the film is when Randy (Jamie
Kennedy), who unfortunately does not survive the second film, leaves on
videotape, the rules of a trilogy. This brief ten- minute section only reminds
us how great the first film was at using other movies' clichés to tell its own
jokes. Randy mentions more movies and stereotypes in his small appearance then
the rest of the characters in the whole film combined.  </P>
<P>Another fault in the script is the disastrous last ten minutes, which nearly
ruin the whole movie. I spent the whole time trying to figure out who the
killer was by carefully observing facial expressions and discovering hidden
clues, only to find out that there is absolutely zero evidence and an
unconvincing motive for this random "surprise" of a killer. They could have
picked anyone else and I would have been satisfied, anyone at all.  The
discovery of the person behind the ghost-faced mask also leaves numerous plot
holes that are never answered. Scream 3, supposedly the act in the trilogy that
answers any questions and fixes any mistakes, left me more confused than any of
the past films. </P>
<P>Remember when Scream was about a couple of guys hanging around a video store,
with nothing to do except talk about the movies? It was so simple, yet so
perfect.</P>
