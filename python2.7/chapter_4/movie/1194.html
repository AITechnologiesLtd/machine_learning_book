<PRE>                             THE LAST BOY SCOUT
                       A film review by Mark Santora
                        Copyright 1991 Mark Santora</PRE>
<P>     I saw a preview of this film last Saturday with a sell out crowd.  
Needless to say, the crowd was a little rowdy.  Anyway, the crowd will
not influence this review.</P>
<P>     Well, this film is the latest "buddy" film from writer Shane
Black (of LETHAL WEAPON fame).  Bruce Willis plays an ex-Secret Service
guy who now owns his own private investigators license.  Damon Wayans
plays an ex-football quarterback who was banned from the game for drug
use.   Basically, these two get teamed up when Bruce is put on a case to
watch an exotic dancer who just happens to be Daymon's girlfriend.  She
bites it and then it is off to find the bad guys.  The bad guys are
people who want to legalize sport gambling.  Hence Daymon gets something
to do than act stupid.</P>
<P>     Plot wise the film holds together like all other action films.  No
need to get really specific, but it works.  There is one problem.  The
direction, by Tony Scott is horrible.  Tony Scott's previous work,
including TOP GUN, REVENGE, BEVERLY HILLS COP II, and DAYS OF BLUNDER
(oh, that's THUNDER, isn't it?), all headed towards a dark filmic
style.  Well, here he goes overboard.  It just kills the film.  There
are parts that you want to scream at the screen for the idiot to put a
few lights on so we can see what is going on.  The direction seriously
impairs the film.</P>
<P>      Also, I will take *serious* issue with the opening credits.  I am
about to get technical on you.  The film is shot scope, a ratio of 2.35
to 1.  In other words, it uses the full screen.  However, the opening
credits are shot on a 1.33 to 1 ratio (that's the TV ration folks).  What
does all this mean?  It means that when they go to transfer this to
videotape it will just go along smoothly.  Now some will say that it is
parody off the Monday Night Football song as that is what type of song
Bill Meadly sings.  But they just seemed so cheap.  I felt cheated.
This did not put me in a good mood to start off this film.</P>
<P>     Now, let's not forget character--in a Tony Scott film?  Anyway,
Bruce's wife and kid hate him because he is such a sleaze.  This sets up
nicely for the end of the film reunion with family  giving it a second
try.  And the ending is so-o-o set up for a sequel.</P>
<P>      Michael Kamen did the score.  It reminded me a great deal of his
DIE HARD music.  Okay, there were some really nice parts, but hey, it's
an action flick.  No need for amazing musical treats like Lawrence of
Arabia.  If Michael Kamen decides to do another action flick, I hope he
decides to use some new instruments and refrains.</P>
<P>      Overall, the movie just makes it.  Hampered by the direction and
the somewhat predictable script, it is an okay action flick.  Bruce
Willis should really think about doing that third DIE HARD film, know
what I mean?  Damon Wayans should come out ahead of himself.  He does a
pretty good job with his shallow character.  But Tony Scott has got to
lay off the dark lensing.  It is just too much.  Take a date.  Have a
mindless evening.  Other people will.  Or save your money and see THE
ADDAMS FAMILY, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, and STAR TREK VI.  </P>
