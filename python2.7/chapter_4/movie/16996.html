<P>
 The Wizard of Oz (1939, reissued 1998) 4 stars out of 4. Starring Judy
Garland, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Bert Lahr, Frank Morgan, Margaret Hamilton
and Billie Burke.</P>
<P> A Kansas farmgirl, unhappy with her life, runs away from home, gets caught
in a storm and winds up in a strange land where she is helped by some
friendly, but vertically challenged people and harassed by an older woman
sorely lacking in social skills and suffering from a phobia about houses.</P>
<P> The young girl embarks upon a quest to find her way home. Along the way
she is helped by three kindly strangers, a befuddled individual who
continually falls apart in a crisis; a stout, but cold gentleman who's a
bit rusty at heroics; and a mangy coward whose bark is worse than his bite.</P>
<P> The quartet seek help from a powerful, but mysterious person who may be
able to solve all their problems.</P>
<P> In the end, of course, the four, through many trials and tribulations,
learn themselves about their own true worth and that "there's no place like
home."</P>
<P> What we're referring to, of course, is The Wizard of Oz. And unless you've
been locked in solitary confinment for the past 40-plus years or have been
living with some cult that shuns modern applicances, you know this story as
well as any fairy tale from the Brothers Grimm or Hans Christian Andersen.</P>
<P> For the first time in almost 50 years, you can see one of the most beloved
movies of all time on the big screen, remastered and remixed - that means
the picture and sound have been improved.</P>
<P> The question is, Why should I pay money at the theater to see a movie I
already have on video (or laserdisc)?</P>
<P> The answer is simple: Nothing is as magical as a movie theater when the
lights dim and the opening credits fade in. Sure, you know the story, you
can sing along with the songs, you may even know every word of dialogue.</P>
<P> But seeing Judy Garland at her young and innocent peak on the big screen
before she began that long slide that eventually landed her over the
rainbow for eternity is an experience not to be missed.</P>
<P> On the big screen you will be able to really appreciate the sets and
costumes, and especially that wonderful moment when Dorothy steps from her
drab black-and-white world into the Technicolor splendor of the wonderful
land of Oz.</P>
<P> Seeing The Wizard of Oz in a movie theater, the way God and Louis B. Mayer
intended you to see it, is like being at Cape Canaveral for a space shuttle
launch instead of watching it on television.</P>
<P> It's an emotional, once-in-a-lifetime event that you will later regret you
missed.</P>
