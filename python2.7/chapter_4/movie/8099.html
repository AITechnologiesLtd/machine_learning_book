<PRE>My Best Friend's Wedding</PRE>
<P>This being my first ever written movie review, I thought it would be
appropriate that I start of with a review that gave me the greatest
theatrical enjoyment in my favorite genre of films this year. Please
feel free to comment on my style of critique; whether or not you think
Siskel and Ebert should be sacrificed in my honor or if you feel that
you should get a new phone cord for ever letting such a vile piece of
literature flow through your modem. Enjoy ;)</P>
<P>This movie caught my attention from the first time I saw the trailer.
Why? Anyone who's ever seen a few romantic comedies will at one point
or another talk about a point in a movie that either touched them
deeply, could really relate to, or have been through a similar
experience and was the cause for loving or hating the movie. On an
admittedly personal note, "My Best Friend's Wedding" did the exactly
that for me; and that was just the trailer. Having seen the trailer a
few more times, plus viewing some commercial, and seeing Julia Roberts
back in the type of part that made her famous, plus seeing who was in
the cast, I had high expectations for the movie.</P>
<PRE>I was not disappointed.</PRE>
<P>The opening credit features a silly-but-cute-so-therefore-enjoyable
choreograph of dancing a bride and bridesmaids. They're dressed in the
picture- wedding attire but dance around with a rather mischievous look
on each of their faces. The movie itself starts off with the Julianne
Potter (played by a glowing Julia Roberts) doing what she does for a
living, reviewing restaurants. It is there she tells her friend George
(lovable lug Rupert Everett) about her best friend Michael, who has
left a phone call sounding "desperate" telling Jules "we have to talk".
Apparently they shared a brief but heated relationship which ended with
him making Julianne commit to a pact that should they still be unwed by
the time they reach 28, they'll marry each other. And they've been the
best of friends ever since. George points out to Julianne, whom
everyone calls "Jules", that she'll be turning 28 in 3 weeks.</P>
<P>Apparently Jules has a problem with dating in that her view of
relationships is akin to that of an attention-deficient child during a
math lecture. She has better luck keeping guys around as just friends,
and as her claims with Michael, even best friends. She doesn't realize
until he's unavailable that she granted her belief that Michael had
always have a romantic interest in her. Jules finds out about his
engagement after finally talking to him on the phone and while the
whole time assuming he wants to propose, he drops a revelation that
literally knocks her off her feet. Now she has four days to "break up
the wedding, steal the groom", and she has no idea how. By the books
this movie is not.</P>
<P>The focus of Jules' obsession is sportswriter/best friend Michael
O'Neal (expertly played by the handsome Dermont Mulrony). The fiancee
is the sweet, young Kimmy Wallace play by Cameron Diaz who
incidentally, improves her acting abilities with every role and is
hereleaps-and- bounds beyond anything she's done before. More on that
later.</P>
<P>Though Julia Roberts is the star of the movie, her co-stars are
affectively an integral part of the movie. Scene stealer Rupert Everett
is at his best when he flies to Chicago to comfort the self-pitying
Jules and unwillingly becomes her new fiancee. His attempts at being a
gay man who embarrasses Jules by playing her testosterony-yet-loveable
fiancee flying over for a "pre-conjugal" visit are both effective and
hilarious. Comic mayhem ensues during a meal at a seafood restaurant
where he turns the movie into a mini-musical by leading the family and
eventually the entire restaurant in a lively rendition of "I Say a
Little Prayer".</P>
<P>Credit also goes to Rachel Griffiths and Carrie Preston who play
Samantha and Amanda, Kimmy's two perky, nymphomaniacal bridesmaids.
Their parts are brief but the screen time they share are funny. the
funniest being a scene of an ice sculpture shown in a manner not quite
scene before.</P>
<P>Hats off to Aussie P.J. hogan who does an effective job of keeping the
film lively and entertaining even at parts where it starts to run a
little thin. His willingness to try the unconventional and an uncanny
ability to filter out needless sentiment keeps the movie gleeful and
enjoyably lacking in pretense.</P>
<P>Mulroney is effective if boring as the nice but confused groom to be.
Diaz throws her body and soul into her role as the rich but unspoiled
and highly energetic bride. Keep an eye on her face, not because it's
nice to look at (well, ok that too), but her newfound acting skills
allows her to act in some parts without saying a word. The perfect
example is where Jules takes Michael and Kimmy to a karaoke club, know
quite well that Kimmy is frightened to death of karaoke. Diaz's
expressions of fear is evident from the moment she first walks in and
you can't help but feel sorry for her while at the same time think Jules
as incredibly mean for putting her up to this. I found myself almost
singing along as if trying to help her get through the song and though
most people won't get drawn quite this way, most will be rooting for her
to do well. Diaz is here head and shoulders above her lacking
performance in "She's the One" and anything else she's done.</P>
<P>One thing lacking where you'd except to find is chemistry between the
two main stars. Mulroney and Roberts is believable as best friends, but
the chemistry between him and Diaz is lukewarm at best. Here again
Everett steals the movie by meshing well with Roberts as the friend
trying to help a friend in need and also a sane voice of reason to
Robert's mild "psychotic jealousy". Even the scenes where the two of
them converse over the phone involve lively and meaningful dialogue.</P>
<P>I've heard critics say the movie isn't worth watching due to their
inability to believe that a boy and a girl can still be best friends
after a breakup or that the pact in itself was preposterous. As the
voice of experience, I can say with confidence that it can happen. This
isn't the first movie involving a pact between two friends. "If Lucy
Fell" if you remember (you probably won't) involved a couple saying that
if both of them were still single when they turned 30, they'd jump off
the Brooklyn Bridge. "My Best Friend's Wedding" succeeds where "Lucy"
fell (pun intended), least of which the terms of the pact is not nearly
as morbid. "Wedding" has a lot going for it with Hogan's expert
directing, Robert's bright smile returning to form in what his probably
her best type of role, and the believable and entertaining performance
of her costars. At the end of the movie, Jules won't be the 
only with an ear-to-ear grin.</P>
