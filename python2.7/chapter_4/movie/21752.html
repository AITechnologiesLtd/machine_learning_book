<P>Sleepy Hollow and Dogma are two very different films dealing with death. 
Dogma is most effective because of its hilariously dark comedy and 
ensemble cast. Sleepy Hollow finds its success in a classic horror 
story, grizzly images and two remarkable performances. Both stand out as 
solid works with minimal faults and can consequently expect mid-range 
box office.</P>
<P>Dogma's Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) are angels famous 
for Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and several other acts of skilled 
labor. However, they have been ejected from heaven because of their sins 
on earth (not mass-murder, but quibbling with the Lord, consuming liquor 
and assorted others). They discover a loophole that may allow them back 
"home" when Cardinal Glick (George Carlin) decides to rededicate a New 
Jersey church as part of a newer, hipper Christianity called Catholicism 
Wow! (no mention of olestra is made). They fail to realize that their 
returning to heaven could trigger a small side affect: the end of all 
existence.</P>
<P>Sleepy Hollow's Headless Horseman (Christopher Walken in a deliciously 
chilling yet relatively small performance) is rejected from his grave 
because his head was severed from his body with his own sword and stolen 
shortly thereafter. He decapitates his victims and takes their heads to 
use in place of his own.</P>
<P>Dogma was condemned by The Church early on and consequently changed 
studios a few times before finally settling in at Lion's Gate. 
Director Kevin Smith makes light of this in his opening disclaimer which 
describes itself as "a statement made to save one's own ass" and 
includes a few below-the-belt shots at Disney, the original studio. 
Those without a sense of humor may have trouble dealing with a 
mass-shooting of company executives who make golden calves, a muse who 
strips for money because of writer's block and a pop singer, Alanis 
Morisette, playing the Big Guy (Gal?) in the sky.</P>
<P>Sleepy Hollow is a time revered horror story that has only been slightly 
modified for the film. Much of the light-fright is dependant on a 1799 
setting which provides candle-lit rooms, no automobiles and strong 
gothic elements.</P>
<P>The killing sprees in both films are highlighted by grizzly images and 
excessive amounts of blood. Whether a mass-slaughter at church or 
head-spitting tree is more disturbing, I leave up to you.</P>
<P>Washington Irving's classic tale, directed by horror master Tim 
Burton, is complemented by two key performances from Johnny Depp and 
Christina Ricci as Ichabod Crane and Katrina Van Tassel respectively. 
For Depp this is another dark role in the tradition of his title 
character in Edward Scissorhands and role in Nightmare on Elm Street. 
For Ricci this is an amalgamation of her career to date and testament to 
that fact that she is one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood. 
The similarities to her classic portrayal of Wednesday Adams are 
obvious, but a closer look reveals that her character's love affair 
with Crane soon after her boyfriend's death show similarities to her 
role as Dee-Dee in The Opposite of Sex. The darker and more frightful 
elements can be compared to her part in the star-studded independent 
film Hurlyburly.</P>
<P>Dogma's cast is as endowed as Ricci's Hurlyburly. Affleck and Damon 
team up for the first time since their award winning Good Will Hunting. 
Other than the persistent use of the "F-word," the two films have little 
in common, showing how versatile the couple can be. George Carlin, a 
dignified legend in the world of stand-up comedy, gives a performance as 
funny as Walken's is frightful and equally sized (leading you to 
wonder how he got billing over Matt Damon, the film's co-star). Linda 
Florentino (of Men in Black fame) plays Bethany, the film's heroine 
who is sent to stop the rejected angels from entering the New Jersey 
church. She is a pleasure to watch and seems to be establishing herself 
as a solid actress. Other delights include Chris Rock reprising his 
traditional "'cause I'm black!" role, Selma Hayek as a much better 
muse than Sharon Stone, and the film's director, Kevin Smith, as 
Silent Bob the unknowing prophet.</P>
<P>Both films have faults, albeit minor ones. Dogma's audience is too 
busy laughing to put aside time for some meaningful and serious scenes 
towards the end. Sleepy Hollow has trouble developing its characters 
early and consequently you aren't sure of some victims' identity. 
But these are small flaws and in today's Hollywood both Dogma and 
Sleepy Hollow stand out as being well above average.</P>
