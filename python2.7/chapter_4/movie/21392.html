<PRE>"Double Jeopardy" Review
by Fontaine Lien
WARNING: CONTAINS PLOT SPOILERS</PRE>
<P>That is, unless you're one of those people who have seen the preview a
thousand times on TV or in the theaters.  I can tell you one thing
now: they gave the entire movie away.  Why someone would want to base
an entire movie on one premise and then give that crucial detail away
in the trailers is beyond me.  However, if they *hadn't* given it
away, the film would've still been suprisingly devoid of suspense
given its subject matter.  Obviously, the producers thought they could
remake "The Deep End of the Ocean," throw in Tommy Lee Jones and a
couple of cliches and call it an action drama.</P>
<P>"Double Jeopardy" offers solid acting from Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee
Jones, who got first billing even though he didn't see to be on screen
half as much as Judd did.  It also offers some genuinely funny,
clever, or full-of-tension moments (my favorite: Judd waking up in the
coffin), but none of that can salvage the film from its insanely
predictable plot.  Half the time I'm wondering whether I'm watching
one of those overhyped TV miniseries, which always turn out to be less
exciting than advertised.  Judging by the beginning, end, and a huge
chunk of the middle, I might have been watching a special Hallmark
presentation too.  The movie's stretching for an almost two hour long
film with only 30 minutes worth of material.  Implausible material, no
less.  Loose interpretation of one of the amendments aside, too many
times in the movie I thought, "That is *not* possible*." That kind of
stuff is excusable in popcorn movies, but not one like "Double
Jeopardy" that tries to pass itself off as serious drama.  Everything
seems dragged out, overplayed.  When they should've kept us in the
dark, they let the cat out of the bag too early.</P>
<PRE>Sorry Alex, next category please.</PRE>
