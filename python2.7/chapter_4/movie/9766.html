<P>Oh how I wish I could have seen Kevin Jarre and Chuck Pfarrer work out
the screenplay for THE JACKAL.  They must have read the novel, or even
worse, just watched the previous film version, and then thought,
"Let's focus most of the film on THE JACKAL!"  I haven't read the
book, but I know that it must have been better than this.  THE JACKAL,
which ripped its premise from a 1973 production of THE DAY OF THE
JACKAL, is a film which wants to try something new, to show us the
criminal's mind work as he sets up for his next target.  However, we
have seen it before, and done much better (IN THE LINE OF FIRE).
Unfortunately, the film focuses so much attention on The Jackal (Bruce
Willis) that we begin to care for him more than the good guys.  I must
admit that I did like one of the heros, but she is left with a smaller
part than all the male characters in the film.</P>
<P>THE JACKAL opens promisingly, with a title sequence similar to that of
SEVEN.  In the background, we see some historical war scenes composed
of poorly edited television broadcasts.  The music, by Carter Burwell
(FARGO, and others), is moody and well done.  But once actors start
appearing on screen, THE JACKAL doesn't just slow to crawl... it comes
to a halt.  A glimmer of hope shines when Sidney Poitier arrives, but
left with a small scrap of a role, that glimmer is snuffed out.
Opening with a scene which is quickly forgotten, Valentina Koslova
(Diane Venora, HEAT) and FBI Deputy Director Carter Preston (Poitier)
try to arrest a Russian terrorist (I assume, as they never quite tell
us).  The Russian terrorist ends up dead, and as cliched as it might
be, his brother wants revenge.</P>
<P>The brother hires The Jackal to show America something they would
never forget.  The Jackal is assigned, with a $70 million price tag,
to assassinate a high-ranking U.S. Government official.  Who is it
exactly?  We aren't sure, and we don't find out until late in the
film.  This is supposedly added for suspenseful purposes, but instead,
with the recent discoveries surrounding the certain official nowadays,
we wish The Jackal would succeed and kill the official.  But listening
to the audience's reaction, I guess most people will find this movie
entertaining and fun.  Well, it is fun, for a little while, and only
at the end.  So why has this big name cast signed on for this film?
I'm not quite sure, with the exception of Bruce Willis who must have
thought it would be fun to portray a bad guy.  Luckily, Willis has so
much fun that we begin to get involved in the film--but only with his
character.</P>
<P>THE JACKAL follows two different story lines, trying to draw an
indistinct line between them.  We are forced into watching a
cat-and-mouse game, except from both sides.  We see The Jackal setting
up his project, and we also see Carter Preston trying to find The
Jackal.  My question is, how did Mr. Preston know The Jackal was
planning something?  Maybe they explained it to us, but if they did, I
was probably trying to make sense of what occured just prior to that
scene.  Here is a movie which plays out with all the information
exposed to the audience (with the exception of who is being targeted),
while the characters are left in the dark for most of the film.
Despite this, and ironically so, THE JACKAL remains one step ahead of
us, making us think back, trying to clear up holes and messy dialogue
from previous scenes.  A lot of the dialogue is spoken with Russian or
other accents, and we can't quite tell what is being said.  Many of
these lines come from Richard Gere, who has an extremely distracting
Irish accent.  His lines come across as a slur of words, and the
audience is left struggling to make sense of it.  Gere does manage to
get most of his lines across well, but some of the important ones are
said so quietly, we can't distinguish them.  Thankfully, Gere doesn't
show up until the movie's setup has been completed (but we are still
confused).</P>
<P>As the antagonist, Bruce Willis shows a terrific side to his acting
talent.  We have seen him play good guys in the DIE HARD series and
TWELVE MONKEYS, but we have never quite seen him as sadistic as this.
I found his performance to be hugely entertaining, and whenever the
movie went back to the chase side, I was disappointed.  Now, I'm not
saying I like rooting for the bad guys, but when there are no good
guys to cheer for, who else is there?  Furthermore, The Jackal
reminded me of Val Kilmer's character in THE SAINT (which was actually
worse than this film).  His character kept changing appearances,
showing Willis' wide range of acting skill.  As mentioned previously,
I wish they could have found a better target for the film, because I
had no emotional connection to the target themselves.  Another reason
for this is the physical resemblance of the two officials (in the film
and in real life).  Willis' suave style gives a lot of depth to his
good character, and therefore gives the most respectable performance.</P>
<P>The only hero I was actually rooting for was Major Koslova (Venora).
Her no-nonsense attitude is something most of the male figures needed
in the film.  Remarkably, the acting isn't the worst thing in the
film.  The plot is, which is rather disgraceful to the premise.
Setting up a premise with this much hope is one thing, but to shoot it
down in the next hour and fourty-five minutes is another.  I can't
recall another film in which I have actually noticed most of the plot
holes while watching the movie.  Usually I will discover them while
thinking about it afterwards (and usually I will forgive the film for
these if it was entertaining enough), but these were too obvious to
not notice, and the film wasn't very entertaining.  How did The Jackal
get the gun off of the boat?  How did the protagonist find Declan
Mulqueen (Gere)?  Despite all these questions, the more obvious
questions relate to the characters themselves.  Who was the Russian
terrorist?  Who was his brother?  What purpose did the homosexual have
in the movie?  Who were those hijackers?  All questions, with little
answers.</P>
<P>Director Michael Caton-Jones has given us a very slow-paced action
film, with little depth to pull us in.  Jones admirably left a lot of
blood out of the film, which so many action films like to show us.
Normally I like to see the violence, but I have realized, with this
film, that a lot of it isn't necessary to witness.  That isn't saying
there isn't blood and gore, but it is a heck of a lot less than say,
STARSHIP TROOPERS or THE PEACEMAKER.  Unfortunately, Jones never finds
the right tone or pace for the film to move along.  We are left
wanting more... of anything, in fact.  More violence could have even
helped.  More action would have been nice.  Even though this is a
suspense/action film, put more coherent action scenes in.  It's hard
to believe that this is the director who gave us that beautifully
orchestrated sword fight in ROB ROY.</P>
<P>THE JACKAL is rated R for strong violence and language.  In fact, the
language was extremely disturbing from the very start.  Normally
language doesn't disturb me in a film, but THE JACKAL's constant use
of it in the first ten minutes caught me off guard.  Perhaps the
reason I was disturbed is because I didn't know who the guy was, or
what he had done wrong.  Overall, I would say that THE JACKAL fails in
most areas.  It does have a few elements of fun, but mostly because of
Willis.  Not many actors can portray evil while portraying a sensitive
side.  However, I still tend to wonder why he hesitated in killing the
woman.  Sensitive?  Oh yeah, kinda gets you right there, doesn't it?</P>
