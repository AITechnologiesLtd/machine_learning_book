<PRE>Rating: ***1/2 (out of five)</PRE>
<P>Written and directed by Anthony Waller.  
Starring Marina Zudina.  
Special cameo by Alec Guinness.  
Rated R (contains brutal violence, nudity, and profanity)  90 mins.  </P>
<P>Synopsis:  An attractive mute makeup artist, working on an ultra-cheesy
slasher movie in Moscow, witnesses the production of a brutal snuff film and
is subsequently chased by really bad Russians.  Meanwhile, the artist's
sister and boyfriend clumsily try to save her.  </P>
<P>Comments:  MUTE WITNESS came as a surprise to me the first time I watched
it.  Drawn by the clever artwork on the video box, I rented the film
expecting a complete turkey.  MUTE WITNESS, however, was original, offbeat,
and well-made.  It's one of those cool little finds that no one seems to
know about.  I've subsequently found it at most video rental places I visit,
and it may be seen, on occasion, on the Independent Film Channel.  </P>
<P>The first hour of MUTE WITNESS is extremely tense, as Billy, the quite
believable mute heroine, sees members of the Russian mob brutally kill a
prostitute while filming an illegal snuff film.  The rest of the film takes
good advantage of Billy's vulnerable position as a mute foreigner in Moscow
being pursued by powerful criminal figures.  To throw a curveball into the
fray, Billy's sister Karen and her filmmaking beau become bizarre figures of
comic relief to offset several violent sequences in what are some genuinely
funny scenes.  </P>
<P>A disappointingly trite ending and occasional comic blunders are the only
two things which mar this otherwise suspenseful film.  Look for Alec
Guinness (Obi-Wan Kenobi from the first STAR WARS trilogy) in a small role
as the evil Reaper.  Definately check this movie out; although, as a word of
warning, it does contain several scenes of rather grisly violence which
certainly aren't for the squeamish.  </P>
