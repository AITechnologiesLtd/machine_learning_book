<PRE>Without Limits (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>    Reviewed by Greg Nowak</PRE>
<P>        Director: Robert Towne Cast: Billy Crudup as Steve Prefontaine,
Donald Sutherland as Bill Bowerman (aka Nike Shoes co-founder), Monica
Potter as Mary Marckx. Written by Robert Towne and Kenny. Out of 5
stars: ***1/2 (3-1/2)</P>
<P>        There was a huge crowd - at a premiere screening of "Without
Limits" (first screening with a major general audience admittance). This
was a movie premiere at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. I
must say that I met the director there so this could be a more slanted
review.</P>
<P>        Have you ever been on a European Bullet train. I just got back
from Europe, riding around 5 times to various cities. You get on and
can't believe the speed. You start conversing; being distracted as the
outside rushes by you. Then you turn back to the excitement of speed.</P>
<P>        You look out the window searching for a reference of speed.
Automobiles on the Autobahn that you pass show you how fast you are
going. Steve Prefontaine was so much of a gift or had that gift. The
movie of his life is like that feeling on the train; what's he compared
to. The story inside him needs an artist and Robert Towne paints the
intensity of a runner, "Pre" "Without Limits". Pre is without limits,
except for the honest distractions of the humorously laid-back but
dabbling attitude of his coach, Bowerman and the great allure of Pre's
female attraction.</P>
<P>        Sutherland is at his best (you know his great acting like in
Ordinary People (1980) that won 4 Oscars). and Billy Crudup fine
performance reminds you of those college days of recklessness and long
hair.</P>
<P>        Why should you see this movie? It's a tragedy that takes you
back to the late 70's; why you love to do sports ("Just do It"); and why
you really do what in the rest of your life (testosterone). Also you
escape to green pastures, smelling the newly cut grass and college days
with a coach or teacher you don't like but like now.</P>
