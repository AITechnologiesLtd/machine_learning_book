<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A French-American produced offbeat crime thriller set in Los Angeles, with
English dialogue. Jean-Louis Tritignant is Lucien, a hit man from Paris who goes
to Los Angeles to eliminate a wealthy crime boss, Victor Kovacs (Ted de Corsia).
He does a thoroughly professional job, as he enters his Beverly Hills mansion
posing as his foreign lawyer and executes him in the living room while his
gorgeous wife Jackie (Angie Dickinson) and wormy son Alec (Orsini) were swimming
in the pool. Alec now takes over as crime boss and also takes up with Jackie.
They will give a misleading description of the hit man, when questioned by the
police. </P>
<P>When Lucien returns to his hotel, he is baffled to learn that someone checked
him out and stole his passport. When he tries to drive away, contract killer
Lenny (Roy Scheider) tries to shoot him. </P>
<P>The story might be slight, but the acting by Tritignant is just right and the
action scenes keep coming and are perfectly executed. Scheider also stands out
in a supporting role. </P>
<P>With Lucien stuck in a foreign country and limited in his English, it is
interesting to see how he tries to figure out what happened and how to get back
to Paris. He carjacks a dumb housewife coming out of a shopping mall, Mrs Barnes
(Georgia), and forces her to take him to her apartment where she cooks a meal
for him and he calls the people in Paris who arranged the hit. Taking her car
when he leaves to go downtown to a strip club and meet the one his friends told
him could help, he's pursued by Lenny. In the shootout, Lucien's hitchhiker, a
Jesus freak, is killed. </P>
<P>Meeting his contact, Nancy (Ann-Margret), who features a plunging neckline
exposing her best assets, he learns that she hates the Kovac men because they
put her out of the ownership end of the strip club business and reduced her to
being a worker. She's the ex-lover of his Paris connection Antoine
(Constantine), and will reluctantly hook him up with cab driver Karl (Carlo De
Mejo) to get him a phony passport. But, Lenny makes his stay in L.A. a difficult
one, as he tries to get him a few more times. Their shootouts are what gives
this film a life of its own, as they are well choreographed and take place in
unusual spots (such as the one in Venice Beach). Nancy and Lucien stay together
and form some kind of semi-romantic relationship but, unfortunately, with no
steam coming out of them. This flick is all about shootouts and quirky character
portrayals, like the one of the housewife talking nonstop to the press about her
ordeal and eating up the fact that she's on TV. </P>
<P>The best shootout comes in the climax between Alec's bodyguards and Lucien's
men, as it takes place by Victor's bier. He's in the chapel room embalmed in a
sitting position on the funeral parlor's throne while holding a cigar, as Lucien
figures out that Alec is not an ethical crime boss and has double-crossed him.
He now gets the last shot and laugh. </P>
