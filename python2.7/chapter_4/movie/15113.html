THE SIEGE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Life has been like a horror movie lately for FBI agent Anthony 'Hub'
Hubbard (Denzel Washington) in THE SIEGE. Just when he thinks he's
killed the last terrorist monster, another one rises up to smite the
city.</P>
<P>"New York City brought to its knees" the television news wails as retail
sales plummet 72%.</P>
<P>"This is New York City," Hub blusters with inner doubts showing all over
his troubled brow. "We can take it."</P>
<PRE>Maybe not.</PRE>
<P>As most of his schemes prove sadly ineffectual, Hub goes from cockily
confident to completely overwhelmed to intensely angry as the carnage
mounts in the worst series of terrorist attacks in our nation's history.</P>
<P>THE SIEGE, a riveting tale of terror, is by director Edward Zwick, who
worked with Denzel Washington previously on the mesmerizing COURAGE
UNDER FIRE and GLORY. Beautifully edited for maximum tension by Steven
Rosenblum, the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat. Zwick knows how
to time and stage scenes to keep the audience on constant alert. Even
when they know something will happen, as in the bus bombing, Zwick
manages to time it in a quite surprising way.</P>
<P>The complex thriller involves warring federal agencies, all trying to
control the chaos caused by multiple terrorist cells at work in New York
City. Hub leads the FBI team, but he comes up against Elise Kraft
(Annette Bening), a tough veteran of the CIA's covert activities against
Saddam Hussein. The negative chemistry between the two of them and later
between them and a self-righteous General William Devereaux (Bruce
Willis) form one of the most interesting of the story's subplots. Hub is
never happier than when he and his guys get to draw their guns on the
CIA, operating illegally in this country, and on the megalomaniac
general.</P>
<P>Hub tries hard to uphold the laws while Elise, trained in covert
activities, wants to do absolutely anything to stop the terrorists. He
complains that she doesn't know the difference between right and wrong.
"It is easy to tell the difference between right and wrong," Elise tells
Hub. "What is difficult is finding the wrong that's more right."</P>
<P>Denzel Washington delivers another of the richly intelligent
performances that he can do so well. Bruce Willis plays Bruce Willis.
But it is Annette Bening, who steals the picture with her best dramatic
performance ever.</P>
<P>"These guys are the real deal," Elise warns Hub about the terrorists
early in the picture. It is not until much later that he fully
comprehends what she meant. Bening's precise and delicately emotive
portrayal of a woman who reveals as little as possible about herself
makes for a fascinating enigma.</P>
<P>As a frantic Hub tries to talk to the bomb-laden terrorists holding up a
city bus full of passengers, the prescient Elise sizes up the
terrorist's real motivation. "They're not here to negotiate," she warns
Hub. "They're waiting for the cameras."</P>
<P>BIG NIGHT's Tony Shalhoub is excellent as Frank Haddad, an Arab-American
FBI agent, who is Hub's right-hand man. The story's respect for Frank
and his family somewhat counterbalances the story's controversial
subject matter, the treatment of the Arab-American population.</P>
<P>As the slaughter of innocent Americans mounts, the pressure builds to
turn to the military as the savior of last resort, but General Devereaux
argues strongly against this tactic. When the country reaches its limit,
the president invokes the War Powers Act.</P>
<P>General Devereaux soon has tanks rolling across the Brooklyn Bridge, and
he orders his men to go house to house rounding up Arab suspects and
putting them into concentration camps. "This is the land of opportunity
gentlemen," the general confidently tells the terrorists via television.
"The opportunity to turn yourselves in."</P>
<P>It is in this section that the movie is most in danger of losing its
audience. The film touches on issues of discrimination that will likely
prove uncomfortable for many viewers. Discrimination is like that, it is
something easier to ignore than ponder.</P>
<P>The movie makes judicious use of comedy to break the tension as in
Frank's microwave envy. It seems that spooks have some really nifty
microwave equipment that allows them to eavesdrop on conversations and
more, but the FBI has never been able to get its hands on the
technology. The film's running joke has Frank constantly coveting it.
The movie is even able to get a laugh out of Hub's humor-challenged
management style.</P>
<P>Any movie about terrorist bombings that contains relatively few
explosions, as THE SIEGE does, deserves a special award for its lack of
pyrotechnic overkill. Most directors of action films, even dramatic
thrillers, seem to have their pay based on an incentive scheme directly
linked to the noise level and number of explosions. Zwick creates his
tension the old-fashion way -- with actors actually acting. This can
best be seen in the film's carefully choreographed conclusion. It is
masterful more for what it doesn't contain than what it does.</P>
<P>THE SIEGE runs 2:00. It is rated R for violence, language, and brief
nudity and would be fine for most teenagers.</P>
