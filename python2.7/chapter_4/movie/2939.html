<PRE>                                HOOP DREAMS
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  Surprisingly engaging documentary
     that follows two promising inner-city basketball players
     from high school recruiting to freshman year at college.
     The story is surprising both in its completeness and the
     dramatic power it has, considering it is not a script
     that could be planned in advance.  Rating: +2 (-4 to
     +4).</P>
<P>     How does a documentary film like this get made?  If a director
has a script in front of him, he can be fairly certain that there will
be some measure of drama coming out of the film he is shooting.  A
documentary about the Third Reich has got to give its director the
relative security of being able to scan all the materials and assure
himself that there is a story worth telling.  But how did producers
Fred Marx, Steve James, and Peter Gilbert know that if they started
filming two promising junior-high-school level basketball players for
four or five years that at the end of the time they would have a film
with the dramatic impact of HOOP DREAMS?  This is a documentary that
sustains interest for its entire 174-minute length.</P>
<P>     The film follows the high school careers of William Gates and
Arthur Agee, two black Chicago boys, promising hoopsters, drafted by
St.  Joseph's, a suburban Catholic high school that has a strong
emphasis on basketball.  They are in the same program that developed
star player Isiah Thomas.  Both boys have learned to spell success
"NBA."  William comes to St. Joseph's on full scholarship, paid by a
patron who holds a high position at the Encyclopedia Britannica.
Arthur is not so lucky; he is on half scholarship with his family
paying the balance.  This difference will prove to have far-reaching
effects on Arthur's high school basketball.  Arthur's father becomes a
crack addict, turns to crime, and is sent to prison. The Agees are
unable to pay the school's tuition and Arthur is thrown out and must go
instead to Marshall, a local all-black school.  Despondent over family
problems, Arthur has a very poor sophomore year while William prospers
only to be brought low by a knee injury.  The camera follows the story
of the two players and the pressures to win that they face.  Without a
word of commentary the film stingingly indicts high schools and
colleges that treat athletes like commodities.  High schools programs
treat athletes as if winning were everything; colleges treat them as if
money is everything and winning is the way to get it.</P>
<P>     250 hours of film were shot to provide the filmmakers with enough
material to tell a complete and detailed story. Even so, one is often
surprised that the camera was present and filming at what are often
very personal moments.  We get a good deal more of both the Agee and
Gates families than one would ever expect they would agree to.  There
are surprisinglyly unflattering portraits of people like Gene
Pingatore, the St. Joseph's basketball coach, and recruiters from
schools like Marquette.</P>
<P>     You do not have to be a basketball fan to find this a remarkable
documentary about much more in American life than basketball.  I myself
have no interest in the game and I give the film a +2 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
