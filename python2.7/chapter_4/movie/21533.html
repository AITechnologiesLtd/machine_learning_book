<P>     In most exceptional films, there is a moment early on when you can
just tell you're tapped into something special. That moment in THE
STRAIGHT STORY comes as Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth), a 73-year-old
widower with failing eyesight and failing hips, begins the true-story trek
at the center of the film. Having recently learned that his estranged
brother Lyle has had a stroke, Alvin decides it's time to make amends. He
sets out from his home in Laurens, Iowa to Lyle's home in Mt. Zion,
Wisconsin on the only transportation at his disposal: a riding lawnmower.
As Alvin hits the two-lane highway, director David Lynch slowly pans up
from Alvin to the cloud-filled sky above the Iowa fields. He holds that
shot for what seems like a full minute, then slowly pans back down...  
where we see Alvin's puttering rig about 100 yards from where we last saw
it.</P>
<P>     I think that shot might have been one of the best of the year even if
its only purpose had been as a shaggy dog joke. But it's more than that;
it's a remarkably efficient tone-setter. Instantly, you know this is going
to be a rather unique travelogue. You can begin to appreciate the truly
inspired combination of Freddie Francis's cinematography and Angelo
Badalamenti's fiddle-and-guitar road music that makes THE STRAIGHT STORY
so evocative in its heartland sincerity. And you understand that slow,
methodical persistence is central to this story's success -- not just in
Alvin's journey, but in Lynch's willingness to ask his audience for some
patience as the film unfolds.</P>
<P>     If you're busy rubbing your eyes incredulously, wondering if we could
possibly be talking about the same David Lynch who made "Twin Peaks," BLUE
VELVET and LOST HIGHWAY, let me assure you that we are. We're also talking
about the same David Lynch who made THE ELEPHANT MAN, another fact-based
story overflowing with compassion and humanity. There may be something
about working from real life that keeps Lynch anchored, and it's a style
that suits him well. As provocative as his more surreal films have been,
they can make it difficult to appreciate what a talented director he is
between the cringes and the head-scratching. In THE STRAIGHT STORY, he is
more in command of his simple visual storytelling than he has ever been,
which is not necessarily saying that THE STRAIGHT STORY is his best film.
It's simply obvious, with none of the grotesquerie characteristic of other
Lynch films, that he knows exactly what works for any given story.</P>
<P>     He also knows that THE STRAIGHT STORY is more than a bunch of pretty
pictures of the American midwest. Richard Farnsworth's performance is so
low-key and naturalistic that it may not seem there's a lot going on, but
Alvin Straight is a superbly crafted character. Senior citizens rarely get
the kind of showcase THE STRAIGHT STORY provides, and Farnsworth does
beautiful things with Alvin. It's always clear that he's a stubborn man,
but it becomes clear that he's also a man trying to make the wisdom of his
years mean something. His journey to reconcile with Lyle becomes a chance
to show he's learned what matters, and that difficult moments in life can
be overcome by one selfless act. If you're unmoved by Lyle's (Harry Dean
Stanton) silent realization of what Alvin has done for him, then movies
may hold no power to move you.</P>
<P>     It's true that Alvin's homespun homilies -- to a teenage runaway he 
encounters; to young cyclists; to the feuding twins who fix his lawnmower
-- do drag THE STRAIGHT STORY down a bit. Farnsworth does a fine job of
pulling all possible sanctimony out of those scenes, but the film is still
stronger when it's quiet and observant, soaring on the skills of Francis
and Badalamenti. There's also a sly sense of humor to THE STRAIGHT STORY,
including Lynch's ability to poke fun at himself. In a very early scene,
he trains his camera on a front yard, where a heavy-set woman lies tanning
herself. It's exactly the kind of scene where Lynch might have dipped into
the creatures beneath the green lawn, or found some other bit of suburban
horror. In THE STRIAGHT STORY, he just tells a straight story, finding
poetry in the simple reliability of a lawnmower's slow, steady journey.</P>
