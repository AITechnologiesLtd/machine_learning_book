<PRE>                                    APOLLO 13
                       A film review by Melissa Martin
                        Copyright 1995 Melissa Martin</PRE>
<PRE>Starring Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Kevin Bacon, Ed Harris, Bill Paxton
Directed by Ron Howard
Universal </PRE>
<P>     There is a scene in the beginning of APOLLO 13 where the
astronauts of the disastrous Apollo 1 mission are boarding the ship.
During this short orientation sequence, I was awed, then gripped by
suspense, and then moved to tears by tragedy.  Not only does the whole
movie play like this, it also adds appropriate amounts of humor,
wisdom, and humanity.</P>
<P>     The script is amazingly written.  Facing the obvious difficulties
of writing an entire story around technical jargon, the writers did a
stunning job of making all the NASA lingo seem somehow completely
intelligible.  I was never lost for a second: indeed, as I walked out
of the theatre, I was using most of the space-speak that they used in
the film.  Also difficult to pull off is a story that deals with one
problem after another: in other movies with this type of anticlimatic
flow, the audience often becomes bored.  But this movie keeps you
riveted with one suspense-filled climax after another.  After every
problem has been faced and solved, there is a lot of remaining tension
that stops one from getting back into the flow of the movie.  However,
this was cleverly avoided by adding moments of whimsy, and some very
humorous scenes that relieve the tension, so that you can be on the
edge of your seat again when the next problem comes up.  This movie
can, at times, be extremely funny and delightful: this is well
countered by the true thriller nature.</P>
<P>     The story, guided by the tremendous directing talent of Ron
Howard, becomes a touching story of humanity alone against the two
greatest unknowns: death and the universe.  The movie, while being an
intelligent and well thought out thriller, also becomes a sentimental
film about the limits of human ability ... and the ultimate human
triumph.</P>
<P>     Not one actor in the superb cast gives a mediocre performance.
Tom Hanks is on the Oscar road again with his performance as Cmdr. Jim
Lovell.  This is Hanks at his versatile best.  Appropriately showing
his patented lovability (which is still endearing, unlike Meg Ryan's
narcissistic cuteness), Hanks also takes on a new role for him: the
dashing all-American hero.  Moments of passion are beautifully
complimented by a quiet, wordless, expressionless sorrow, and it is
easy to see the feelings that lie beneath the stony, professional-NASA
exterior.  Under Hanks' guidance, Lovell becomes a person with
astounding subtlety and range of emotions.</P>
<P>     Gary Sinise, (whom I didn't personally rave over in FORREST GUMP)
outdoes himself with a spellbinding performance as grounded astronaut
Ken Mattingly.  His emotions are so incredibly tangible that I was
moved to tears (extremely rare for me ... this is the second movie I've
*ever* teared up at) at one particularly touching scene of his.  During
much of the film, I felt horribly sorry for Mattingly.  However, this
is remedied by his later, amusing, smugness, and the fact that were he
not grounded, the astronauts never would have been able to return
home.</P>
<P>     Kevin Bacon gives a good, solid performance as the hotshot pilot
Jack Swigert.  I've never held Bacon in much regard, so this was an
extremely pleasant surprise.  Even his character, who appeared to be the
bitter, odd-man-out replacement pilot, was a likable character.</P>
<P>     Ed Harris is wonderfully determined as the cantankerous mission
controller, Gene Kranz.  Kathleen Quinlan is touchingly real as
Lovell's devoted but unsure wife, Marilyn, and all the supporting
actors in mission control were real and wonderful.</P>
<P>     The weakest performance, I felt, came from Bill Paxton as the
ailing Fred Haise.  While he was absolutely perfect as the joker during
the first part of the film, as Haise became ill, so did Paxton's
acting.  However, I suspect that this was because he really didn't have
much of a character to work with.  But he still gives an easily
above-average performance, and it in no way hurts the film.</P>
<P>     The visual effects are absolutely stunning.  During most of the
film, I had an extremely difficult time believing that the sweeping,
vertigo-inducing shots of the spacecraft were not real.  The scenes of
the earth and moon are so beautiful and sentimental to induce tears, or
at least an amazed sigh.</P>
<P>     One thing that is interesting to note is that even though
everybody *knows* that the astronauts survived, it in no way lessens
the suspense.  You're still perfectly gripped in fear.</P>
<P>     To sum it up, this is a brilliant, mature thriller (not like
no-brainers like CONGO) as well as a serene, sentimental film.  This is
a film for anyone--for anyone who has ever lost their moon.</P>
<P>     If it doesn't get Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best
Actor, Best Direction, Best Visual Effects, and at least one Best
Supporting Actor, it will confirm my belief that there is something
terribly wrong with the world.  This is easily the best film to be
released this year.</P>
