<PRE>THE MIGHTY
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>The Mighty is a very good film, saddled with a very perplexing
advertising campaign. Based upon Rodman Philbrick's novel Freak the
Mighty, someone somewhere apparently objected to the word 'Freak', which
has been inexplicably jettisoned.  To follow that up, the ads have been
an odd hodgepodge of Sharon Stone and a bunch of medieval knights, and
while she does appear in a supporting part (as do the knights), this
hardly gives a clear idea of what the film is about:  friendship,
identity, and chivalry.</P>
<P>The Mighty is narrated by Max (Elden Henson), a giant of a kid, who's in
the seventh grade for the third time around.  Though bigger and stronger
than all the other kids, Max doesn't think too well, and is constantly
the object of ridicule.  It doesn't help matters that his father (James
Gandolfini) is imprisoned for murder, leaving Max to stay with his
grandparents (Gena Rowlands and Harry Dean Stanton).</P>
<P>The new kid next door isn't much better off.  Kevin (Kieran Culkin), is
a brilliant boy with Morquio's Syndrome...his bones have stopped
growing, but the rest of him hasn't.  Living alone with his mother
(Sharon Stone), Kevin has built a fascinating intellectual world in
which to live.  But he longs to do the things a normal kid could do.</P>
<P>Though at first Max and Kevin appear to be complete opposites, they're
actually quite complementary.  Max has the brawn, and Kevin has the
brains.  Working together, they make a team more powerful than the sum
of its parts.  Following the ideals of the legend of King Arthur, the
two friends envision themselves as knights bringing chivalry back into
an unchivalrous world.</P>
<P>Although this movie shares the theme of childhood friendship with the
recent  Simon Birch, The Mighty is able to delve for additional meaning
while managing to be just as touching.</P>
<P>The largest chunk of the credit has to go to the film's two leads.
Kieran Culkin has the seemingly showier role as Kevin, and, indeed, he
manages to express a depth of character that his elder brother Macaulay
never did.  However, he has the unfortunate benefit of working alongside
Elden Henson, who turns in a brilliant portrayal of Max.  Elden brings a
deep humanity to his role of the slow-witted giant.</P>
<P>Even though the protagonists are kids, one shouldn't assume that this is
strictly a kids movie (the rating is PG-13).  Although kids and teens
would identify with it (who hasn't felt like a freak at one point or
another), the messages are universal, and the story is fully enjoyable
for adults, too.</P>
<P>The film takes a few twists and turns, some surprising, and some not so.
However, wherever the film takes you, you'll be glad to go along for the
ride.</P>
