<PRE>"Proof of Life"</PRE>
<P>Inspired by the 1998 Vanity Fair article "Adventures in the Ransom Trade,"
by William Prochnau, director Taylor Hackford tells the tale of American
engineer Peter Bowman who, while trying to build a dam in the remote wilds
of South America, is kidnapped by guerrillas and held for a $3 million
ransom. He is abandoned by his company, but his wife Alice (Meg Ryan) won't
give up on him as she seeks the help of K&R (kidnap and ransom) expert
Terry Thorne (Russell Crowe). But, things turn out to be far trickier than
expected as negotiations drag on for months and a romance develops between
Alice and Terry in "Proof of Life."</P>
<P>Helmer Taylor Hackford has always provided interesting, star studded films
from his romantic, Oscar-nominated "An Officer and a Gentlemen" through to
the satanically satiric "Devil's Advocate." With "Proof of Life," the
director/producer takes us into the secret world of kidnap and ransom. The
end of the Cold War, over a decade ago, resulted in the end of financial
backing by the Communist countries of various rebel groups worldwide.
Without that monetary help, the revolutionaries turned to kidnapping,
demanding huge ransoms from their victims, to cover their operating costs
and expand their power base. Kidnapping became such a popular means of
making lots of money that companies operating in high risk areas began
securing "K&R" insurance for their executives.</P>
<P>In "Proof of Life," Peter Bowman is in the South American country of Tecala
trying to get his vision built - a dam that will benefit the people of that
country. But, the engineer works for an oil company that is taking
advantage of the small country and its people by forcing an oil pipeline to
be built. Bowman becomes a pawn in the conflict when rebels from the
revolutionary group, ELT, put up a roadblock and take all the innocents
they stop as hostages. Of course, Peter is, as the most visible
representative of the capitalist oil corporation, a prime candidate for
huge ransom demands.</P>
<P>Bowman, forced to trek across the Andes with his captors, leaves behind his
wife, Alice, who turns to his company for help. K&R expert Terry Thorne
(Crowe) arrives on the scene and assures Alice that all will be well and
begins the delicate mission of securing Peter's freedom. But, corporate
skullduggery and greed soon prove to be more important and Alice is told
that there is no insurance, no company and no high level help to free her
husband. With Terry suddenly taken out of the picture, she and Peter's
sister, Janis (Pamela Reed), contact a local security firm to get Peter
released, only to find out that they just want her money.</P>
<P>A crisis of conscience forces Terry to return to Tecala to help Alice get
her husband back. The arduous ransom negotiations start to drag on
interminably, week after week after week, as Terry and his rebel contact,
Marco, barter over the life of the captive engineer. As the months go by,
Terry finds himself attracted to the pretty, vulnerable Alice as he works
to secure Peter's release. When negotiations fall apart, Thorne seeks the
assistance of an American K&R man, Dino (David Caruso), who is trying to
locate a kidnapped client of his own. Action replaces talk as Terry, Dino
and his team head into the jungle to extract their clients from the hands
of the rebels.</P>
<P>"Proof of Life" covers territory that has, until recently, remained in the
misted shroud of secrecy. The world of kidnap and ransom is populated by
former members of the CIA, FBI, Interpol, SAS and the military - men who
are used to "negotiating" with an opponent holding an AK-47 assault rifle
rather than a law book. The entire K&R industry was created by the social
and economic changes in the world, necessitating its birth as a hedge
against the lucrative abduction business. The story, provided by longtime
Hackford collaborator Tony Gilroy, opens our eyes to this, until now,
secret world that has changed the revolutionaries into drug dealers and
worshippers of the almighty dollar.</P>
<P>Gilroy's screenplay, while steeped in the unknown world of K&R, has the
feel of a re-creation of that greatest of American films, "Casablanca." The
parallels between that classic and "Proof of Life" are more than passing,
though the perspective is from a unique angle. Peter Bowman replaces Victor
Laszlo (Paul Henreid) as the leader of the cause that draws Terry Thorne
(filling in for Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart)) into the fray as Peter's
potential savior. Meg Ryan takes Ingrid Bergman's place as the loyal wife
and love interest for Terry, while David Caruso's Dino takes over for
Captain Louis Renault (Claude Raines) as the good friend to the hero.
(Actually, at one point, I half expected Crowe to recite the "Of all the
gin joints in all the towns in all the world?" line from the older flick.)</P>
<P>"Proof of Life," even with the "Casablanca" comparison, is still a routine
thriller that walks through its paces well enough, but does nothing to try
to get beyond the routine. The most intriguing part of the film is the
story that follows Peter's plight while in the hands of his captors.
Bowman, before the abduction, is totally committed to his mission to help
the people of Tecala, putting the problems of getting his construction
underway ahead of the needs of Alice. Their last time together was fraught
with tension, but after the abduction, Alice becomes Peter's sole raison
d'etre, keeping the man from falling into utter despair as his
incarceration drags on. The romance that buds between Alice and Terry
simply adds a bit more controversy to the film.</P>
<P>The production of "Proof of Life" was reportedly plagued by disaster and
political intrigue throughout its making. The director made the decision to
shoot the film on location in Ecuador and Hackford and crew found
themselves flanked by two active volcanoes, mud slides and the same threat
of kidnapping that the story, itself, is about. There was also the
unfortunate death of a stand-in for David Morse that devastated the
production team. This list of woes has its impact on the film as there is
not a great deal of energy in the perfs by the principles, with the
exception of Morse who does a fine job in what amounts to a one man show.
Isolated from his wife and the life he knows, Morse's Peter must maintain
his will to survive with only a tattered photo of Alice as a reminder of
what he had. It's a close to the chest performance that says volumes with
little dialogue.</P>
<P>The stars of "Proof of Life," Ryan and Crowe, give performances that say
"star" rather than "actor." Both give credible perfs, but there is little
of the chemistry that we've heard so much of about the couple's off-screen
amour. Because there is little spark on screen between them, I found myself
more interested in the plight of Peter than the interplay between Alice and
Terry.</P>
<P>Supporting cast is a plus with a number of small, but effective, roles that
help to flesh out the background of the film. Pamela Reed is solid as Janis
Goodman, Peter's sister, who comes to Alice's aid. Reed gives strength to
the role as her character provides the moral support that Alice needs
during such trying times. David Caruso provides the sharp cynicism and
humor to his Dino that brought the actor to our attention years ago. I hope
this signals a comeback for the talented actor who has made some bad career
decisions. Anthony Heald, as oil company honcho Ted Fellner, brings the
same oily sleaziness to his character as he gave to his doomed doctor in
"The Silence of the Lambs." Gottfried John is terrific in the little role
of captive missionary, Eric Kessler, who is instrumental in Peter's
continued survival and rescue.</P>
<P>The behind the camera work, as one expects from a Taylor Hackford film, is
uniformly first class. Veteran Polish cinematographer Slawomir Idziak,
whose credits include such works as Krysztof Kieslowski's "The Double Life
of Veronique" and "Blue," gives a sharp lushness to the mountainous prison
of Peter, while bathing his and Alice's luxurious home in a warm light that
contrasts the harshness of the mountain locale. Bruno Rubeo, who wowed us
with his production design in "Devil's Advocate," gives the same level of
attention and detail to the varied sets in "Proof of Life."</P>
<P>In the end, "Proof of Life" is an exciting travelogue into a whole new
world of international intrigue that makes you think twice about travelling
in the hot zones. The generic adventure doesn't knock my socks off, but the
film does rep the craftsmanship and attention to detail that can accompany
a big Hollywood budget. I give it a B-.</P>
