<P>I've long been a "save the best for last" kinda Chick.  I blame it on my
Childhood [whine]; growing up Poor [sob] as I did, saving the good stuff
till the end was a Coping Mechanism [boohoo] I developed early on.
That's the only "good" reason I can think of for having put off
reviewing one of the best movies out there, period, for so long.</P>
<P>I guess my tendency towards being a lazy so-and-so might also have
something to do with it.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
In 1940's Indiana, all the hyperimaginative Ralphie (Peter Billingsley)
wanted for Christmas was a genuine Red Ryder 200-shot Carbine Action Air
Rifle.  Not much to ask for, right?</P>
<P>Not if you ask Ralphie's Mom (Melinda Dillon), who firmly believes that
he'd shoot his eye out.  Ralphie's Dad (Darren McGavin) doesn't have
much to say on the subject, though; he's too busy fending off the
dreaded Bumpus Hounds, fighting a furnace that fights him back, and
considering what to do with the Major Prize he received from "Italy".
Ralphie's little brother Randy (Ian Petrella) is no help either; Randy
has his hands full making a mountain out of a molehill of mashed
potatoes.  And on top of all that, Ralphie, his brother, and his friends
Flick (Scott Schwartz) and Schwartz (R.D. Robb) find themselves under
the tyranny of neighborhood bully Scut Farcus (Zack Ward) and his
diminutive friend Yano Anaya (Grover Dill).  If only Ralphie had his
trusty Old Blue BB gun, he'd save the day!</P>
<P>His English teacher, Miss Shields (Tedde Moore), might just be Ralphie a
save-the-day chance, when she assigns his class a normally-dreaded Theme
to write.  And this year's theme? "What I Want For Christmas".</P>
<P>The Upshot:
Another reason for my not having reviewed this movie until now, is that
I found myself a little overwhelmed by the task.  How does one describe,
in short form, the smiles and shrieks of laughter one has experienced
over more than 15 years of seeing the same great movie over and over,
without sounding like a babbling, fanboyish fool who talks too much?
Wait...don't answer that...</P>
<P>Strangely enough, for quite a few of those years, I never even saw A
CHRISTMAS STORY  in its entirety; I didn't see it during its original
theatrical run, and every time I'd catch it on TV, I'd almost literally
*catch* it on TV, usually while channel surfing during the
otherwise-boring Christmas TV Season.  In fact, it wasn't until about a
year or so ago that I finally got a chance to see it all the way
through.  Boy, I sure didn't know what I was missing.</P>
<P>A CHRISTMAS STORY is a rare combination of solid, unwhitewashed family
fare, and down home humor, wrapped up with a pretty bow by a stellar
cast, a surprisingly good director, and a brilliant storyteller
("writer", I've always thought, is too small a word for those talented
few who can tell Stories that are as meaningful when spoken aloud as
they are on paper).</P>
<P>The 1940's never seemed as much fun as it did in "Christmas", and that's
as it should be.  Previous depictions of The Good Old Days were
downright *boring*.  Not so with this retelling; though A CHRISTMAS
STORY was an 80's flick, it had none of the earmarks of that bizarre
period in history, and unless I miss my guess, it kept the spirit of
Jean Shepard's novel intact.  That Shepard, with his distinctive voice
and storytelling flair, acted as narrator, only added to the authentic
feel of "Christmas".</P>
<P>Ralphie's friends, family, and neighborhood, resonated with me because
it reminded me of the close-knit, but slightly warped, neighborhood of
my youth.  Much of the credit for the genuine atmosphere of the
last-nameless family certainly goes to the actors playing them.  In the
non-cutesy roles of the imaginative Ralphie and his goofy younger
brother Randy, Peter Billingsley and Ian Petrella (respectively) have a
freshness untainted by the smartaleckyness of a Macauley Culkin in the
irritating HOME ALONE series.  I Felt Melinda Dillon's (humorous) Pain
as Mom when she tried, and failed, to eat a hot meal for want of
satisfying her family's need for a second helping; but while her
stay-at-home Mom was certainly a product of her times, she had a spark
in her eye and a strength in her voice that let the audience know that
her Time would, surely, come.  Supporting players like Scott Schwartz as
the triple-dog-dared Flick, Tedde Moore as the put-upon teacher, Zack
Ward and Yano Anaya as big bully Scut Farkus and his shortstuff toady
Grover Dill, round out a brilliantly-realized cast.</P>
<P>But for me, "Christmas" was delivered on the talents of actor Darren
McGavin as the turkey-lovin', furnace-fightin', hounddog-hatin',
cussin'-up-a-storm Dad.  I kid you not: tears *roll* whenever I watch
the histronics Dad goes through whenever he's tackling any of life's
tough problems - like what to do with his Major Award and such.
McGavin, for me, was nothing less than perfect playing a role with as
much versatility, considering previous (and future) dramatic roles he's
played, as a Robert De Niro would come to possess.</P>
<P>And just color me Floored when I found out that Bob Clark, director of
that cinematic wonder called PORKY'S, helmed "Christmas".  It's like
night and day: A CHRISTMAS STORY is about as far away from PORKY'S as
SUPERNOVA is from being a real movie.  [Of course, Clark went on later
in his career to direct the horrid BABY GENIUSES.  Go figure].  In any
case, I tip my hat to Clark for his excellent eye and ear for what was
needed to let the fabulous Jean Shepard's lovingly-told tale, come to
pass.  Which reminds me: I have to look for the book "Christmas" was
based on, Shepard's novel "In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash", to
read over the holidays.  If it's true what They say about films made
from books - "the book is always better than the movie" - reading that
novel will be a good gift to myself.</P>
<P>I gotta cut this overlong review; I could go on and on about this film,
and I'd *still* leave something out ["fa ra ra ra ra"...awww mannnnn, my
sides hurt just thinking about it].  No matter how many times I watch A
CHRISTMAS STORY, I can't help but to grin when Ralphie Goes Off on Ol'
Yellow Eyes, or when Dad rassles with the Bumpus Hounds, or when the
pre-bulimic Randy plays This Little Piggy, or when Flick demonstrates
one more place one shouldn't put one's tongue, or when Mom plays with
Dad's Ball, or...hell, just go watch the movie; you'll see what I mean!</P>
<P>DVD Thingies:
If there's anything wrong with this "Christmas" DVD, it'd have to be the
lack of extras.  There aren't any special DVD Thingies to speak of,
though seeing the original trailer was kind of a kick.  And having no
widescreen option, made Bammer an unhappy camper; I know more than a few
lovers of this "Story" groused at having to watch it in pan & scan on
DVD (though that's better than all the editing that happens to it on
commercial TV).  But I'm easy; I'd watch this movie against a brick wall
if I had to, it's *that* good.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
I need to stop being such a "save the best for last" kinda Chick; my
review about one of the mostest bestest movies I've ever seen, should've
been posted long ago, sorry.  A CHRISTMAS STORY is the kind of genuinely
heartwarming, yet sincerely funny, family flick that you wouldn't mind
watching at any time of the year.  DVD Thingies or no, it's a worthy
addition to your movie shelf.</P>
<P>A CHRISTMAS STORY (rating: greenlight):
Remember, kids: you'll shoot your eye out!</P>
