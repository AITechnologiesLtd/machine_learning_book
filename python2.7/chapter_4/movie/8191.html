<P>Contact - a solid 8 on the IMDB scale - is one of the few
intelligently written and acted SF movies I've seen recently.
SF movies tend to be either complete logical blowouts
(Independence Day/Jurassic Park/Fifth Element) or
farcical (Men in Black). While Contact has some problems
with time (a multi-national project costing hundreds
of billions of dollars completed in under three years
based on schematics from out of this world?),
it's mostly right on target.</P>
<P>What made this movie particularly good is the time
Roboert Zemeckis took with his direction.  Many SF movies are
audio/visual assaults on the senses.  There's an awful lot
of quiet against a panorama of some of the finest special
effects ever created.  The first two minutes of
the movie set the tone and style for what's to come.
When there is a visual assault late in the movie, it's
a brief interlude  comparable to the climax of 2001.</P>
<P>The performances are pretty good - Rob Lowe is so smarmy as
the Ralph Reedish-character you want to slap him - and
Zemeckis wisely doesn't let the special effects overshadow
the characters.  People complained about the insertion of
Bill Clinton video in this movie, but I thought it mostly
worked.  I would like to have seen a little more of John
Hurt as the mysterious billionaire, but I suppose it added
to his mystery.</P>
<PRE>I think Carl Sagan would have been proud of how his baby
turned out.</PRE>
