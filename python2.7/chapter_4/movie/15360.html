<PRE>Slums of Beverly Hills</PRE>
<P>Starring Alan Arkin, Natasha Lyonne and Marisa Tomei.
Directed By Tamara Jenkins.
Running Time: 1 hour 30 minutes.</P>
<PRE>(Fox Searchlight)</PRE>
<P>Appearing from nowhere, Slums of Beverly Hills turns out to be a pleasant
surprise. Lyonne plays teenager Vivian, who hates her large breasts. We join
her and her family during their adventures in the 'slums' of Beverly hills
(those two floored apartment buildings.) Adding some spice to the drama
Tomei who plays tearaway Rita who's just escaped from a rehab clinic and
lives with Vivian, her dad Murray (an excellent Arkin) and two brothers
Ricky and Ben (Eli Marienthal and David Krumholtz.) Also joining in the fun
is Eliot (Kevin Corrigan) their Jewish neighbour.</P>
<P>Although Slums is nothing more than another coming of age, it is a well made
and funny one. Jenkins, who both directed and wrote the film, has bought to
the screen a wonderfully witty, poignant film that is very hard to dislike.
Although nothing much really happens in the film as a whole, many of the
individual vinaigrettes are funny, and very truthful. Jenkins based much of
this film on her own experiences, and it shows. None of the scenes seemed
force, the whole movie feels natural. And many are downright hilarious. A
scene involving an vibrator had the whole cinema doubled over (even if the
punchline was obvious) and their are various other jokes in the film that
raise laughs.</P>
<P>The cast are also excellent. Lyonne brings an intense honesty to her role,
and Tomei delivers an excellent performance as the dizzy Rita (even better
than her performance in My Cousin Vinny.) Kevin Corrigan is highly memorable
as the intellectual Eliot, and the two brothers are also very good. The best
performance goes to Alan Arkin, however, as the bald headed, stressed out
father. His very natural handling of his character makes him shine through,
he has a gentle honesty about him.</P>
<P>While the acting and events are well realised, there are some flaws with
character development and plot. Sadly, the plot is very threadbare, it seems
more like an collection of sketches loosely tied together. And although the
characters are all likeable, they seem a little stereotypical. Jenkins tries
to develop the characters, but it comes off a little cliched, which is a
little disappointing. The movie never really strays away from the coming of
age formula.</P>
<P>Still, with the excellent performances, the funny jokes, and a bouncy music
score, it is very hard to dislike the movie. While there are problems with
the plot and character development that can be hard to ignore, the honesty
and humour of the film nearly wins through. Jenkins has delivered a
promising debut: let's hope she can work on the flaws for her next movie.</P>
