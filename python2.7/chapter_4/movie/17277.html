<PRE>The Rage: Carrie 2
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1999 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*1/2 (Out of ****)</PRE>
<P>"There's nothing new under the sun" is a phrase often used when the speaker
actually means "Let's find something to copy."</P>
<P>Of course there are very few completely original ideas. Even earth-shattering
concepts are built upon the vast body of human experience. There is, after
all, no need to re-invent the wheel time after time.</P>
<P>Recently it seems that Hollywood doesn't feel the need to even re-write the script.</P>
<P>My understanding of the word "sequel" is a continuation of the story. The film
industry has defined the word to mean reshooting the original with minor changes.</P>
<P>Have an overwhelming desire to see an inferior version of Brian DePalma's
adaptation of the Steven King novel? This is your dream come true.</P>
<P>Rachel (Emily Bergl), a high school outcast, is beginning to notice weird
things happening around her. Doors slam shut by themselves. Glass globes blow up.</P>
<P>Her mother has severe mental problems and her father is absent. A popular boy
unexpectedly asks her out. The in-crowd conspires to embarrass her at a public event.</P>
<PRE>Any of this sound familiar?</PRE>
<P>Once the audience catches on that this is the same story as "Carrie", there's
little to do but wait for the inevitable ending. The effects are a bit better
this time around, but the film doesn't work nearly as well.</P>
<P>There are a couple of minor plot differences. Rachel lives with foster parents
because her mother is institutionalized. The boys at her school are portrayed
as even more evil than in the original. They keep score of their scoring with
points given for each conquest. And, uh, there must be other story changes but
none stand out.</P>
<P>One nice touch is the casting of Amy Irving again as Sue Snell. Over 20 years
ago she was the one girl who tried to help Carrie. Now a high school
counselor, she befriends Rachel, but her character's potential is squandered.</P>
<P>There's too much about Sue that doesn't make sense. After the slaughter when
Carrie kills most of her classmates, Sue is driven mad and spends time in the
institution that Rachel's mother is in. Still living in the same small town,
the woman with a well-known history of mental problems is hired as a high
school counselor?</P>
<P>Sue tells Rachel that her telekinesis is a genetic disease. This may be the
one original idea in the film, but the reasoning behind describing psychic
powers as a "disease" is never explained.</P>
<P>Sue's eventual fate is an admission by director Katt Shea and writer Rafael
Moreu that they had an interesting character but couldn't figure out what to
do with her. Blink and you'll miss it.</P>
<P>Some of the events are filmed in black and white, but the rationale for this
is unknown. It doesn't add anything and the choice of scenes appears somewhat random.</P>
<P>"The Rage" retains some of the trappings of "Carrie" without the meaning. In
the first film the color red was a motif connected to Carrie's onset of powers
at the same time she began menstruating. Here there's an abundance of red, but
for no apparent purpose.</P>
<P>The casting of high school jocks and cheerleaders as villains is beginning to
wear thin. One might be lead to suspect that most filmmakers were unpopular in
school and the history of teenage films is an extended cinematic revenge of
the nerds.</P>
<P>The biggest mistake the film makes is including clips of the original. Seeing
Sissy Spacek on the screen only points to the quality of that film - and the
flaws in this one.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column since "Carrie" was released and
thought about just re-writing his review of it for "The Rage". Email copies of
old letters to <A HREF="mailto:Redman@indepen.com.">Redman@indepen.com.</A>)</P>
