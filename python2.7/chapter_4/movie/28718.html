<PRE>SWORDFISH
---------</PRE>
<P>Gabriel Shear expounds on what's wrong with Hollywood - not enough realism.
An admirer of "Dog Day Afternoon," he believes that Sonny should have 
ruthlessly blown away his hostages, gotten his bus to an awaiting plane, 
and walked away.  As the camera pulls back, we discover that Gabriel's in 
the midst of an Al Pacino moment and he's prepared to follow the agenda he 
just laid out in "Swordfish."</P>
<P>"Swordfish" opens with a bang, with the newly slimmed down Travolta sporting
the most villainous hairdo since Sam Jackson's in "Unbreakable," riffing on
Al Pacino like he hasn't since "Saturday Night Fever."  He's got hostages
rigged out with C4 and ball bearings 'like the world's biggest Claymore
mines,' and when the FBI interferes, one hostage sets off a firestorm that
looks like a 360 degree shot from the British nuclear holocaust film
"Threads."</P>
<P>Now settle down for the mundane and pedestrian as the film flashes back
to the preceding four days.</P>
<P>Skip Woods' script features high tech espionage and an attempt to keep
the audience guessing via the eyes of Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackman, "X-Men"),
a hacker extraordinaire who's gone straight after a jail stint.  Stanley's 
offered $100K by Gabriel's colleague Ginger (Halle Berry, "X-Men") to just
meet with the man.  Of course he can be tempted, as his beloved daughter is
in the custody of his alcoholic ex-wife (Drea de Matteo of HBO's "The
Sopranos"), now married to a wealthy pornographic filmmaker.  He takes
the $10 million assignment to create a worm that will divert a $9.5 billion
DEA slush fund (code named Swordfish) to multiple accounts funding Gabriel's
anti-terrorist terrorism.  FBI Agent Roberts (Don Cheadle) tries to tail 
Stanley and a rigorous foot chase follows.  A corrupt Senator (Sam Shepard) 
tries to have Gabriel killed and a high speed car chase scene ensues.  This
is pretty much all just filler to get us back to where we began.</P>
<P>With a tip of the hat to "Dog Day Afternoon" again, Gabriel gets his bus,
but the twist is that he has it airlifted by a Sikorski helicopter (Gabriel
makes much of misdirection).  While one must admire the stunt crew who
really flew a bus through Los Angles skyscrapers, much of this segment seems
borrowed from the likes of "True Lies."</P>
<P>Travolta does really good bad guy - a return to his "Face/Off" form.  Young
soap actress Camryn Grimes makes Stanley's daughter Holly intriguing.  The
rest of the cast has little to do and makes little impression.</P>
<P>"Swordfish" just doesn't live up to its protagonist or do justice to his mind
games, but that incredibly complex opening segment and a cool, sleek Travolta 
almost make it worthwhile.</P>
