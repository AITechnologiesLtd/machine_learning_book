<P>Michelle Pfeiffer stars as Beth Cappadora, mother of three, wed to husband Pat
(Treat Williams).  When she loses her three year old son, Ben (Michael McElroy)
at a busy Chicago motel, Candy Bliss (Whoopi Goldberg) steps in on the
investigation, and the search to find Ben.  What results from an unrealistic
setup (How many mothers would leave their children in a busy lobby, all alone?)
is a touching drama that has its obvious problems, but are watered down by a
few choice, touching family scenes.  After a long, nine year period, Beth
believes that she has found her son, who now goes by the name of Sam (Ryan
Merriman), and lives just blocks away.  Michelle Pfeiffer gives a strong
performance as her three dimensional character, as we see the effects of losing
a son, and the awful hardships this brings to a family, even nine years after
they occur.  Stephen Schiff's screenplay, based on the best selling novel, is
the major weak spot in The Deep End of the Ocean, as many scenes and lines seem
out of place- "Your legs are longer," comes to mind.  The film doesn't seem
complete, as it is losing a final touch.  The editing is particularly choppy,
and the film is uneven.  The Deep End of the Ocean's flaws are somewhat covered
up by the strong cast, some very touching scenes, but all in all, I was hoping
for more.  </P>
<P>The Bottom Line- The Deep End of the Ocean makes for a fun, yet rather
frustrating film to watch, and is definitely worth the price for a video
rental.</P>
