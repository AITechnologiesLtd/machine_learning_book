<PRE>BABE: PIG IN THE CITY
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>I have to admit, I wasn't the biggest fan of the original movie, Babe.
The premise was cute, and the speaking-animal effects were well done,
but I still maintain that the original film was well over-praised.
Which brings us to Babe: Pig in the City, a sequel (of sorts) to Babe.
It's an unusual sequel in that it doesn't merely try to tell the same
story...but is actually markedly different. Unfortunately, different
doesn't always equate to better...</P>
<P>After an accident injures Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell), the Hoggett
farm is in serious trouble.  Mrs. Hoggett (Magda Szubanski) gathers
their famous sheep-pig, Babe (voiced by E.G. Daily), to make a guest
appearance at a state fair (where a generous appearance fee will help to
save the farm).</P>
<P>Unfortunately, things don't go quite as planned, and Mrs. Hoggett and
Babe end up in the big city (an every-city, blending many world
locales). There, the pair are taken in by a kind landlady (Mary Stein),
who is kind to animals in a city that shuns them.</P>
<P>But the city is a tough place, and this animal-friendly hotel is no
exception. There's a floor devoted to a thieving clown (Mickey Rooney)
and his group of clothes-wearing circus monkeys.  There's a floor for
dogs, and a floor for cats.  Poor Babe is stuck in the attic, a
sheep-pig with no sheep to herd.</P>
<P>Fans of the first film may be pleased that both Ferdinand the Duck
(Danny Mann), and the inexplicable singing mice are back for return
appearances.  However, this time around, James Cromwell's
Oscar-nominated role of Farmer Hoggett is relegated to a mere cameo (as
are most of Babe's friends from the first film).</P>
<P>The new film instead focuses on a new coterie of animals, but few as
charming as the original.  And while a gangster-like pit bull is
entertaining (voiced by Stanley Ralph Ross), many of the new animals
lack the strong personalities of the originals.</P>
<P>The special effects have improved since the first film.  However, the
gimmick of talking animals has long since lost its freshness (having
been done to death in television commercials and other movies).  Talking
animals alone is no longer enough to sustain a movie.</P>
<P>The film's tone is rather dark and murky at times...but then, if you
recall, so was the original (in which the animals were constantly
worried about being eaten).  But gone is the sense of whimsy which
lightened up the first Babe. Instead, this sequel just leaves an
unpleasant aftertaste.</P>
<P>The film has its share of oddities, from the strange appearance of pig
people (who have apparently escaped from the Island of Dr. Moreau)
throughout the movie, to an unusual slapstick climax that doesn't quite
work.  The sum of these make the movie unusual and distinctive, but at
times the irregularities are borderline distracting.</P>
<P>Still, Babe: Pig in the City deserves some credit for at least trying
something new, rather than sticking to the exact same formula as the
original.  But, in the end, the sequel never lives up to the original,
and stands on very shaky ground on its own.</P>
