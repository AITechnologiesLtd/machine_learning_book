<PRE>                            CENTRAL STATION
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A retired teacher who works in Rio's
          Central Station and boy who has lost his mother
          become mismatched travel companions on a
          bittersweet journey through rural Brazil.  That
          they should go from hating each other to being
          friends is a dramatic cliche, but the look at the
          lives of the poor and the pious of Brazil makes
          this film worth the trip.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10),
          high +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Oscar-nominated Fernanda Montenegro plays Dora, a retire school
teacher who earns a modest living working in Rio's Central Station, a
bus and train station.  She writes letters for the illiterate.  But she
rarely if ever mails the letters.  Instead, she cynically uses her
position to look into the lives of her uneducated clientele to laugh at
and despise them.  Hers is one of many dirty businesses that prey on
people who travel through the station.  One day Dora sees one of her
clients accidentally hit by a bus and killed leaving the client's son
Josua (played by Vinicius de Oliveira) homeless.  She is initially
untouched by the boy's plight.  Eventually she is drawn in and decides
to accompany the boy on a bus trip to be sure he finds his father.  Her
journey takes will take on many meanings as she learn to love first the
boy and through him the illiterate poor of Brazil as she learns to
understand each better.  Unlike the approach that would likely be taken
with an American or British film the poor are not shown to be quirky
and humorous.  Director Walter Salles, Jr., gives them a quiet and
pious dignity.  Chance makes Dora herself one of the rural poor, even
if only temporarily and from this vantage point she sees the poor very
differently.  She also will see this journey as a sort of last chance
to grasp life and a last chance to escape her cynicism actually feel
inspired as she once did.  Salles shows us she is in more desperation
than the boy she is helping.</P>
<P>     A Frank Capra would have handled the story making the people that
Dora meets offbeat. Salles is not quite so subtle.  He floods the film
with Biblical and religious allusions.  In the United States, religious
imagery in film often has a sinister overtone.  Certainly American
filmmakers are frequently willing to show a sinister side to religion.
Our films frequently portray fraudulent evangelists like Elmer Gantry
or vaguely sadistic Catholic schools as we saw in THE SAINT.  Salles is
making a film for a Brazilian audience for whom fervent Catholicism is
an unquestioned virtue.  For that reason frequently a viewer in the
United States will be wondering what point Salles may be trying to make
when, in fact, he will have already made his point.  We may wonder at
the significance of the Biblical names of men in Josua's family, when
the real point is just to say that these are all simple and good
people.</P>
<P>     Salles does create a definite dichotomy between city people and
country people.  City people, particularly those who work in the
station, are soulless people who look dispassionately on death for
minor infractions like shoplifting.  The country people, never well
defined, are simple, pious, and pure.  When they use Dora as a scribe,
they open into their lives a window that is purer and finer than what
Dora sees in the city people.  Oliveira's acting as the boy is simple,
but very natural.  But of equal importance with the actors is the
setting.  We see Brazil with its road stops.  We see people willing to
show Dora small kindness that it is implied they would not show her in
the city.</P>
<P>     Central Station is a road picture touching look into the lives of
the people of Brazil.  Perhaps it simplifies them a bit, but Fernanda
Montenegro gives a solid performance as a woman going through
unexpected changes.  Part of what makes her stand out for audiences is
her worn face, almost like a female Humphrey Bogart.  But her
performance is what gives the film what power it has.  I rate CENTRAL
STATION a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
