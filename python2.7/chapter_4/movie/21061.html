<P>With his latest film He Got Game, writer/director Spike Lee has crafted
a film that's both lovely and enjoyable to watch as his previous effort,
Girl 6.  Like Girl 6, Lee has chosen a subject typically worthy of an
eighty-five minute picture and fashioned it into a sweeping epic.</P>
<P>Pssssst…I'm joking.  He Got Game is a long, boring, meandering, dog of a
movie.  One might compare watching it to walking forty acres with a
mule, but I see it as more of pissing-a-kidney stone with a side order
of numb-ass.</P>
<P>The main story is simple enough to barely fill an after school special –
jailed Jake Shuttlesworth (Washington) gets a one week release from
prison to persuade his estranged son and top basketball recruit, Jesus
(NBA's Ray Allen), to attend the Governor's alma mater in an attempt to
win a chance at early parole.  Since Jake is in the big house for
killing Jesus' mom, his task seems a formidable one.</P>
<P>Among other prominent problems, Lee takes over two hours to lead the
viewer to the glaringly obvious one-on-one game between Jake and Jesus.
In fact, the two only have about four scenes together.  So what do you
fill the two hours with?  For starters, there is the completely
worthless sub-plot of Jake's romance with a fleabag whore (Jovovich).
There's also Jesus' relationship with plotting girlfriend, Lala (Rosario
Dawson).  But mostly there is a whole lot of Oliver Stone-style
flashbacks and editing, teamed with a nails-across-the-blackboard score
by Aaron Copeland.</P>
<P>On a positive note, Game features one of the most graphically hilarious
three-way sex scenes that I have ever viewed.  And there is a vomiting
scene, too.  But these are not nearly enough to make Game worthy of
renting, let alone shelling out green for.  Stay home and roll your
loose change instead.</P>
