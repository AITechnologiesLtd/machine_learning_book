<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An Amtrak train pulls into LA with accountant, Gene Watson (Johnny
Depp), and his little daughter Lynn (Chase) aboard. They are approached
in the station by Christopher Walken and Roma Maffia, posing as cops and
telling them they are being brought in for questioning. They are placed
in a van and Walken tells them if Depp hasn't killed the liberal
Governor of California Marsha Mason -- within the next 80 minutes, then
Roma will kill his daughter. The randomly chosen Depp is given a loaded
gun and the governor's schedule for the afternoon, and told in a
snarling tone by Walken that he better kill her.</P>
<P>The gimmicky premise grabs your attention, but the film fails to
maintain its suspense as the story line becomes increasingly more
absurd. Why the nondescript, Everyman character played by Depp, would
believe that Walken wouldn't kill his daughter anyway, even if he did
kill the governor, is just one of the major flaws in this ridiculous
premise.</P>
<P>The action begins to take hold, when Walken follows the conflicted
accountant on his mission and prevents him from telling anyone about
what he's been asked to do. Depp's only source of help, comes
reluctantly from a shoeshine man (Dutton).</P>
<P>The film's main sphere of operation is in the Bonaventure Hotel, where
the governor has  her headquarters and where she is scheduled to give a
speech. Walken keeps his serpentine plan going by constantly threatening
Depp with the loss of his daughter's life if he doesn't do the job.</P>
<P>The blurred reason why the governor must be eliminated, is because a
wealthy backer
wants revenge because she backed out of promises made to him and has
become too liberal. G. D. Spradlin plays this mysterious tycoon.</P>
<P>If you buy into the story line, then you should find the film
suspenseful in the Hitchcock style. If you don't, the only consolation
is that the acting was good. As far as I'm concerned, it was a
preposterous premise and even if believed, the plan was far too risky
and complicated for those involved, and there is no way the high
insiders in the governor's camp wouldn't have come up with another plan
to use, like the usual one of a professional assassin with a
high-powered rifle.</P>
<P>The only surprise the film could have for me, is if both Depp's daughter
and the governor were killed. This unnotable suspense yarn, brings
little to the table and concludes with an unsatisfying ending -- which
was more silly than tense. Director John Badham ("Saturday Night
Fever''/"Stakeout'') tells the story effectively in real time, which
makes it a watchable though forgettable film.</P>
