<PRE>AMERICAN MOVIE (M).  
(Columbia Tristar)
Director: Chris Smith
Running time: 104 minutes.</PRE>
<P>The trailer for this low budget, independently financed
documentary made it appear as if American Movie was a po-faced
piss-take on the making of The Blair Witch Project.  But it is so much
more.  The brainchild of Chris Smith, American Movie is a journey
through the frustrations and anguish of the low budget film maker.  It
is enough to either inspire all young hopeful film makers that hope
and naiveté can eventually triumph over adversity and inexperience,
or else it will send them and their cameras packing fearing that the
task of making a low budget film is almost impossible in today's
climate.</P>
<P>Smith documents the trials and tribulations of Mark Borchardt,
an aspiring young film maker from Wisconsin, as he tries to get his
masterpiece Northwestern up and running.  To raise the finance for his
feature film though he first has to complete work on his short film
Coven and then sell 3000 units on video.</P>
<P>American Movie is an up-close and intimately personal portrait
of Borchardt's struggle, both financially and spiritually, to achieve
his dream.  This film was nearly three years in the making, as Smith
followed Borchardt around, recording his frustrating efforts to
complete his film without compromising his vision or artistic
integrity.  We follow Borchardt through film festivals, trying to hype
interest in his project, as well as his endeavours to cast and
complete his short horror film.  When the going gets tough,
Borchardt's relatives, including the unforgettable 82 year old Uncle
Bill, come to the rescue, with funding and physical assistance.</P>
<P>But the most amazing character we meet here is Mike Schank,
who has provided the film's music as well as doubling as a production
assistant.  If anyone can come close to stealing a documentary then it
is the intriguing Schank, whose deadpan style and earnestness are
unforced yet endearingly hilarious.  The film also blurs the
distinction between the film maker and his subjects, as Smith and
Borchardt become friends off camera, adding yet another more intimate
dimension to the documentary.</P>
<P>So cleverly put together is this off beat film that, at times,
it is hard to tell whether American Movie is the genuine article or
yet another of the increasing series of mock documentaries (like
Bigger Than Tina, etc) that have recently hit our screens.  The
background notes certainly make it appear real!</P>
<P>Throughout the film Smith displays a dry and very droll sense
of humour, although not everyone will find the film particularly
funny.  American Movie has an almost unstructured narrative style and
many self indulgent passages that will probably appall as many as it
pleases.  American Movie will not be to everyone's tastes.  This is a
film that you will either love or hate!</P>
