<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>"American Pie" was one of 1999's funniest films. Although it was most 
notorious for the way it pushed the envelope in terms its gross and 
outrageous content, it was also a very genuine and very funny movie, and 
this set it above other comedies of its ilk. Of course, any successful 
film is bound to spawn imitators, and "Road Trip" is, I'm sure, only the 
first of many. But "Road Trip" is basically just "American Pie" writ 
small. Although it tries -- and sometimes succeeds -- for the most part 
it's not as gross, as outrageous, or as funny as its predecessor, and 
most importantly it's lacking the heart which made "American Pie" such a 
success.</P>
<P>This is most immediately obvious in the movie's premise. Whereas 
"American Pie" told a very believable, unassuming story -- four 
teenagers' attempts to lose their virginity before the senior prom -- 
"Road Trip" is much more contrived. Josh (Breckin Meyer) and Tiffany 
(Rachel Blanchard) have been friends since kindergarten and a couple 
since their early teens. But graduation has meant separation, with Josh 
attending Ithaca University and Tiffany going to the University of 
Austin. Now the two are forced to communicate mostly by phone and
videotape.</P>
<P>But Josh is also the object of desire of fellow Ithaca student Beth (Amy 
Smart). When several days pass without Josh hearing from Tiffany, he 
assumes the worst -- that Tiffany has abandoned him for another guy. 
Giving in to his lust, he brings Beth back to his dorm room after a 
party. Beth suggests they videotape their romantic encounter, and the 
drunken Josh agrees. The next morning, he discovers his pal Rubin (Paulo 
Costanzo) has accidentally mailed the sex tape to Tiffany in place of his 
regular video-gram. To make matters worse, he then finds out that the 
reason Tiffany has been out of touch is because her grandfather died 
suddenly. Josh decides he must go to Austin and retrieve the tape before 
Tiffany returns to school in three days. He, Rubin, and their friend E.L. 
(Seann William Scott, who was Stifler in "American Pie") convince wormy
but vehicularly-enabled Kyle (DJ Qualls) to join them in a wild and wacky 
road trip south.</P>
<P>In the wake of increasingly ribald comedies like "American Pie" and 
"There's Something About Mary", I expected "Road Trip" would go even 
further in the gross-out department -- especially given the inclusion in 
the cast of Comedy Central grossmeister Tom Green. Surprisingly, though, 
it's really pretty tame; only a scene at a diner is notably crude. Other 
moments try to be disgusting, but ultimately the cringe factor is 
unexpectedly low. Or maybe I'm just becoming desensitized to that kind of 
thing. Even the nudity -- which is about the only category in which "Road 
Trip" outpaces "American Pie" -- is generally inoffensive, although that 
may be as much to prevent the film being prohibitively rated as for any 
aesthetic reasons.</P>
<P>To be fair, "Road Trip" is pretty funny, but it never manages to sustain 
its momentum. Many scenes work, but more than a few misfire, or aren't 
exploited to their full comic potential. For example, at one point the 
lads pretend to be members of a fraternity in order to get a place to 
crash for the night, only to discover its members are all black. The 
sequence starts off well, but the tension is defused surprisingly 
quickly, and the whole thing feels abbreviated. Part of the technique 
used by "American Pie" and "Mary" was to take a funny situation, and then 
push it farther than anyone could have anticipated (the infamous "franks
and beans" scene in the latter, for example). "Road Trip" seems unwilling 
to be quite so adventurous, and is really a conventional film making a 
pretense of being controversial.</P>
<P>Much of the disparity between "Road Trip" and "American Pie" stems from 
the lack of characterisation in the new release. Whereas most of the 
denizens of "American Pie" were well-crafted and convincing, the 
population of "Road Trip" is mostly forgettable. Only Kyle really works: 
Qualls somehow manages to carry himself with a quiet dignity, rather than 
just playing the stereotypical college nerd. Although he's still an 
exaggeration, no character is easier to relate to than Kyle, and his 
transformation over the course of the film is by far its most interesting 
element.</P>
<P>Also very good are two supporting players who enjoy subplots of their own 
away from the main "road trip" storyline. Green, as eternal Ithaca 
student Barry, handles his material well and looks like he could easily 
carry a leading role in the future. Indeed, although I find the quality 
of Green's television programme highly variable, he's consistently 
enjoyable here. Smart, from TV's "Felicity", is somewhat wooden when 
interacting with the other leads. But once her character is misdirected 
by Barry to Boston (instead of Austin) in pursuit of Josh, she becomes
more comfortable with the role, and the scenario plays out amusingly.</P>
<P>The rest of the cast doesn't do quite so well. Meyer is amiable but 
two-dimensional as Josh; this is unfortunate because a strong center 
could have really helped pull "Road Trip" together. Scott seems to be 
replicating his "American Pie" character, but his material here is not 
nearly as strong. And Costanzo wanders through the movie in a state of 
perpetual listlessness, a condition which can only partly be justified by 
Rubin's drug habit. The meagre attempt toward the end of the film to give 
the character a bit of substance seems tacked on and is a poor fit with 
the film's overall mood.</P>
<P>It would be unfair to say that "Road Trip" is a step back for the teen 
comedy genre, but it's certainly a movie that is satisfied to hold the 
course rather than forging into new territory. And given that what's made 
the genre successful in recent years has been a fervent drive to push 
ever farther, that's tantamount to failure in of itself. "Road Trip" is 
good for a few laughs, but it's no "American Pie".</P>
