<PRE>                              ASSASSINS and TO DIE FOR
                       A film review by Michael John Legeros
                        Copyright 1995 Michael John Legeros</PRE>
<P>     As hard as I struggle against the demons of preconceived notion, I
must confess to having expected both the best and the worst this
weekend, with the local arrivals of ASSASSINS and TO DIE FOR.  The
pre-release buzz was polarized: previewers flunked the former, while
critics lavished the latter.  Imagine my surprise, when ASSASSINS
proved watchable and TO DIE FOR a bit of a bore.</P>
<P>     To paraphrase somebody else, ASSASSINS doesn't suck.  The cold,
often humorless story of two rival "contract artists" may not be very
exciting, but at least you can watch it.  Director Richard Donner
(LETHAL WEAPON) seems to be aiming for more than pointless pyrotechnics
and he might've hit his mark with a thinner, less-contrived story.
(These characters do the *dumbest* things.  Such as the absurd
one-door-and-one-door-only finale.) Time passes, though, thanks to the
playful chemistry between Stallone and Banderas.  They're a pair.  The
cat-loving, fur-hating, surveillance-expert love-interest is played by
Julianne Moore, who *must* have something on somebody to be
miraculously spared a love scene with the Italian Stallion.</P>
<PRE>Grade: C+</PRE>
<P>     TO DIE FOR is also flat.  Curiously flat, given the praise its
raised in recent days.  There's satire to spare in director Gus Van
Sant's pitch-black comedy about tabloid fame, thanks to a wicked script
from GRADUATE scribe Buck Henry, from the novel by Joyce Maynard, from
the real-life incident.  Nicole Kidman does her second star turn of the
year and it's a sizzler.  (Think Alicia Silverstone meets Linda
Fiorentino.) She's backed by a superb supporting cast that includes
Matt Dillon, Joaquin Phoenix, and an unbilled George Segal, who, these
days, looks remarkably like Richard Crenna.  Have we seen these guys in
the same room together?  TO DIE FOR is played in faux-documentary
fashion, with most of the characters speaking into the camera.  And
that's the joke.</P>
<PRE>Grade: B</PRE>
