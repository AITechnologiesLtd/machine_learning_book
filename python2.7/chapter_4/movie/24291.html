<PRE>Hamlet
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>A new school of acting should be constructed based on the method of
Ethan Hawke.  I am the first to admit that I enjoy Ethan Hawke in almost
anything he does.  The reason I like him so much is because he brings
the essence of the brooding soul to the screen so well.  Hawke plays
Tortured Guy so perfectly they should give an award at the Oscars every
year and call it the `E. Hawke Award for Best Brooding Performance of
the Year'. As a natural-born brooder, the character of Hamlet perfectly
suits Hawke because the role has always been given to older guys looking
to validate their dramatic acting chops.  Hawke's Hamlet is the
Generation X Hamlet.  A Hamlet that uses his `discontent' with the world
as a razor against the neck of reality.</P>
<P>This updated 20th century Hamlet is brought to vivid realism by
independent director Michael Almereyda.  Almereyda places the play in
the year 2000, creating the state of Denmark as a huge conglomerate, the
slain king a CEO, and Hamlet as a digital video maker.  This
interpretation sounds almost like it's going to be as much fun as a
ten-car pileup on the expressway; you want to turn your head away from
in disgust but are strangely curious about what happened.</P>
<P>The surprise is that this is one of the best versions of Hamlet.
Almereyda has studied every film and stage version of the play, and his
history lessons have paid off.  He creates a stark, unflinching vision
of a dangerous world where trust is a lost commodity and betrayal is
weapon.</P>
<P>Hawke carries the vehicle well with his unflinching performance of a
haunted man pushed to the brink, finding solace among the haunting
visions of dead souls and images he captures with his camera.  The
supporting cast of Kyle Machlachan, Julia Stiles, Diane Venora, Bill
Murray-- doing a damn good job with the dialogue -- and Sam Shepard are
surprising in their ability to convey the motivations of the
characters.  Almereyda does an incredible job of taking the text and
rearranging the structure to capture a better essence of Hamlet as it
exists in the 21st century.  The most enjoyable scene is when Hamlet
recites the `To Be or Not to Be' while he is walking up and down the
aisles of a Blockbuster Video.  The imagery of the enormity of the
aisles and the sense of Hamlet lost within a world of escapism is
haunting and strangely unnerving.  Julia Stiles equally provides a quiet
reserve to the character of Ophelia and her muted voice speaks strongly
in scenes as others determine her fate for her.</P>
<P>Michael Almeryda's Hamlet is dangerous and sharp-edged.  It retains a
clear hold of the text and doesn't try to dress up the scenes with
numerous cuts and flashy imagery.  The actors smoothly roll through the
acts and do not drag things down with dramatic flair.  Speakerphones,
video, digital still photos, laptops, and cell phones are used as not
only showpieces, but also as valid devices to communicate the play's
text.  If more classic plays can be updated with such brilliance, maybe
more people will put down their Backstreet Boys biographies and pick a
Hemingway novel or a Shakespearean play and start to understand the
world around us.</P>
