<PRE>THE END OF THE AFFAIR (Columbia)
Directed by Neil Jordan</PRE>
<P>     There's an old British saying, "in for a penny, in for a pound,"
which applies perfectly to "The End of the Affair," a demanding,
thought-provoking film adapted from Graham Greene's novel of the same
name. It's a movie built around a theme many will find difficult to
accept, that miracles can happen to perfectly ordinary, non-religious
people.</P>
<P>If you can believe that, you're well on your way to being drawn in
by this story of an illicit WWII liaison between novelist Maurice
Bendrix (Ralph Fiennes) and Sarah Miles (Julianne Moore), the wife of a
perpetually glum diplomat. Sarah is in the tenth year of a joyless
marriage to Henry (Stephen Rea) and if there was ever any fire in the
relationship, it's long since died. "I'm the shadow he walks around,"
she says. Henry, for his part, tries to hold on to her by promising her
a life in the highest circles of London society. "Wouldn't you like to
be Lady Miles?" he asks, trying to get her excited about future
possibilities.</P>
<P>But Sarah would take passion over prestige any day, and that's what
she finds during her stolen afternoons and evenings with Maurice. That
is, until a disaster that comes literally out of the clear blue forces
her to make a dramatic and mystifying change in her life, one which
brings sorrow to all involved.</P>
<P>"Affair" has surface similarities to "The English Patient," the
Oscar-winning 1996 hit that cemented Fiennes' place among contemporary
matinee idols, and director Neil Jordan (who also penned the screenplay)
doesn't skimp on scenes of Fiennes and Moore working up a sweat as they
wrinkle the sheets together to the strains of Michael Nyman's ravishing
score. But in many ways, this is a much more daring and challenging
piece. Sarah's climactic decision and her determination to abide by it
regardless of the pain it causes her make this less a romance than a
study of a woman's capacity for sacrifice. Sarah metamorphoses before
our eyes from a bored, chic housewife into an astonishingly complex and
troubled individual desperate to figure out exactly what she's doing and
why she's doing it.</P>
<P>In short, it's the kind of role actresses dream of tackling, and
Moore runs with it, eagerly trying to sort out the secrets of Sarah's
heart. It's a spellbinding performance, one that's very nearly matched
by Fiennes, who's piercing blue eyes serve as windows into Maurice's
mind. What makes Fiennes such a riveting actor to watch, however, is
what he doesn't reveal. We can always feel him holding just a little bit
back, silently challenging us to pay closer attention to his words and
behavior. As the outsider whose love for his wife is reawakened when he
realizes she's lost to him, Rea conveys fully what it's like to be in
Henry's lusterless shoes. The trio is superbly supported by Ian Hart and
Sam Bould as a father-son detective team caught between the three sides
of the triangle.</P>
<P>"Affair" marks a solid comeback for Jordan, whose last film was
the almost unwatchable "In Dreams," a cartoonish melodrama about a
serial killer (Robert Downey Jr.) and a psychic (Annette Bening). This
film returns him to the kind of character-based drama of his best work,
such as "Mona Lisa" and "The Crying Game." He cloaks the bodies of his
lovers in shadows and rain while exposing their souls. James Sanford</P>
