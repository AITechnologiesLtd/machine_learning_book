<PRE>WHY DO FOOLS FALL IN LOVE?
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Why Do Fools Fall in Love is an unusual biopic...one that isn't terribly
interested about its subject.  It's more concerned with the various
other lives which are intersected and thrown into turmoil.</P>
<P>Why Do Fools Fall in Love tells the story of singer Frankie Lymon
(Larenz Tate), who in 1955 wrote his first smash hit (the title song),
at the age of 13.  However, his star burned bright and brief.  He
quickly spiraled into despair, drugs and death.</P>
<P>The film takes place in 1986, and reveals Frankie's story in
flashbacks.  Many years after his death, Diana Ross performs a
best-selling version of Why Do Fools Fall in Love...adding many dollars
to Frankie's previously bankrupt estate. Soon, there is not one, but
three separate women who each claim to be Frankie's widow, and entitled
to the fortune.</P>
<P>One woman is Zola Taylor (Halle Berry), a singer with The Platters, who
toured sometimes with Frankie.  Another is Elizabeth Waters (Vivica A.
Fox), a shoplifter who helps Frankie through the lowest valleys of his
life.  The third is Emira Eagle (Lela Rochon), a somewhat prissy
schoolteacher who loved Frankie during his final days.</P>
<P>It's difficult to point out exactly where Why Do Fools Fall in Love goes
wrong. For starters, it drags on about a half an hour too long.  Each
woman tells her own story about Frankie Lymon, and by the time you've
reached the second one, you're ready for the film to end.</P>
<P>The film tries to portray Frankie in three different lights, as seen by
each of his three "wives".  However, the pictures they paint aren't as
surprisingly dissimilar as they claim to be.  Add to that the fact that
Frankie never truly emerges as a compelling enough character for a two
hour biopic, and you're in for a long sit.</P>
<P>Still, although Larenz Tate is somewhat undefined in his role, the three
lead actresses give it a good try.  None of them are quite convincing in
their "middle-aged" scenes set during the 1980s, however.  Of the three,
Vivica A. Fox has the juiciest role, and is quite convincing as the
unlikely target of Frankie's love who would (and does) do anything to
prove her devotion.</P>
<P>Why Do Fools Fall in Love has an interesting concept, but is poorly
executed. The film should have put more focus on Frankie, and why he was
the way he was. Instead, we are left with a collection of fading
memories that are never quite as vibrant when told second-hand.</P>
