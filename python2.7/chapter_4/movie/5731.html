<P>     Fresh from the success of New Line Cinema's release of RUMBLE IN
THE BRONX, Dimension Films has repackaged another Jackie Chan
action-comedy.  POLICE STORY III: SUPERCOP, a 1992 release, has been
dubbed into largely inflection-less English, re-cut with a new title
sequence, and re-scored with a hip soundtrack that includes Tom Jones
singing "Kung Fu Fighting" over the closing credits.  Groan.  The result
is a rather run-of-the-mill rouser about an affable Hong Kong police
detective and martial arts expert (Chan) who, along with his Interpol
side-kicking sidekick (Michelle Khan), infiltrates a Chinese drug ring.</P>
<P>     If released at any other time in the year, SUPERCOP might win some
raves.  However, when played alongside such sure-to-pleasers as
INDEPENDENCE DAY and A TIME TO KILL, the experience almost seems a waste
of adrenaline.  Chan's self-performed stunts are remarkable enough,
sure, but director Stanley Tong delivers nowhere near the amount
suggested by the ads.  The finale is a corker: an amazing helicopter and
train chase with Chan and Company kung-fu fighting on top of a moving
choo choo.  And then, when the bad guys are defeated and the Eastern
world is again safe, the customary outtake reel rolls to reveal how they
did all those scary-looking stunts.</P>
