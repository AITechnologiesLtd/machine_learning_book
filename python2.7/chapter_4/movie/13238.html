<PRE>Directed and Written by : Woody Allen
Produced by : Jean Doumanian</PRE>
<PRE>Film Rating : A- (*** 1/2)</PRE>
<P>IN 'BULLETS OVER BROADWAY' and 'Mighty Aphrodite', supporting actresses
not only received nominations for Academy Awards(3) , but 2 won. The same
could have been said for 'Deconstructing Harry', but there were simply too
many to consider. </P>
<P>On the surface (the first twenty minutes) of DECONSTRUCTING HARRY, Allen
(director, writer, actor) creates a disturbing element of comedy. He
despises so many things, and fears many more. A scene at the beginning is
so enigmatic, we wonder how he could, in any sense of the word, create a
comedic situation. In the beginning, two explicit sex scenes are noted, two
serious violent threats, one disturbing conversation with a psychologist,
and countless acts of swearing. The transition to comedy starts as
supporting actors start to detail Harry Block's situation (the main
character, played predictably by Allen) , when we here their troubling
trials with a man, who, self-proclaimingly states later in the movie, "I
put my art into my work." The onslaught of cynicism in this part of the
movie is at its highest, and also at the point where he criticizes himself,
and, acting childishly, expects everyone to forgive him. As a result, he
develops 'writing block.'</P>
<P>The middle of the movie focuses around a trip Harry Block is making with a
prostitute, a hypochondriac, and his son (who he kidnapped while exiting a
school bus). First on this trip is a stop at a carnival, where Allen has
surreal experiences with characters he himself creates, including one scene
of adultery in the process of being covered-up, with Judy Davis ( a scene,
by the way, that is worth being noted for its hilarious look at a person
who is flattered with herself.) The next stop is at a half-sister's estate,
where her right-wing Semetic husband seems bent on spreading criticism of
Allen's abstinence from Judaism, while, at the same time, intent on
spreading his own propaganda. Allen states to this man, "You're the
opposite of paranoid. Contrary to all the available evidence, you still
think people like you." The last stop places Allen at a university, where
they are hoping to present him with an award. However, the hypochondriac's
worst dream (or best hope) comes true as he dies. So Harry has shown up at
his old university with a prostitute and a dead body. </P>
<P>In the conclusion, at some other location, Allen is arrested for
kidnapping his son, solicitation of prostitution, and possession of a
deadly weapon (from an early scene with Judy Davis.) But before this, Allen
is on an elevator which apparently leads to Hell. ( Example of who is in
Hell : "Third Floor : Media. Sorry, that level has filled up.") There he
runs into the devil (Billy Crystal) , who reviews all the horrible things
he's done in his life, and prophesized the above event. </P>
<P>In jail, two friends bail him out, and he has a imaginary recognition
ceremony (obviously, when Allen was arrested, he hadn't received his award
yet.) At this ceremony, all of the characters in the movie are applauding
him, and, there and then, his writing block is solved, and he starts
writing a novel about, "A man who can only be artistic in work, not life." </P>
<P>This film is as all Allen's released are : wonderful. The acting of
supporting characters is never very long, and as such, it would be very
hard to nominate any one person for an award. This certainly is not a movie
for everyone, and some may find it offensive. Actually, nearly all will
find it offensive, but some will not be able to draw comedy from this
offensiveness. I must lend my recommendation to this film, for it really
does capture the comedy that is so Woody Allen like. Ironically, most
people will like Woody Allen in this movie for hating himself.</P>
