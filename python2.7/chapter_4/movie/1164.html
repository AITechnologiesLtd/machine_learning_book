<PRE>                                  BLACK ROBE
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     BLACK ROBE is movie directed by Bruce Beresford from a script by
Brian Moore and based Moore's 1985 novel of the same name.  The film
stars Lothaire Bluteau, Aden Young, Sandrine Holt, August Schellenberg,
and Tantoo Cardinal.  Rated R due to violence, sex.</P>
<P>     BLACK ROBE is the story of an odyssey, both physical and spiritual,
of a French Jesuit missionary who in 1634 sets out from the Quebec of
Champlain 1500 miles with a band of Algonquins by canoe to a mission
which may or may not exist.  The priest, Father Laforgue, is played by
Lothaire Bluteau.  (Bluteau played the title role in JESUS OF MONTREAL.)
Laforgue begins as a rigid European dedicated to saving the savages,
ends as someone else.</P>
<P>     Brian (pronounced Bree-an) Moore, the author of THE LONELINESS OF
JUDITH HEARNE and THE LUCK OF GINGER COFFEY (which both became movies),
was quick, in an interview with The Seattle Times' John Hartl this week,
to dismiss comparisons of BLACK ROBE with DANCES WITH WOLVES.  Both
films are revisionist historical dramas about the doomed cultures of
Native Americans in their early contacts with whites.  Both use the
white character as the narrative focus.  Both use Native American actors
in appropriate roles and depict them speaking their own languages.  Both
use subtitles for the non-English dialogue.  Moore said, "[DWW] is an
old-fashioned, main-stream movie, except that the whites are the bad
guys.  And the Indians are all absolute saints, just like they were in
THE MISSION.  We tried not to do that."</P>
<P>     "The only thing that shocked us when we saw DANCES WITH WOLVES was
the use of subtitles for the Indians.  We thought our film would be the
first to do that."</P>
<P>     One obvious difference is that BLACK ROBE exposes its audience to a
different cultural group than the more commonly used Plains Indians,
namely Northern Woodlands culture.  Three native groups appear in the
film: Algonquins, Iroquois, and Hurons.  They are distinctively depicted
and even the Iroquois are presented as humans, albeit with their own
standards and expectations.  This difference by itself makes the film
fascinating and novel.</P>
<P>     The Native Americans by speaking their own languages and commenting
on the actions and ideas of the whites, especially Laforgue, give us a
Rashomon-esque effect -- multiple perceptions creating multiple truths
-- give the audience new insights into their own culture.  The culture
clashes, the culture shocks are often amusing, the only comic relief
often in what is mostly a very serious, tense and sober film, full of an
air of impending disaster, like the fall moving toward winter.</P>
<P>     Another cinematic quality that recommends BLACK ROBE is the use of
landscape photography.  Every outdoor shot frames scenery that is often
literally breath-taking; by that I mean that I gasped frequently at the
backgrounds of the human drama transpiring in the foreground.
Beresford's cinematographer is Peter James, who worked on DRIVING MISS
DAISY and MISTER JOHNSON, too.  Because of budgetary limitations the
film was pretty much shot in narrative order to capture the changing
seasons.  Beresford added flashbacks to Laforgue's earlier life in
France as well as black-and-white dream sequences.  These try to do the
job of the internal monologues that dominate Moore's novel.  One of the
Seattle critics thought the film needed a voice-over narration.  I'm
just as glad they avoided that since voice-overs are so problematical.
I think the photography and Bluteau's skills as an actor are sufficient
to fill us on what and why people are thinking and doing as they do.</P>
<P>     Bluteau is an impressive screen presence.  His role is physically
demanding and his character's impassivity and surpressed emotions make
his job all the harder.  He was hardly recognizable as the same actor
who played JESUS OF MONTREAL, a credit to his skills.</P>
<P>     The other actors are uniformly convincing.  Aden Young is plays a
young French who gets permission to travel and assist Black Robe,
ostensibly "for the greater glory of God," but in reality because he's
bored with building huts for Champlain and wants to go adventuring.
August Schellenberg plays the Algonquin chief who becomes a spiritual
teacher for Laforgue, Tantoo Cardinal his wife, and Sandrine Holt his
daughter who shocks Laforgue into a new way of thinking.</P>
<P>     I have one nit to pick, however.  The film makes a point of having
Native Americans speaking their own languages, but the French characters
all speak English.  Father Laforgue's "Indian" name is Black Robe and
when the Native Americans are speaking in their own languages about
Black Robe, they literally say "Black Robe", not even "Robe noir" or
whatever the phrase is in French.  Why don't the French speak French?
Film-making conventions permit us to pretend they are speaking French
instead of English, but given the subtitling of some of the non-English,
this inconsistency and convention becomes all the more illogical and
distracting.</P>
<P>     The film is a joint Canadian-Australian production.  A Canadian
director was originally set to film BLACK ROBE but Moore didn't like the
script and resisted pressure to create a violent hook to open the film.
Fortunately, Beresford came along with the $107 million dollars of clout
from DRIVING MISS DAISY behind him.  There is no U. S. (Hollywood) money
in the production -- although Samuel Goldwyn is distributing the film in
the U.S., as they did HENRY V and LONGTIME COMPANION, two other
hard-to-sell movies -- and it shows both negatively and positively.  The
negatives include a certain lack of visual richness or depth, the kind
of budget shortcuts that one sees in TV movies; one can seldom forget
that one is watching modern people wearing funny clothes.  The positives
include a spiritual depth that makes DANCES WITH WOLVES seem all the
more a shallow star-vehicle that it may have originally.</P>
<P>     Laforgue changes, softens and humanizes his European, Christian
"superiority."  The natives change in various ways that will lead to
their cultural (and physical) extinction.  Laforgue's intentions are
sincere, even when he's being a bigot; his love for the natives at the
end is real.  But he and the rest that will follow are the agents of one
of the great cultural tragedies of history.  BLACK ROBE does the best
job of any similar film I've seen of presenting the Native Americans as
they were.  It neither embraces (or patronizes) them or the stereotypes
built up about them.  They are people, who deserved better than they
got.</P>
<P>     The next step is a film without a white lead on whom to hang the
narrative.  There have been a few over the years, such as the estimable
POWWOW HIGHWAY, but they were mostly independent films with limited
exposure.</P>
<P>     BLACK ROBE cannot, I think, ever find a mass audience a la DANCES
WITH WOLVES.  The main drawback to achieving mass success is that BLACK
ROBE requires an audience that knows something, that can think, that
doesn't require cinematic hand-holding or unambiguous narrative.</P>
<P>     BLACK ROBE is a powerful, beautiful film that is sure to have an
effect on the audiences that do see it, an effect that will be hard to
dismiss or forget.</P>
<P>     I recommend BLACK ROBE at full prices, but do be forewarned that
there is some gruesome violence in the middle of the film.  I closed my
eyes and told Lyndol to tell me when it was over.</P>
