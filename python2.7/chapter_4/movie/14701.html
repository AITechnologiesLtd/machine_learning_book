<PRE>U.S. Marshals (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>*** out of *****</PRE>
<P>Cast: Tommy Lee Jones, Wesley Snipes, Robert Downey Jr., Joe Pantoliano,
Kate Nelligan, Irene Jacob
Written by: John Pogue
Directed by: Stuart Baird
Running Time: 133 minutes</P>
<P>Stuart Baird, director of the vastly underrated Executive Decision,
directs the sequel to 1993's The Fugitive. Tommy Lee Jones returns as
Lt. Sam Gerard (and his entire supporting cast returns as well) to
chase another innocent fugitive, played by Wesley Snipes. Snipes plays
an ex-government agent who has been set-up for murder by corrupt
government agents (ooo, shocking) and once again Gerard must chase
after him.</P>
<P>U.S. Marshals is nowhere near as good as The Fugitive thanks to it's
overused and predictable story. I mean, a government conspiracy? You
mean there may be some corruption in government?? Also, all attempts
to outdo the first film fall completely flat. For example, the train
wreck and waterfall jump from the first film are superior in every way
to the plane crash and building jump in this one. And despite the fact
that we're told that Snipes is innocent, his character just isn't very
compelling. Several times he is attempting to kill members of Gerard's
team, including Gerard himself. Harrison Ford's character was never
shooting at anyone. We're supposed to like this guy, and he's trying
to kill the other people we're supposed to like as well.</P>
<P>The film certainly isn't dull, but you've seen all of it before. The
direction is good and the acting is fine, it's just the story that
fails.  Also, the dialogue between Gerard and his team, which seemed
so credible in the first film, seems so forced and phony here. If
anything, U.S. Marshals will remain memorable to me thanks to Tommy
Lee Jones' initial appearance, dressed as a giant chicken. It's
definitely a sight to see, and the whole scene is just about worth the
price of admission. [PG-13]</P>
