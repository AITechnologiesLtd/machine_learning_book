<P>Remember the scene in "Scream 2" where the film student ranted about how 
slasher movie sequels are almost always crap? "I Still Know What You Did 
Last Summer" is a textbook example of everything he was talking about. 
Aside from a grim relentlessness, this generic offering has absolutely 
nothing to warrant a viewing. I'm required to see films like this -- it's 
in my job description -- but you don't have to.</P>
<P>In this colorless Xerox, Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) is away at 
school, dividing her time between nightmares and hallucinations of Ben 
Willis (Muse Watson), the slicker-wearing, hook-wielding killer from the 
original film. She continues her romantic involvement with fellow 
survivor Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr.), but he's back home in North 
Carolina, and the distance, coupled with Julie's phobia about returning 
home, is straining their relationship.</P>
<P>Julie's chronically perky roommate Karla Wilson (Brandy) wins a vacation 
for four to the Bahamas and she invites her stressed-out girlfriend to 
come along. When Ray fails to show up, a dejected Julie takes off with 
Karla, Tyrell (Mekhi Phifer), Karla's horny boyfriend, and Will Benson 
(Matthew Settle), a boy-next-door type with a serious Julie fixation.</P>
<P>Of course, there's a good reason why Ray didn't show up. While traveling 
north with a buddy to surprise Julie, he encountered a body in the middle 
of the road. Oh my goodness, it's a trap! Quicker than you can say "here 
we go again," Ray's pal has a major new body piercing and our fisherman 
friend is chasing after Ray.</P>
<P>"I Know What You Did Last Summer" had a few qualities that raised it a 
notch or two above standard slasher fare. The dark murders were set 
against the background of a colorful small town festival and the contrast 
was refreshing. The kids were brighter than most denizens of slasher 
films and the mystery of the killer's identity livened things up somewhat.</P>
<P>"I Still Know" contains none of those elements. The film starts off grim 
and nasty and never wavers in tone. The Bahamian setting is murky and the 
action scenes lack a distinct sense of place. The supporting cast members 
are uniformly obnoxious and each primary actor has exactly one 
identifying characteristic, from which he or she never wavers.</P>
<P>Jennifer Love Hewitt is the most tiresome. She starts the film in a state 
of borderline hysteria, and the borderline soon disappears. Of course, 
the real star of the film isn't Hewitt, it's her breasts, which are 
featured so prominently in various form-fitting outfits that they almost 
deserve their own screen credit.</P>
<P>After the requisite false scares, the extremely bloody production settles 
into a repetitive, relentless groove, aping stylistic techniques from 
other genre films well enough to build some tension despite the 
inevitability of the story. If, after the first ten minutes of the film, 
you can't predict who will be alive at the conclusion, you're just not 
trying. </P>
<P>True to form, there is the mandatory plot twist towards the end, and the 
film's godawful closing scene offers the possibility for yet another 
sequel. The prospect of a third installment of this derivative series is 
much scarier than anything that happens in the movie. In 1997, "I Know 
What You Did Last Summer" was a surprise hit. Hopefully, audiences will 
be discerning enough to make "I Still Know" a surprise failure.</P>
