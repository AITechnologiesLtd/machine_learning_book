<P>Cranky Critic® movie reviews: Kirikou and  the Sorceress
Not  Rated, 71 minutes
Written by Michel Ocelot
Directed by Michel Ocelot with Raymond Burlet
website: www.kirikou.net</P>
<P>IN SHORT: An enchanting and delightful tale for kidlets and the li'l
kidlet inside.</P>
<P>How does this figure? A French Guinea born animator takes a West African
fairy tale, gets Peter Gabriel collaborator Youssou N'Dour to do the
music and delivers the whole thing in an English dub to four American
theaters where no one will see the thing. This is the curse of the indie
flick, folk, and this is one of the times I'll screech about something
that was delightful.</P>
<P>>From the first frame, you know that you're looking at a story that is,
to say the lease, unusual. A very pregnant African sits. A voice comes
from her belly saying "I am ready to be born now!" The soon to be mother
replies "Any child that says to me it is ready to be born can do it
himself" (I'm paraphrasing). So the kidlet crawls out of mom, snaps the
umbilical with his hands and proclaims to the world "I AM KIRIKOU!" and
walks away. Not only can he walk and talk, he can run at speeds akin to
The Flash of comic book fame. The kidlet is adorable and the film is
entrancing from the start.</P>
<P>Like all good fairy tales, there is an evil witch. In this case it is
the Sorceress Karaba, who lives in a hut outside the village. Nearly all
the male warriors of the village disappeared, presumed dead, after going
off to fight her. Karaba's lust is for all the gold of the village, and
her demands are constant. Kirikou decides that he will end the threat of
the Sorceress and, even more, discover why she hates the village so. It
is a question that no one has thought to ask.</P>
<P>Again, like the good fairy tales, Kirikou gets help. From the plants and
animals of the local forest. From a mystic wise man who lives at the end
of a very dangerous trek through territory controlled by Karaba. With
the knowledge he has gained, Kirikou's final confrontation with the
sorceress is quite surprising.</P>
<P>The animation keeps the African feel of the story. The Masai natives are
dressed according to their style (think National Geographic) but there
is no sexual implication that could concern parents of tiny kidlets.
N'Dour's music is a perfect complement to the story and, darn it, this
kidlet is plain out adorable.</P>
<P>I can't tell you much about this flick. It's distribution is almost nil.
Even if you have to search it out on tape, 'toonheads will want to see
this beautifully told tale which, like all archetypal folk tales, finds
its parallels in fables like Androcles and the Lion and intellectual
explanations by Joseph Campbell. Long time readers know Cranky eats that
stuff for breakfast, which means I walked out of the screening as one
happy camper.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Kirikou and the Sorceress, he would
have paid...</P>
<PRE>$7.00</PRE>
<P>That release schedule I've got puts Kirikou and the Sorceress in New
York on February 18, Chicago on March 10 and Northern California on
March 24. Other than that, read the fine print in your newspapers.
Badger your video stores. Find this flick.</P>
