<P>We've already seen kids play James Bond this year in Spy Kids - now it's
time for the family pet to don high-tech gear and battle the bad guys.  And
if there's anything more visually pleasing than a talking dog using
binoculars, I don't want to know what it is.  Cats and Dogs ranks somewhere
between Shrek and Atlantis for summer family-film enjoyment.  The story
barely matters, and it smartly takes a backseat to the picture's
surprisingly well-done special effects.</P>
<P>I know, I know - you're all thinking, "We've just seen a cruddy movie about
talking animals with Eddie Murphy, and the last decent family film with
talking dogs and cats was Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey, and that's
so old, Michael J. Fox wasn't even shaking yet."  Well, you're right, and
what's more, Cats is violent and mean-spirited, to boot.  But it's a whole
lot of fun, and the kids at my screening sure seemed to enjoy the hell out
it.</P>
<P>The film opens with an impressive chase scene between a dog and cat that
culminates in the dog being "catnapped" by a gang of ferocious felines that
work for the fiendishly evil Mr. Tinkles (voiced by Sean Hayes, Will and
Grace).  What, you may ask yourselves, would a cat who is hell-bent on
taking over the world want with a mangy old pooch?  It's simple:  The dog
was really an undercover special agent protecting a scientist (Jeff
Goldblum, Holy Man) and his cutting-edge research on a dog allergy formula.
If Professor Brody succeeds, dogs will remain at the right hand of their
masters.  If the cats are able to sabotage the project, they'll take over
the human race, just like they did in ancient Egypt.  (Don't ask me - I told
you the story took a backseat to the effects, remember?)</P>
<P>The undercover dog agents (whose motto is "To Fetch and Protect") try to get
one of their own into the Brody household to defend the professor's work,
but a rather moronic Beagle puppy named Lou (Tobey Maguire, Wonder Boys)
becomes the new family pet instead.  Lou has dreamt of exciting adventures
but has no formal dog militia training, which means he gets his ass kicked
by a pair of Ninja cats before his superior (Alec Baldwin, Pearl Harbor) can
show Lou how to take care of himself.  Holy shit!  Is it a sign of the
apocalypse when the dog voiced by Baldwin looks just like Baldwin?  That's
one creepy dog.</P>
<P>There are a few other decent celebrity voices in Cats, like Susan Sarandon,
Michael Clarke Duncan, Joe Pantoliano and Jon Lovitz (wait - is he still a
celebrity?).  Like Shrek, there's a lot of inside adult humor, too, like
when one dog exclaims in frustration, "Son of my mother!"  The bit with the
Russian cat is priceless, as is the best soccer spoof since The Simpsons
went to the Mexico v. Portugal match.  It's all kind of surprising,
considering the script is from a couple of guys with no feature-film
experience (John Requa and Glenn Ficarra), and it's directed by a
first-timer, too (Lawrence Guterman)..</P>
