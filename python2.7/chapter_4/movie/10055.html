<P>Doug Draizin and Anna Marie Davis, co-producers of "Fools Rush In"
manage to put together a spirited and beguiling romantic comedy based
on a true story; apparently their own.</P>
<P>Whether their meeting happened exactly as the movie shows is probably
the least of the concerns of the average moviegoer, who probably won't
even know this little tidbit, which, incidentally might serve them well
in the next movie trivia pursuit they partake in. What they will be
aware of is the chemistry between the two leads, as well as the lively
banter between their best friends, and the overall sweetness and fluid
direction of "Fools."</P>
<P>"Friends" fanatic will immediately recognize Alex Whitman as Matthew
Perry, though the more devout Perry fan will no doubt see him as
"Chandler Bing" on on the big screen. That's not a bad thing, since He
often has the funniest moments in the sit-com. Perry's character is
little more than Chandler on the big screen but the antics and dry
sarcasm that make him the most popular male on the TV show works well
in this movie. He is well supported by the sensual Salma Hayek, whose
presence bellies her otherwise petite frame (she's 5'2").</P>
<P>The fun starts in New York where we're introduced to a career-driven
Whitman, who works for a NY-based night club construction firm, who
ends up with a gig to oversee construction of a ritzy night club right
on the Vegas Strip. The viewer gets an inital taste of his quick wit
which is the source of much of the entertainment throughout the movie.
It's this style of verbal humor that allows Perry to pull off seemingly
innocuous lines into amusing zingers. The film is riddled with lines
like "gee that sounded so much prettier in Spanish." Lines that would
sound otherwise ordinary with any other actor.</P>
<P>During his first few nights in Vegas, while standing in line for a
unisex bathroom is where he comes across the spunky Isabel Fuentes, a
beautiful photographer of Mexican decent. After their initial
encounter, the director cuts immediately to the morning after of their
one-night stand where we see her wake up next to a dozing Alex and gets
that all-too-familiar "Oh my God" look.</P>
<P>Therein lies the turning point. Three months later, she shows up and
tells Alex she's pregnant, with his child. We're treated to a short yet
amusing spiel from Alex about a condom's reason for being. Distraught,
she leaves, he chases her wanting to help and ends up that same evening
eating at her parent's place for a family dinner. Apparently her idea
of "family" involves cousins, aunts, uncle and probably the Mormon
Tabernacle Choir. Alex on the other hand, visits his parents only
during "holidays and stuff."</P>
<P>Alex manages to enjoy himself immensely, so much so that he decides he
and Isabelle should get married. The proposal itself is a riot, with
him proclaiming "you're everything I never knew I always wanted." Both
poignant and hilarious, even Isabelle displays amusement, albeit a
slight bewildered smile. In typical Vegas fashion, they get married in
a chapel with Elvis as a witness.</P>
<P>More hilarity ensues when Alex's parents (played by Jill Clayburgh and
John Bennet Perry, Matthew's real  father) decide to make a surprise
visit. Being the quintessential New York WASP-ish type, they initially
mistake Isabel for a housekeeper. They do find out and she's actually a
wife, and agree to a parent meeting. The cultural difference issues
that seem to be so prevalent throughout the movie is shown here with a
deft touch by Tennant, the most entertaining being the back and forth
between the two fathers.</P>
<P>As with most marriages there will be conflicts, the fights and make-ups
are also done in ways that are easily believable. And while all this is
going on, we're treated to a bit of insight about the two leads from
the goings on around  them. Whether it's Alex's job, old crushes,
construction difficulties, jealous ex-boyfriends, or being surrounded
by snakes in the desert. Jon Tenney also provides some moments of humor
as Alex's libidinous, recently divorced best friend.</P>
<P>"Fools Rush In" is clearly blessed by the expert casting of the
romantic duo. You can almost feel the chemistry between Perry and Hayek
throughout the entire movie. Their acting and charm is what makes the
entire movie seem so real. Their relationship is well paced and
developed in a manner that is plausible considering their near-shotgun
wedding. Both are shown as real people having a real depth and
substance.</P>
<P>Tennant deserves a bit of the credit for his skilled direction. We're
treated to quite a few musical montages, as well several sweeping views
of Vegas, the Hoover Dam, and especially stunning scenes of the desert.
He does an especially good job of letting Hayek radiate through the
lens. The slow-motion shots of Isabel looking lovingly at Alex is
subtle yet but go so far in showing Hayek's sensuality. You can truly
read what's on her mind just by looking at her face.</P>
<P>"Fools" is an immensely enjoyable film, perfect for those romantic
evenings with a significant other. Its Valentine's Day release earlier
this year could not have been more perfect. Few romantic comedies
contain such a well-blended combination of humor, passion, and
believability. Check it out.</P>
