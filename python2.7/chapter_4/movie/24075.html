<PRE>THE CUP (G).  
(Dendy)

Lama, Kunsang Nyima, Pema Tshundup
Running time: 93 minutes.</PRE>
<P>There have been a number of recent films exploring the plight
of Tibet and the systematic destruction of its culture since the
Chinese invasion in 1959.  The Cup is another film to explore this
fertile territory, but it does so with a deceptive gentleness.</P>
<P>The action of The Cup takes place in a Tibetan
monastery-in-exile in the foothills of the Himalayas, where the monks
try to instil in their younger charges a sense of the traditions of
their ancient culture.  But the old ways are under siege from modern
influences - Coca Cola, and now the World Cup.</P>
<P>Thanks to the infectious enthusiasm of Orygen, a 14 year old
soccer fan, the whole monastery is slowly caught up in the excitement
and suspense of the 1998 world cup.  They plan to bring a television
and satellite dish into the monastery so that everyone can watch the
final.  Even Palden and Nyima, two novice monks smuggled out of
Chinese occupied Tibet to continue their studies, eventually become
involved in their efforts.  Gecko, the Abbott's respected offsider and
disciplinarian, observes the monks' fervent efforts to reconcile their
religious devotion with more secular activities with a mixture of
bemusement and humour.</P>
<P>The Cup is a simple story, beautifully and efficiently told.
The film explores themes of exile and the inevitability of change, and
draws a delightful contrast between the monks' efforts to teach
discipline and tradition to their charges and their pragmatic need to
embrace some elements of modern culture.  This unexpected gem of a
film also contains subtle political undercurrents, critical of the
continued Chinese occupation of Tibet.</P>
<P>The Cup is an unusual co-production between Australia and
Bhutan, a small Asian country not known for its film production.  The
Cup is also the first feature film from Khyentse Norbu, a monk with a
passion for film, who learnt his craft as a production assistant on
Bertolucci's Little Buddha.</P>
<P>Norbu has assembled his cast from amongst the monks at the
monastery where it was shot.  All of the performers here are new to
film, and have little understanding of English, but they are
intimately familiar with the characters they are playing.  The cast
were given their lines only hours before filming, with little time for
polishing their delivery.  However, the tentative and hesitant
approach of these non- professional actors is sometimes apparent.
Consequently they suffuse the material with a natural, spontaneous
feel, which somehow adds to the charm of this off beat but ultimately
endearing film.</P>
<P>In keeping with the international nature of the production,
Norbu has employed the talents of a largely Australian crew, with Paul
Warren's cinematography particularly striking.</P>
