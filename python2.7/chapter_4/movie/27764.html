<PRE>O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * * * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Joel Coen
Written by: Joel Coen, Ethan Coen, Homer (for "The Odyssey")</P>
<P>Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney) just broke free of a chain gang with 
two fellow prisoners, Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson). 
They plan on heading back to Ulysses' home town to recover 1.2 million 
dollars in stolen money (that's 5 hundred thousand each! Delmar happily 
exclaims) that Ulysses has buried. Little do they know their journey will 
take them through hazards and wonders aplenty. Before their journey ends, 
the trio will have encountered George "Baby Face" Nelson (Michael Badalucco) 
in the midst of one of his crime sprees; three sirens by the river who will 
attempt to seduce our heroes and have a habit of changing some men into 
amphibians; a one-eyed bible salesman named Big Dan Teague (John Goodman); a 
massive Ku Klux Klan rally; a heated race for the Governership between the 
angry Pappy O'Daniel (Charles Durning), and the jovial reform party 
candidate, Homer Stokes (Wayne Duvall); and Ulysses' wife, Penny (Holly 
Hunter), who is getting re-married since Ulysses was conveniently hit by a 
train without his knowing about it. The group will also meet up with a 
guitar player named Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas King) who sold his soul to 
the devil so he could play his guitar masterfully. Along with Tommy, the 
trio records a hit song under the assumed band name of "The Soggy Bottom 
Boys," but they're traveling so much they don't yet realize just what a hit 
it is.</P>
<P>"I never         met a Coen movie I didn't like," I told a friend of mine before 
heading out to see the brothers' latest flick. Even <i>Barton Fink</i>, with 
its plunge into utter nonsense at the half-way mark, kept me quite 
entertained. If you want to view that as a sign that I'm biased toward Coen 
movies and my opinion therefore counts for less than it normally would, go 
right ahead. If you're willing to accept my opinion, then let me sum it up 
this way: I loved this movie. Gee John, what a loquacious description. How 
long did it take you to think that one up? Well I'm sorry my friends, but 
unlike Ulysses Everett McGill and Big Dan Teague, I'm not blessed with the 
gift of gab. Besides, what did you expect me to do, sit here and ramble 
about the sheer beauty of every scene of this movie? Did you think I'd 
babble on and on about how I could watch this movie on mute just to gaze in 
awe at its sheer majesty, but then I'd miss the outstanding and highly 
amusing banter between the characters? That I'd talk about how the movie was 
funny, clever, good natured, and a great time all around? Well, if that's 
what you thought, you were obviously wrong. No, I think the words "I loved 
this movie" will do quite nicely on their own.</P>
<P>I've never fully understood why people like George Clooney so much. He 
always seemed afflicted by Nic Cage syndrome to me. In case you're 
wondering, that means he plays the exact same character with different 
names. This works at times, like it did in <i>Out of Sight</i>, but usually 
fails miserably, as exemplified in the horrendous <i>The Perfect Storm</i> 
and, even worse, in <i>Batman and Robin</i>. Imagine my surprise when I 
witnessed his truly hilarious, frankly Oscar worthy performance as the 
silver tongued Ulysses. I have to admit, this movie has given me a whole new 
appreciation for Clooney's acting talents. Of course, he's supported by a 
host of great actors. Long time Coen collaborator John Turturro is perfectly 
cast as the embittered Pete, while Tim Blake Nelson (<i>The Thin Red 
Line</i>) manages to turn the brainless Delmar into an endearingly naive and 
funny character. I tend to like John Goodman in everything, and though his 
appearance in <i>O Brother</i> is brief, it's quite funny and he's just the 
man for the role. Holly Hunter (<i>The Piano</i>) and Charles Durning 
(<i>I.Q.</i>) are given fairly small roles, but they makes their appearances 
memorable.</P>
<P>Who am I kidding? I feel a burning need to praise this movie up and down; 
but while I won't waste your valuable time doing that, I'll at least provide 
a touch more insight than "I love this movie." Reading the reviews before 
walking into the film, I had this sick feeling that I was about to witness 
the Coens' first failure. "It's dull!" The critics cried; "It's not funny!" 
"It makes fun of the south!" I must have seen a different movie. The one I 
saw may have been leisurely paced, but I was never bored, and I didn't look 
at my watch once. Not funny? Are you kidding me? Curious as to how they 
could feel that way, I went back and looked at a few of their reviews for 
<i>The Big Lebowski</i> (which I feel is the funniest movie of the '90s). 
Sure enough, they all hated that one too. My friends, if you enjoy the 
Coens' brand of quirky, subtle comedy, you'll find this movie to be a laugh 
riot. Otherwise, go watch <i>Dumb and Dumber</i> for the umpteenth time; I'm 
sure it hasn't lost any of its comic genius for you. As for the film making 
fun of the south, I'm not sure just what these critics were talking about. 
There's a little gentle prodding I suppose, but nothing remotely vicious. 
Even the scene involving a Ku Klux Klan rally is played for comedy (Klan 
members dance about in a very funny homage to <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>) 
rather than as an attack on the south for housing such groups. In fact, 
there's nothing remotely mean spirited about this movie. Damnit all you 
nay-sayers, I'm mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take this anymore.</P>
<P>It breaks my heart to say this, but I can't honestly recommend <i>O Brother, 
Where Art Thou?</i> to everyone. Like most Coen brothers movies, this one 
will only find its way into the hearts of a small group of people; typically 
those society describes as just a little... off. Why is that? Well, because 
it's come to my attention that American audiences tend to like their humor 
as in-your-face as possible (what else can explain the success of <i>Scary 
Movie</i>?), and the humor in <i>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</i> is as subtle 
as it can be. The second, and perhaps most important reason, is that the 
film is leisurely and pleasant. There's next to no action (aside from 
"Babyface" Nelson's bank robbery and car chase); and the film is filled will 
long sequences of the Coens' trademark wide, panning camera shots of the 
beautiful south. Sorry folks, but if that doesn't sound like your cup of 
tea, go catch Guy Ritchie's frantic film, <i>Snatch</i>, instead. It's 
probably best that I mention one more thing which could certainly be seen as 
a flaw. Animal lovers will probably be shocked and horrified at a few scenes 
like one where a toad gets squished, or one where a cow is plowed over 
during a high speed chase. If you're one of those people who can't handle 
the very idea of anything happening to an animal, this will probably disgust 
you. If you're like me, and you can realize it's not really happening to the 
animal, you should do just fine (if you're really sick, like me, you might 
even get a chuckle out of these scenes).</P>
<P>I'm pretty sure someone will shoot me if I don't mention the film's 
soundtrack, and that someone could very well be me. So, here's the 
soundtrack description for ya: it's old, it's southern, it's country, it's 
twangy, and it's brilliant. That's coming from a guy who doesn't normally 
like anything resembling country music. I bought the soundtrack the day 
after I saw the movie, and not just for the outstanding song by the Soggy 
Bottom Boys, "I am a Man of Constant Sorrow." Granted, that song will be 
stuck in your head for days, but the entire soundtrack is simply brilliant. 
>From the Sirens' song, to the beautiful and haunting "O Death", this 
soundtrack makes me wonder one thing: how did this sort of deep roots, 
lovely music give way to the moronic country and pop rock of today? <i>O 
Brother, Where Art Thou?</i> runs a leisurely, gentle 106 minutes, and I 
treasured every moment of it. I'd recommend the film to fans of George 
Clooney since he really shines this time around, and to fans of the Coen 
brothers who will probably appreciate the film's quirky humor. I give the 
movie a much deserved four and a half out of five stars.</P>
