<PRE>                             THE SIXTH SENSE
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Another week in '99, another horror film.  But will THE SIXTH SENSE
really scare you?  Despite the title that is more reminiscent of
LEPRECHAUN than THE EXORCIST, this is a genuinely creepy film with a
solid story, great acting, and a surprise ending that not even a jaded
critic like me saw coming.</P>
<P>     The concept is that young Cole Sear (Osment) sees ghosts, and they
torment him night and day, to the point of physical abuse.  Desperate
for help, he eventually hooks up with brilliant child psychologist
Malcolm Crowe (Willis), who tries to help him out.</P>
<P>     Meanwhile, Cole's mom (Collette) and Malcolm's wife Anna (Williams)
have problems of their own relating to the men in their lives.  While
these subplots are a bit sketchy at first, they do serve a purpose,
coming full circle by the end of the picture.</P>
<P>     Writer/director Shyamalan has a few credits under his belt (nothing
I've ever seen, though), but his skill at combining the supernatural
with the everyday here is pretty well-done, and is largely without
intense special effects.  As for acting, Willis actually does a credible
job with his part, for the first time since 12 MONKEYS (1995).</P>
<P>     Osment -- previously seen as Forrest Gump Jr. in FORREST GUMP, as
the kid in the underrated BOGUS, and as Murphy Brown's son -- is stellar
in his role.  Although he over-enunciates to an extreme, he's an
excellent actor, and I hope that will carry over to his adult roles
later in life.</P>
<P>     THE SIXTH SENSE is still a horror/thriller at its heart, so don't
expect it to win any great flood of awards.  But it's a solid film and
the work of a meticulous writer, which is a rare pleasure these days.</P>
