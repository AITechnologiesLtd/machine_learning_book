<PRE>Playing God
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1997 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>* (Out of ****)</PRE>
<P>One would think that David Duchovny, star of the cult favorite "X-Files"
would be very careful in choosing his leading man cinema roles. At least one
would hope so. One would be seriously incorrect.</P>
<P>Eugene Sands (Duchovny) is a surgeon so dedicated to his craft that he
becomes addicted to amphetamines to stay awake and work more. It turns out to
be a bad plan when he loses a patient and his license while under the influence.</P>
<P>Ten months later, in a seedy bar to score synthetic heroin, the doctor gets a
chance to ply his trade when assassins gun down a customer. Using a plastic
water bottle and bar tubing, Sands operates and saves his life. Smalltime
hoodlum Raymond Blossom (Timothy Hutton) is impressed with the cutlery skills
on his associate. He kidnaps and then offers down-and-out Eugene a position in
his organization.</P>
<P>Blossom needs a doctor to patch up gunshot victims that would be problematic
at a hospital. Sand's temptation is that this will give him a chance to
practice medicine again albeit illegally, big chunks of cash to fuel his habit
and close proximity to the gangster's womanfriend Claire (Angelina Jolie),
this film's babe factor.</P>
<P>The would-be big time operator is desperately in need of help. On the run
from Russian mobsters (the bad guys that seem to be all the rage in this
year's films) and trying to cut a pirate software deal with the Chinese Mafia,
Blossom is surrounded by blood.</P>
<P>After a few medical misadventures, the physician grows disenchanted with his
employment. An encounter with a couple of psycho surfer dudes who threaten to
blow him away unless he "fixes" their dead buddy cements his feeling that he
is in the wrong line of work. When the FBI visits and forces him to become an
informant, there is no question that he needs to be somewhere else.</P>
<P>Oddly enough, these seem like they could be exciting scenes. The film
disproves that assumption.</P>
<P>Then a bunch of other uninteresting things happen. Writing this only two days
after seeing the film, its a struggle to remember the events. You can take
that as a solid lack of recommendation.</P>
<P>For all the coolness that Duchovny exhibits in "X-Files", it's a surprise
that his big screen presence is so lacking in charisma. The doctor is
particularly bland and dull. Even the cold turkey bit which is rife with
dramatic possibilities come across as banal. A little chocolate and minor
sweats get him through heroin withdrawal. Like virtually everything else in
the film, it's a missed opportunity. The Fox Mulder detachment doesn't work here.</P>
<P>Oscar-winner Hutton's manic mobster is much more difficult to get a handle
on. Played partially for comedy and partially as crazed killer, Blossom almost
becomes real, but then sinks into goofiness. Most of the time Hutton looks as
if he's searching for his character and coming up empty.</P>
<P>Jolie also makes a few false moves towards creating a three-dimensional human
being before giving up and turning into scenery. The most interesting aspect
of her performance is watching her pouty lips threaten to take over the screen.</P>
<P>The rest aren't any better. Michael Massee's eccentric FBI agent never revs
up. One of Blossom's henchmen steals a few moments of the show as a quirky
gunman reminiscent of Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday in "Tombstone". His
two-gunned blasting as he does a bizarre dance is the high point of the film.
But that 15 seconds isn't worth sitting through the other 90 minutes.</P>
<P>First time film director Andy Wilson (known for his work on the British
television series "Cracker") appears to be attempting to jump on the
"Pulp Fiction" bandwagon. The best of these movies combine a sense of
style and flash with significant substance. The second-rate ones concentrate
on just one of these aspects. "Playing God" does neither well.</P>
<P>The basic idea of the film is solid. And then it goes nowhere. Even worse, it
plods back and forth, up and down a long and winding road before it ends up
nowhere. Fox fails yet again in his search for intelligent life.</P>
<P>(After over 22 years of writing this column, Michael Redman is still shocked
when good actors and a sound premise combine to create a wretched film. You'd
think he'd learn. Lesson plans can be sent to <A HREF="mailto:mredman@bvoice.com">mredman@bvoice.com</A> )</P>
