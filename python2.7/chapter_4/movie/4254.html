<PRE>             THE INCREDIBLY TRUE ADVENTURES OF TWO GIRLS IN LOVE
                       A film review by Wendy Betts
                        Copyright 1995 Wendy Betts</PRE>
<P>Written and directed by Maria Maggenti
Starring Laurel Hollomon and Nicole Parker</P>
<P>     As sweet and refreshing as a frosty glass of lemonade, this is a
lovely little movie that leaves the heart both warmed and aching.  It's
a tender, very funny, utterly sincere look at first love for two
teenagers who seem to have nothing in common--except that they're both
girls.   Randy, who lives with her aunt in a poor but happy lesbian
household, is a social outcast, failing in school; Evie is rich,
intellectual and popular.  The fact that Randy is white and Evie is
black is the least of their problems.</P>
<P>     The inevitable culture conflicts that arise when Randy and Evie
fall in love are played largely for laughs, as when Evie comes out to
her utterly vapid friends, who advise her to try and rent that movie
about the two girls who went to the prom, and a marvelous slapstick
scene in which the two girls are caught in bed by Evie's mother, who's
far more freaked out about the mess they made of her house than about
her daughter having sex.  But the often broad humor takes nothing away
from what the story is really about: falling in love. The typical
cliches of first love are shown here with such warmth and charm that
they seem newly fresh and unique--just as they do in real life when
people fall in love.  The girls playing Randy and Evie were so
believable that I felt a little embarrassed during a tender scene in
which they make love for the first time; although respectfully and
fairly modestly filmed, it seemed too personal for a stranger to be
watching.</P>
<P>     Both comic and romantic, naturally THE INCREDIBLY TRUE ADVENTURES
OF TWO GIRLS IN LOVE is a "feel-good" kind of movie, an accolade it
deserves far more than many slicker, more professional films.  But
although Evie and Randy's problems as a lesbian couple are treated
lightly, they're an undercurrent that can never be totally
disregarded.  The ending of the film doesn't offer a perfect
resolution, but poignantly symbolizes both the difficulty any
mismatched lovers have of shutting out the censorious voices of the
world, and the fact that it is still worth trying.</P>
