<P>Rating: * * * * out of * * * *  
Starring: Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, Olivia Williams, Toni Collete.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13 for intense thematic elements and violent images.</P>
<P>Not one movie I have seen in my life, has made me feel the way I felt when I
saw the newest classic 'The Sixth Sense'. A strikingly original movie that at
first glance seems like a horror film with many chills, turns into a
unexpectedly movie drama with a surprising ending. The acting in the film was
incredible especially by young Osment who gives one of the best performances of
the year. Bruce Willis is perfectly cast, as well as Toni Collete and Olivia
Williams. </P>
<P>Haley Joel Osment plays Cole a young, smart boy plagued by images of dead
people still walking around. No one knows his secret but him, and he is
destined not to tell anyone. When child psychiatrist Malcolm (Bruce Willis)
finds out about the boy, he wants to help him. Naturally Cole is afraid and
scared to tell anyone even his mother played by Toni Collete. He and Malcolm
become good friends and Cole finally tells him about his 'sixth sense' and
seeing dead people. Although Malcolm's personal life with his wife becomes on
the rocks, he still tries to help the young boy and see what the illness is. At
first he doesn't believe him and thinks Cole is having visual hallucinations,
but after he thinks about what happened a year before he starts to believe Cole
leading to an ending that's not only shocking but very moving.</P>
<P>A different movie experience all together. With disturbing images of ghosts
walking around and terrorizing young Cole, it is extremely scary sometimes, but
most of the time it's a psychological drama that stems from the acting it has
in it, and the direction it was made with. Haley Joel Osment is excellent as
the young boy, and deserves all the credit he can get in this role that should
make him famous. His images of ghosts are not only believable but will give you
a new outlook on what ghosts are and what they are doing here. Bruce Willis
gives one of his most endearing and believable performances to date, who with
Osment make a great on-screen duo.</P>
<P>Toni Collete as Cole's mother gives a wonderful female performance and deserves
as well all the credit she can get. Olivia Williams who was so good in
'Rushmore' also gives a great performance. Being written and directed by M.
Night Shyamalan, this is a pure work of genius, nothing more nothing less. A
movie like this deserves to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar as well as
Screenplay and acting. </P>
<P>When you see this one, be sure to listen and understand it completely. It's not
a horror movie it's a sad, drama really with some scary parts. It means alot to
some people, it got down somewhere in me that no other movie before has. To put
it another way 'The Sixth Sense' is one of the best movie of this year.</P>
