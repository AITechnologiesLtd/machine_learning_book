<PRE>WILD AMERICA</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: **1/2 (out of ****) </PRE>
<P>Warner Bros. / 1:46 / 1997 / PG (animal violence and intensity, language)
Cast: Jonathan Taylor Thomas; Devon Sawa; Scott Bairstow; Jamey Sheridan; 
Frances Fisher 
Director: William Dear 
Screenplay: David Michael Wieger </P>
<P>A kiddie nature adventure where the special effects aren't too special, 
"Wild America" is more "When Fake Animals Attack" than a "National 
Geographic" special. But it's no painful sit -- this entertaining, if 
uninvolving, yarn does more than a few things right, starting with a 
nice, hokey setup and some rather interesting main characters. Whenever 
the sights cause unintentional hilarity, there are usually assets to fall 
back on. And when there's not ... well, everyone can use a good chuckle 
now and then.</P>
<P>"Wild America" takes place in 1967 and charts a summer in the early lives 
of the Stouffer siblings, a trio of Arkansas brothers who would 
eventually become wildlife photographers for the nature program that 
shares its name with the film. At 18, Marty (appealing Scott Bairstow) is 
the eldest, locking horns with their trucker dad (Jamey Sheridan) over 
future career paths. Vain, 16-year-old Mark (Devon Sawa, frequently 
shirtless for some reason) can't get enough of the ladies. And baby bro 
Marshall (Home Improvement's Jonathan Taylor Thomas), who's 12, is very 
much a dreamer. Manned with a brand new camera, all three take off on a 
cross-country tour to capture exclusive footage of endangered species, 
but don't stop to consider the danger they're placing themselves in. </P>
<P>A meatier budget could have helped things considerably -- it's hard to 
get excited over some of the creature contact when the animals are 
obviously phony. A runaway moose hoists Marshall up on its antlers for a 
wild ride, but it looks too artificial. The same can be said for a run-in 
with supposedly-venomous rattlesnakes. And the movie's nature-set climax, 
where the boys stumble into a bear den (hibernating in the heat?) and 
wake its occupants up, falls flat on its face thanks to -- yep, you 
guessed it -- actors in furry suits. A "Mystery Science Theater 3000" 
interlude would have been much appreciated amidst all of this weirdness. 
And speaking of weird, wait'll you see Danny Glover's peculiar turn as a 
crazy mountain man! </P>
<P>While large chunks of "Wild America" are dopey -- and some even too 
heavy-handed (there's needless "spiritual" filler involving a pet owl and 
a destined plane ride) -- the movie still clicks as a honest showcase for 
three fine young actors and nice wildlife footage; clips from the 
Stouffers' real movies are even shown during the end credits, and are 
worth sticking around for. The situations that Bairstow, Sawa and Thomas 
are put into don't always ring true, but their camaraderie feels right, 
and elevates the film past such recent family-oriented fare as "Far From 
Home: The Adventures of Yellow Dog" and "Alaska." "Wild America" 
certainly means well, and the story holds enough promise to keep you 
diverted, if never fully satisfied.</P>
