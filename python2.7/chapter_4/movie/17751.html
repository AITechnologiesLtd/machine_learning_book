<P>Possible Gap product placements in "The Matrix": Khakis Explode?  Khakis
Virtual?  CyberKhaki?  In fact, there's a perfect moment to yell out
"khakis?" in a crowded movie theater: soon after Lawrence Fishburn
says, "You can get anything you want," that's the right time.  MST3K
could not have asked for a better lead.</P>
<P>Actually, the movie isn't MST3K fodder, beyond the usual quota of Keanu
moments; these pass quickly, though they're worth a few chuckles
("Keanu Fu").  Perhaps the best way to describe "The Matrix" as a movie
is to say it's some sort of live action Japanese anime.  You have the
hyperkinetic martial arts, the bad-ass pose downs for which the movie
lives, the impossible body dynamics of being tossed at a brick wall or
leaping gulfs, perhaps even a large-eyed woman if you use a little
imagination with Carrie-Ann Moss.  It's a fun, mindless action movie,
featuring the aforementioned Martial Arts Plus, prodigious amounts of
ammunition, and Quake-like charge-into-big-room-and-shoot-everyone
video game violence.  What more can you ask for?</P>
<P>Beyond style and action, I'm not sure what else to say.  Keanu's
character appears to have no past, so that's an indication of his
alienation from this world?  All the eye imagery and the sunglasses
indicate how strongly the world is based on perception?  I'm sure that
we can come up with lit crit that talks about the eye symbolism in this
movie, and the focus on sunglasses, mirrored or otherwise, and how
Agent Smith's pupils are apparently manipulated during the
interrogation scene to be more square than round.  But, you know, I
think all the sunglasses are there to look cool, and they're just
showing how Smith is the evil automaton he is.  Anyway, sunglasses go
with the black leather bad ass look.  That's what we're aiming for.  No
need for anyone to say, "hey, you're driving at night, take the glasses
off!"</P>
<P>Yes, they do try for the Deep Thought at times.  The primary one is the
Information Age update of Plato's Parable of the Cave.  When Fishburn
describes the nature of reality and his efforts of freeing others from
the illusions of life, his speech is almost lifted from the Cliff Notes
on "The Republic".  The notion of the world as shadow play on cave
walls is, of course, an old, rich science fiction vein; many have been
there before for ideas, and many will be there later.  No one is really
expecting "The Matrix" to break new SF ground, and in fact the various
"the Matrix is this, the Matrix is that" speeches that Fishburn gives
are repetitive (well, Keanu isn't the brightest) and bog down the
film.  A good ten or twenty minutes can be cut from the middle, and no
one would notice.</P>
<P>Oh, the link between The Matrix and the Gap khaki ads goes one step
beyond the large blank white rooms where some of the action takes
place.  There's also marriage of computer and camera, with the
augmented overcranking and the virtual camera tricks that make the
freeze-and-rotate effects possible [1].  The Matrix, as noted, is a
visual marvel.</P>
