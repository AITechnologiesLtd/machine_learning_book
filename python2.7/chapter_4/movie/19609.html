Capsule Review, July 27, 1999.</P>
<P>Robert DeFranco's minor indie film, "Telling You," which came and went in a 
handful of platform theaters before being shipped off to video has a 
surprising array of young stars, most of which are put to no good use. Phil 
(Peter Facinelli) and Dennis (Dash Mihok) are two recent college graduates 
who work at a pizza place together and are unsure of what they are going to 
do with their life, questioning some of the things they may have done 
differently. If "Telling You" had concentrated on the characters, the film 
may have worked, as the performances are fairly good, particularly by Mihok 
and Gina Philips, as Mihok's ex-girlfriend from high school, and one 
flawlessly written and subtle scene between the two late in the picture 
almost saves it. Alas, the film gets bogged down in cliches and amateurish 
overplotting, with the other central character's (Phil) plight left 
frustratingly hanging. Jennifer Love Hewitt, the biggest star in the cast, 
has a throwaway, one-dimensional role as Phil's bubbly, talkative ex, but she 
does her best with what she's given, which is next to nothing.</P>
