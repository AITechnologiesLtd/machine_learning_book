<PRE>HANNIBAL (2001)
Reviewed by Jerry Saravia
October 10th, 2001</PRE>
<P>Ridley Scott's "Hannibal" has been criticized for its over-the-top gross out
scenes and little else. There is a reason for this - there is little else to
discuss and that is unfortunate. For all the character development that "The
Silence of the Lambs" provided for Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling,
"Hannibal" focuses on cartoonish types in a freak show designed to titillate, a
far cry from what "Silence" accomplished. </P>
<P>"Hannibal" begins effectively as we observe Clarice (Julianne Moore, replacing
Jodie Foster) on a drug raid with the help of several FBI agents. She kills a
drug czar (Hazelle Goodman) by firing a bullet at her chest as she clutches her
baby. The incident puts Clarice in a difficult position with the FBI as she has
to turn over her gun and badge. She is on the Guiness Book of World Records for
being the only FBI female agent to have the most kills. This Clarice, ten years
after dealing with Hannibal Lecter face-to-face, is a changed woman, colder and
less emotional. Probably a dose of good old Hannibal is just what she needs to
get out of her slump. Still, another agent named Krendler (Ray Liotta) has it in
for Clarice, and desires her sexually. As always, Clarice's interests in life
exclude anything sexual. One funny scene shows Krendler looking at photos of
Lecter unaware Clarice is watching him. She alerts him and he asks, "What are
you doing in the dark?" Her response: "Thinking of cannibalism." </P>
<P>So far, so good. "Hannibal" then switches to Florence, Italy where the good
doctor Lecter resides and is trying to find a job as a museum curator! A
detective named Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) is investigating the disappearance of
the former curator and discovers that the doctor is Hannibal and is on the FBI
ten most wanted list (which also includes the terrorist Bin Laden)! </P>
<P>The film's pacing slackens, spending far too much time on the Italian detective
and so little on Clarice who is still looking for Hannibal. Keeping the two most
memorable characters in the history of movies apart amounts to awkwardly
patched-together situations that have little to do with anything. In fact, as
written by David Mamet and Steven Zaillian, the story is almost nonexistent.
There is no tension, no surprise and a general lack of credibility. How can
someone like Hannibal, who never wears a disguise, be able to move about Italy
in a flowing cape and a hat and not be noticed? How can you not notice someone
wiping the glasses of wine they drink from at a restaurant? Well, the detective
notices but surely there must have some way of him communicating this
information to the FBI if he wanted to. </P>
<P>Of course, Pazzi chooses not to as his primary motive is financial. You see a
certain billionaire by the name of Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) wants Hannibal fed
to his killer boars. It turns out that Verger was forced to slice off his own
face and feed it to his dogs thanks to Hannibal. Now he is a faceless cipher
with no eyelids and a horrifying expression that is sure to creep out the most
jaded viewer. He is about as loony as Hannibal himself and provides a handsome
reward to anyone who knows of  Hannibal's whereabouts. Enter the desperate
Pazzi, yet he doesn't realize he is being hounded by Hannibal.  </P>
<P>But none of this matters in the least. There is no sense of urgency since
Hannibal can escape and elude authorities so easily. The crux of the film is the
Florence investigation but I missed the central relationship between Hannibal
and Clarice - they so embodied "Silence of the Lambs" that here, they are mostly
left on the sidelines. No character shadings or depth to either one of them
leaves us out in the cold. A real shame since Julianne Moore is an excellent
replacement for Jodie Foster, and a brief meeting between her and Hannibal sheds
little light on either one of them. </P>
<P>Another factor is that Hannibal was imprisoned in "Silence" thus leaving plenty
of time to understand his motives and desires, and his developing interest in
Clarice. Letting him loose like a wild animal does little to raise our
expectations - he is simply a madman with an insatiable appetite for flesh who
has a host of sardonic comments to make about cannibalism. Where is the charm
and elegance Hopkins brought to the original? </P>
<P>Moore is well-cast and strong and empathetic but she still remains as one-note
as Hopkins does. It is not her fault, the script needed plenty of fine-tuning
but what can you say about two top-of-the-class screenwriters hired to provide
such a mediocre, rambling screenplay? </P>
<P>"Hannibal" looks and sounds terrific thanks to director Ridley Scott. It is
glossy filmmaking but with no soul or human interest. A climactic dinner
sequence remains as loathsome and gory a sequence as anything Hollywood has ever
produced before (though Scott has directed it tastefully). But mean-spiritedness
and gore are central to "Hannibal" - it is a bloodless freak show where the
characters are all cartoons. "Silence of the Lambs" defied genre expectations by
never quite fitting into a thriller mode or a horror movie scenario - it was, at
its best, a psychological character study with a gripping hold on the audience
through its sheer intensity and surefire direction by Jonathan Demme. This film
is a pure slasher flick, unengaging and uneven. And all poor old Hannibal has
left to say are such flat one-liners like "Goody-goody" and "Ta-da." How rude!</P>
