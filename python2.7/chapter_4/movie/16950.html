<PRE>                             SHE'S ALL THAT
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Well, as it turns out, she's *not* all that.  She's like half
that.  Maybe less.  I'd say 30 percent that.</P>
<PRE>     70 percent crap.</PRE>
<P>     The way I ended up at SHE'S ALL THAT is because my wife refused to
go see 8MM, thus sticking us with this little flick, which she figured I
wouldn't mind seeing on account of the girls with large bazongas.  And
she is right: In point of fact, I do not mind seeing girls with large
bazongas, especially when they shake 'em on the dance floor.</P>
<P>     Said shaking is done on Prom Night, six weeks after Zach (Prinze)
is poised to win a bet in which he is tasked with turning uber-dork
Laney (Cook) into a teenage goddess.  And Zach does some damn fine
work.  You see, Laney's mom has died, and she's a bit of a nut job on
account of being the only woman in the family and having Kevin Pollack
as a dad.  Zach's got his own troubles, too: He can't choose between
attending Dartmouth, Yale, or Harvard... *or* he might wanna be a
hacky-sack performance artist!  (This is not a joke.)</P>
<P>     *Of course* Laney and Zach help each other through all this rabid
insanity!  But Laney finds out about the bet and - the horror - she gets
mad at Zach and goes to the prom with someone else!  Could their
blossoming relationship be doomed?  Well, you'll just have to get
yourself to the theater for that answer!</P>
<P>     Okay, there are a few chuckles, but I can count them all on one
hand.  That Prom Night shaking is also the best-choreographed prom I've
ever seen, and that includes all the ones on 90210.  But overall, this
movie's a loser.  As far as teen comedy/romances go... well, Molly
Ringwald is probably turning over in her grave.</P>
<PRE>     Er, wait a second.</PRE>
