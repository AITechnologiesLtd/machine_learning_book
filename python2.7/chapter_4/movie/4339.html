<PRE>                                  TOY STORY
                       A film review by Thomas Wheeler
                        Copyright 1995 Thomas Wheeler</PRE>

<P>     A lot of hoopla has been made about the fact that this film is the
first one ever done entirely on computer.  Fine and well, but I am one
of those people who remains decidedly concerned about computers
becoming too much a part of society (so naturally I'm writing on the
Internet, right?!).  Computer technology is a *tool*, in essence and
basic form no different than a screwdriver or a hammer  just a little
more sophisticated.  Ultimately, by its very nature, computer
technology is mindless, heartless, and soulless and so are many of the
people, I suspect, whose lives revolve completely around it.  I don't
care how advanced the technology gets (and the producers of this movie
are already claiming that within  two years it will be outmoded, and I
don't doubt it), this basic aspect of the technology will NEVER change.</P>
<P>     Will the fact that within a few short years the technology that
made this movie possible make this movie any less enjoyable?  I hardly
think so.  The writers and producers of the film have prepared a story
with a good deal of human warmth, conflict, drama, and no shortage of
humor, centering on a world which we have never seen before  the hidden
world of toys.</P>
<P>     Yes, maybe those toys of yours that seemed to have lives of their
own--really did!  What we have here are intelligent, adult characters
whose occupation is essentially to be a toy!  The conflict comes from
the fact that the favorite toy in Andys Room, a talking pull-string
sheriff doll named Woody, has some new competition, a sleek,
push-button talking science-fiction character named Buzz Lightyear.
Buzz has a few problems of his own, though.  Its not until well into
the movie that he realizes he *is* a toy, and it throws him into a deep
depression, until Woody convinces him that being a toy is actually a
pretty good job.</P>
<P>     Of course, by this time, the two have been captured by the
neighbors kid  a sadistic whelp named Sid who likes to blow up his toys
with firecrackers, and rebuild the parts into horrible plastic
abominations.  Worse still, Buzz and Woodys kid, Andy, and his family,
are moving the next day!  The remainder of the adventure, and I wont
give it away for those of you who haven't seen it, focuses on Buzz and
Woody getting away from Sid and making their way back to Andy.  Its a
great adventure that I highly recommend.</P>
<P>     Just one word of warning: don't go to see it just for the
technical aspects of it.  Sure, the computer animation is highly
impressive.  And maybe it *will* be outmoded in a couple of years, but
this movie *won't* be, and neither will the very *human* talent and
imagination that *really* made this movie possible, and thats something
no computer will *ever* be able to accomplish!</P>
