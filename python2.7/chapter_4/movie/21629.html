OSTRE SLEDOVANÉ VLAKY
(CLOSELY OBSERVED TRAINS)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Few weeks ago our national television have premiered BETTER
TOMORROW, and official TV guides had labelled this film as
American. Of course, even the most ignorant people would
hardly mistake Hong Kong for American federal state so this
move should be explained as an attempt to draw as many
audience to TV sets as possible. General audience today
perceives only American films to be worth watching. Few
decades ago it was the same, but there were few dissenting
voices that were pointing the fact that non-American films
can be entertaining too, and some of them even superior to
Hollywood products. One of the best arguments for that is
the Czech cinema. Even the Communism couldn't prevent Czechs
from creating films that later turned out to be pleasant
viewing experience for the audience outside festival
circles. There were two areas that brought fame to Czech
cinema - children's films and comedies. In the case of the
latter, it was mostly due to the fact that Communist rulers
of Czechoslovakia discouraged film-makers from creating
serious films about obvious shortcomings of their socialist
utopia. However, the long tradition of Czech humour, forged
through the centuries of foreign rule, proved to be too big
challenge even for the most diligent censors. Czech
comedies, with their focus on the ordinary life of
individuals, used indirect approach to criticise the state
of the society in general. That approach was somewhat less
indirect in early to mid 1960s, when the wave of
liberalisation, that would culminate in Prague Spring,
created some of the most successful and memorable films in
the history of Czech cinema. One of such films is CLOSELY
OBSERVED TRAINS, 1966 comedy by Jiri Menzel, which won
"Oscar" for best foreign film.</P>
<P>Plot of the film, based on the short story by Bohumil
Hrabal, is set in Autumn of 1944. Bohemia is occupied by
Nazis, but not for long, because Germany is losing on all
fronts. But the prospect of liberation doesn't seem to
bother ordinary people, at least those employed in
Kostomlaty rail station. One of them is Milos Hrma (played
by Vaclav Neckar), young trainee who has just began to
follow family tradition and earn his living by working in
government service. He is introduced to the job by Hubicka
(played by Josef Somr), womanising train dispatcher whose
constant success with opposite sex causes the envy of an old
and obese station manager Max (played by Vladimir Valenta).
But Max is not the only one sexually frustrated; in such
atmosphere of debauchery Milos is painfully reminded of his
own problems in relationship with conductress Masa (played
by Jitka Bendova), caused by his sexual inexperience. In the
meantime, war is still going on, and Hubicka, who is
involved in resistance movement, has a big ammunition train
to stop.</P>
<P>Those unfamiliar with East European films would have some
difficulties with the beginning of CLOSELY OBSERVED TRAINS.
The interesting prologue (very funny and almost prophetic,
when we consider that this film was made two years before
Warsaw Pact invasion) is followed by scenes in which black
and white photography looks unappealing and the tempo is
slow, with director Menzel often focusing on some often
pointless naturalistic details. However, viewer who is
patient enough to adapt to the film's unusual and often
minimalistic style would be rewarded with an excellent
comedy. The characters are perfectly drawn and the actors
are doing the great job in bringing them to life with small
gestures. Vaclav Neckar is great as protagonist, but even
the actors in supporting roles are great, like director
Jirzi Menzel in hilarious cameo of a young doctor. Vlastimil
Brodsky, one of the best Czech character actors, is simply
brilliant in the role of collaborationist bureaucrat (and
his character could be read as the metaphor for aparatchicks
of Communist Czechoslovakia). Humour, which is often very
dark, brilliantly corresponds with the realism of the film;
characters talk and behave like people we would expect to
see in such circumstances. Humour and hedonism is their way
of combating the sinister reality of war, foreign occupation
and poverty it brings to people.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the dark overtones of this comedy are
broadened in the last part and CLOSELY OBSERVED TRAINS
slowly turns into drama. Hubicka's transformation from
hedonistic womaniser into dedicated resistance fighter isn't
quite explained. The subplot dealing with German ammunition
train still provides good opportunity for a laugh or two. On
the other hand, we have an unnecessary symbolism - Milos
sexual maturity as metaphor for his political self-awareness
looks too much like similar cliches in many WW2 films made
in former Yugoslavia. Menzel ends film rather abruptly,
without proper epilogue and with the unusual, but rather
realistic combination of tragedy and comedy. Even with the
flaws that deprived CLOSELY OBSERVED TRAINS of being the
true masterpiece, this is still a great film that truly
deserved its Academy Award. Those who would like to enter
the magic world of Czech cinema should use it as starting
point.</P>
