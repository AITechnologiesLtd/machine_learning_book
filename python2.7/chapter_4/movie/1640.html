                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>145 min., R, Horror, 1992
Director: Bernard Rose
Cast: Virginia Madsen, Tony Todd, Xander Berkely, Kasi Lemmons,
      Vanessa Williams, Gilbert Lewis</P>
<P>     Virginia Madsen and Vanessa Williams are doing a thesis on folk
lore.  They find one tale about Candyman.  Candyman was a black man back
in the 1600s (?) who had an influential father.   He went to the best
schools, and became a painter.  He was called on to paint a portrait of
one man's virginal daughter, and the painter and the daughter fall in
love.  When the father finds out that the girl is pregnant, he has
Candyman killed by a group of men.  First they cut off one of his hands
with a rusty saw then smear him with honey and let bees sting him to
death.  The folklore says that when you say Candyman five times (into a
bathroom mirror?) he will come and kill you with the hook that has
been nailed to where his stump is.  Madsen and Williams find out that
several killings have been going on in the projects, and Candyman is
blamed.  The two decide to investigate, and Madsen finds out that
Candyman, Tony Todd, might really exist.</P>
<P>     CANDYMAN is based on a short story (I don't remember the title) by
Clive Barker.  Clive Barker didn't write the screenplay for the movie.
CANDYMAN is one of the best horror films to be released to the theaters
this year (but I expect that DRACULA will beat it).  I highly recommend
that you see this film, and don't wait for the video to be released.  On
a scale of zero to five, I give CANDYMAN a five.  CANDYMAN is rated R
for brief female nudity, graphic violence, adult situations, and
explicit language.</P>
<P>     The special effects for this film are great.  The gore is very well
done, without being overly disgusting.  The story is well written and
kept my attention throughout the film.  The script is written such that
the actors don't end up with moronic lines.  The sets are well done and
add a spooky atmosphere to the film.</P>
<P>     The actors (and actresses) all do a great job.  Virginia Madsen
(THE HOT SPOT, CREATOR) is excellent in the main role, as the girl who
may be either losing her mind, or seeing a real demon.  Tony Todd
(NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, 1990 version) is great as the antagonist of
the film.  He makes a perfect demon, who is taking over Madsen's life.
Vanessa Williams gives a good performance as  Madsen's best friend.</P>
