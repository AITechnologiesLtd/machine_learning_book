<PRE>                              KUFFS
                  A film review by Ken Johnson
                   Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>100 min., PG-13, Action/Comedy, 1992
Director: Bruce A. Evans
Cast: Christian Slater, Tony Goldwyn, Milla Jovovich, Bruce Boxleitner, Troy
      Evans, Leon Rippy, Scott Williamson</P>
<P>     Bum Slater finds out that his girlfriend Jovovich is two months
pregnant.  Unable to handle the thought of getting married and having a
baby, Slater skips out on Jovovich.  He goes to see his brother, who is
a rent-a-cop in San Francisco and owns his own district.  Slater's
brother gets killed by a hitman.  Slater inherits his brother's district
and sets out to find the hitman and make him pay for what he has done.</P>
<P>     KUFFS is a wonderful film for those people who like action films
but yet don't want them to be too serious, and for people who like to go
out for a good laugh.  On a zero to five scale, I give KUFFS a four.
KUFFS is rated PG-13 for explicit language, violence, adult situations,
and adult humor.</P>
<P>     KUFFS is not Christian Slater's best film.  In my opinion PUMP UP
THE VOLUME has been Slater's best film (which received a five on my
scale).   Slater's worst film has been TWISTED (which I gave a three).
KUFFS comes in between these two films.  In his career, Christian Slater
has played a variety of people; a skateboarding punk (in GLEAMING THE
CUBE), a brilliant psychotic kid (in TWISTED), a teenager in need of
help (HEATHERS), an outlaw (in YOUNG GUNS 2 and ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF
THIEVES), a rebel (in PUMP UP THE VOLUME), and now a cop (well, it had
to come around sometime, didn't it?)</P>
<P>     Milla Jovovich, the Russian supermodel, has been in one film so
far, RETURN TO THE BLUE LAGOON.  I have not yet seen RETURN TO THE BLUE
LAGOON so I can't comment on her performance.  She put in a very good
performance in this film.  She does, however, take second stage to
Christian Slater, who is obviously the main draw to this film.  All of
the actors in this film did a very good job.  Tony Goldwyn is Slater's
short time partner and is basically around for comic relief so Slater
doesn't have to cover the entire film.  And is that fat cop Robbie
Cultrane?  I missed the name in the credits.</P>
<P>     KUFFS is a very inventive film.  It has come up with what is
probably the most hilarious use for subtitles in the movie industry.
KUFFS also blows away those bleeps used to cover up foul language on
television.</P>
<P>     KUFFS is not a strict comedy like NAKED GUN 2 1/2.  It does have
its share of the laughs though.  Likewise, KUFFS is not a strict action
film.  On how popular KUFFS is with audiences I really can't tell you.
KUFFS opened on Friday and I saw it on Sunday night.  There was a total
of eight people in the theater, but those eight people seemed to have
enjoyed the film.</P>
<P>     So, for a very inventive film that is well worth going to see,
definitely don't miss this film.  It is worth $6.50, or whatever the
ticket price where you are.</P>
