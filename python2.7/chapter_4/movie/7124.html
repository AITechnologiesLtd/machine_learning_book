<P>This campus-story is situated around Melbourne University with a setting of
confused students and their problems with school, sex, money and drugs. It
is difficult to outline a plot but it all fit together, nice and easy. It
is a fresh movie with an unknown but very talented cast. The atmosphere is
sort of a mix between 'Trainspotting' (especially in the beginning) and
'Reality Bites'.</P>
<P>Michael (Matthew Day), a shy medical student, has difficulty getting along
with his room-mates, they seem to party and smoking dope round the clock.
Finally one morning he has had it with them, while Michael is brushing his
teeth a guy rushes into the bathroom and vomit in the wash basin. Michael
goes househunting for a room but no one seems interested to share their
flat with a med. student. At the same time Alice (Alice Garner) and Mia
(Frances O'Conner) is looking for a new room mate to their three-room
apartment. Mia doesn't want her girlfriend Danni (Radha Mitchell) to have
the vacant room, she has other plans with her professor Leach (Kym 
Gyngell). Michael learn about the vacant room from Ari (Matthew Dyktynski),
a fellow student, part-time gigolo and a friend of Mia. During his inter-
view for the apartment, Danni find she is not moving in with Mia and find
another lover.</P>
<P>Alice has problems of her own. Her thesis on Doris Day as a feminist
Warrior is long time overdue and she is always on the run from her guidance
counsellor who want to see some results. She is also looking for a 
boyfriend but her standards is a bit high, she has not had any luck in 
three years. Ari seems to fit her demands but he can't quite comply to the
honesty part, his part-time gigolo job is in the way and he is not that
interested in Alice.</P>
<P>Mia decides to change department at the University, it is too painful to
have professor Leach as a counsellor. He is oppose to the plan and Alice
must fight the bureaucracy which is complicated by the sudden death of the
doughnut-addicted Leach. By the help of Alice and Ari they break in to the
late professor Leachs office and stamp the transfer form.</P>
<P>At the end Alice and Mia is throwing a big party. All the girls are 
attracted to Ari, Michael on the other hand feels like the odd man out and
find refuge at the bathroom. At the end Alice meet Michael and she realise
that he is the one. Mia confide to Danni that their breakup was a mistake
and ask her to move in.</P>
<P>I found Love And Other Catastrophes both refreshing and fun. The cast are
brilliant and director Emma-Kate Croghan manages to control all the 
sub-stories with a steady hand in this day-in-the-university-life story.
The cast are unknown here in europe except for Matthew Day (Muriel's Wedding).
My favourite is Mia as the self-centred lesbian with a crush on her mentor
and is always getting into hopeless situations. </P>
<P>The movie is apparently made for only $50,000 and shot in two weeks, a
masterpiece in my mind. It is a pity that it has not received a wider
audience. In Denmark it has only been shown at the NatFilFestival a total
of 6 times and is not planned for further distribution.</P>
