A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by:
Jon Avnet</PRE>
<PRE>Written by:
Robert King</PRE>
<P>Starring: Richard Gere, Bai Ling, Byron Mann, Jessey Meng</P>
<P>Ingredients: 
Beijing court, innocent Caucasian man, loyal female attorney</P>
<P>Synopsis:
Caucasian Jack Moore (Richard Gere) is at the People's Republic of China
to close a business deal with a high ranking Chinese partner involving
allowing American TV into the PRC; Jack is just about to close the deal.
That night he meets hot babe Hong Ling (Jessey Meng) and they go back to
his hotel room to get lucky. He is suddenly awakened by the police the
next morning, apparently framed for the murder of the beautiful woman. </P>
<P>With the exception of one escape attempt, the rest of the movie is
mostly spent in the courtroom, listening to translated Chinese, where
clues and surprise witnesses come up. Moore is aided by a female
attorney (Bai Ling) who initially doesn't believe Moore but becomes his
loyal ally. Sometimes Moore reads off quotes from a Chinese law book.
Will their teamwork be enough to enable Moore to escape the messed up
criminal justice system?</P>
<P>Opinion: 
Red Corner doesn't contain much in the way of plot or suspense: a jailed
man waits a long time as a lot of evidence is presented.  This movie is
basically a character sketch of the corrupt justice system Moore must
suffer - - he gets about the same kind of justice you might expect from
a corrupt banana republic. But the ending is happy.</P>
<P>Says Director Jon Avnet, quoted on MGM/UA's ‘Red Corner' Web Site:
"When I was in Beijing for a research trip and tried to take a still
photograph of the Beijing Intermediate Courthouse, I was accosted by two
soldiers with automatic weapons and persuaded not to continue my
photography."</P>
<P>"We shot Bai Ling riding a bicycle in Tiananmen Square at considerable
risk to her."</P>
<P>"There were people we met in Beijing who cared enough that we tell this
story accurately, that they were willing to risk retribution to give us
this information."</P>
<P>Historical Background of China and the Movies:
Coincidentally or not, ‘Red Corner' opens as the real life presidential
summit between Chinese President Jiang and American President Bill
Clinton takes place in America. China is predicted by many to become the
world's largest economy next century, and this week's presidential
summit represents a warming of Sino-US ties.</P>
<P>The People's Republic of China contains approximately one fifth of all
the humans in the world. It became communist in 1949, after a civil war.
Meanwhile the defeated non-communist Chinese left the mainland and
exiled themselves to Taiwan to form their own government. Communist
China is now called the PRC (People's republic of China) while the
island of Taiwan prefers to call itself ROC (The Republic of China on
Taiwan) because it is controlled by its own separate government. The
Eisenhower administration in 1954 signed the U.S.-ROC Mutual Defense
Treaty which commits the US to protect Taiwan, ROC from communist
aggression.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, at China's western border China's military invasion of Tibet
occurred in 1950 resulting in the 1951 annexation of Tibet to China. A
Tibetan uprising in 1959 resulted in the Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama
fleeing to exile to India.</P>
<P>The relationship between the US and China began to thaw when President
Richard Nixon visited China in 1972. US and China signed the Shanghai
Communique, in which the U.S. drops political support for Taiwan and
"acknowledges that … there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of
China."  In 1978 Chinese leader Deng paved the way for capitalism to
exist in communist China; he placed profit incentives and economic
progress above traditional Maoist goals, visiting America in 1979. Soon
business put China back on the map; Mr. Deng's policies resulted in
today's high economic growth rate.</P>
<P>China's relationship with the States soured after the July 4, 1989
Tiananmen Square incident. Then in 1995 President Clinton's decision to
grant a visa to Taiwan President Lee enraged leaders of the PRC. This
was followed by the 1996 Taiwan Missile Crisis, where China held war
exercises and lobbed missiles around the waters surrounding Taiwan about
the same time as Taiwan's first democratic presidential elections - -
and the US responded by sending two aircraft carriers to the region.
This occurred against the backdrop of increasing trade relations between
the US and China. </P>
<P>This week's presidential summit between Jiang and Clinton represents an
upswing in Sino-US ties and further travel up the long road to better
communication. </P>
<P>A Warming Trend:
In terms of 1997 film, look for an increasing trend of China related
film this year and next year. ‘Red Corner' actress Bai Ling, is a star
in her native China, and ‘Red Corner' is her first starring role in an
American motion picture. Taiwanese director Ang Lee (‘The Ice Storm')
and Hong Kong director John Woo  (‘Face/Off') are notable examples of
Chinese directors active in mainstream Hollywood cinema, but their
movies this year do not deal with China themes. However, movies by other
directors do: for example, two movies on Tibet (‘Seven Years in Tibet,'
and ‘Kundun') and one James Bond movie with a Chinese female partner
(‘Tomorrow Never Dies,' North American release date December 19) are
scheduled for North American release before this year ends. Acclaimed
Hong Kong fan favorite actor Chow Yun-Fat star in what I believe to be
his first major Hollywood film alongside Mira Sorvino in next year's
(February 1998 release date) Hollywood action thriller, ‘The Replacement
Killers.'</P>
