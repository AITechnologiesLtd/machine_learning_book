            - Van Damme</PRE>
<P>     There's a playful absurdity to SUDDEN DEATH that wouldn't be 
out of place in a John Woo movie.  Sure, the plot--about a lone 
fireman (Jean-Claude Van Damme) in a terrorist-held hockey rink--
is a rip-off of DIE HARD, but the over-the-top approach could have 
come straight from Hong Kong.  Of course, director Peter Hyams 
(TIMECOP) is no John Woo.  (Or, for that matter, even a Robert 
Rodriguez.) He can't construct a tightly choreographed fist-fight 
to save his life.  What Hyams *is* good at, though, is the *big* 
stuff:  impressive aerial shots of the Pittsburgh Civic Arena, 
surrounded on all sides by the flashing lights of emergency 
vehicles.  Or the in-your-face hockey footage that is juxtaposed 
through- out the film.  (The plot has the Vice President held 
hostage during a Stanley Cup playoff.)</P>
<P>     Hyams liabilities as a lean-and-mean action director are 
evident in the very first scene.  Cut to a residential 
neighborhood, where Van Damme's character, a Pittsburg firefighter, 
is trapped inside a working house fire.  The short sequence is 
staged with no more finesse than your average TV movie and that's a 
sign for us.  We know, in those first few minutes, that the rest of 
the action is going to be only OK.  Not great, just OK.  (The later 
"oohs" and "aahs" you hear are from those who have never seen the 
good stuff, such as John Woo's HARD TARGET, made with Van Damme in 
1993.)</P>
<P>     With the visceral impact diluted, the incentive to keep 
watching comes from the honest humor--which is unusually generous 
for a film of this sort--and the parody.  Or is it self-parody?  
Who can tell where to draw the line after watching a free-for-all 
kitchen brawl between Van Damme and a woman in a mascot suit?  When 
a giant penguin tries to push our hero's head into a deep-fat 
fryer, we know not to take things too seriously.  SUDDEN DEATH is 
not a dumb movie, per se, but it is dumb fun.  So, relax and roll 
with the punches.  After all, this *is* a hockey game.  (Rated 
"R"/~110 min.)</P>
