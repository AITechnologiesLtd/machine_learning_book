<P>Arguably, one of the best directors of the motion picture industry,
Orson Welles was once quoted as saying, "When I die, they'll be picking
over my creative bones. The films will suddenly get financing; the films
will get restored. Old scripts that we couldn't get financed, they'll
find the financing for some kid to direct."</P>
<P>Strangely enough, Welles couldn't have been more prophetic.</P>
<P>Actor Tim Robins has donned the writer/director hat for his mostly-true
depiction of the wild chain of events surrounding one of Welles' more
notable career setbacks.</P>
<P>In 1937, Welles, along with his co-producer John Houseman directed a
musical catering to the mass of unemployed people designed to help them
cope with living though the depression era. The musical, entitled The
Cradle Will Rock was a strong pro-union, stab at big business,
encouraging the common man to stand up for what he believed in.
Unfortunately for Welles, 1937 was not just the tail end of the
depression, it was also an era rich with the paranoia of communist
sympathizers and a growing tension between socialism and fascism. The
musical was quickly accused of being communist propaganda and was closed
by the military on the night it was to open.</P>
<P>Not missing a beat and standing true to the adage that "the show must go
on" the cast of the musical marched to a smaller theater some 20 blocks
away and performed the musical in front of a packed audience without the
use of sets, props or even costumes. Union rules at the time prevented
them from even performing on a stage.</P>
<P>Robin's film makes it clear early on that this film is less of a
portrayal of the actual events surrounding the fateful musical and more
of a satirical  look at the sum of its parts. The characters are more
like caricature and it seems clear that Robbins had a bit of an ax to
grind towards Welles.  Angus MacFadyen (Braveheart, The Rat Pack)
portrays Welles as a money-grubbing, pretentious, drunkard, (alright, so
maybe that wasn't so far from the truth). In one scene at a night club,
the playwright (played by Hank Azaria) goes so far as to question
Welles' loyalty to the art by asking, "How soon before you are doing
soap commercials?" -- an obvious stab at his Ernest and Julio Gallo
commercials from the 80's.</P>
<P>This film seems slow and confusing at the start but warms up nicely as
it goes along, thanks to the talents of a surprisingly large and
impressive cast. There are several really blatant pieces of symbolism
throughout the film, and there are a few odd moments that leave you
thinking that you just missed something. However, Tim Robbins does a
great job of tying all of this neurotic, erratic hypertension together
in the end so that it inevitably tells a story of hope and survival for
such an often taken-for-granted ideal as freedom of speech.</P>
<P>The film is witty, entertaining and different. Unfortunately, due to an
acute case of cinematic intelligence, infected with meager support from
Buena Vista Pictures, this movie will most-likely be overlooked by the
majority of moviegoing audiences while they opt for the bigger,
flashier, and easier-to-understand blockbuster flicks being released for
the Christmas season.</P>
<P>But if you happen to find yourself in front of one of those old, small,
artsy theaters, I would recommend stopping in and checking this film
out.</P>
<PRE>3.5 stars</PRE>
