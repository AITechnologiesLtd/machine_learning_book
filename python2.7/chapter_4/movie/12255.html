<PRE>CHINESE BOX
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     "There are moments [when you] see your life very clearly - things
left undone," John laments to himself over his long unconsummated love
affair with Vivian.  They've always known they wanted each other, but
they've let circumstances and spouses get in the way.  (In Vivian's
case it is not exactly a husband but rather a rich live-in lover named
Chang that she hopes to marry.)</P>
<P>     From the wonderful director of THE JOY LUCK CLUB and the more
recent SMOKE, Wayne Wang's new film, CHINESE BOX, is part romance and
part homage to Hong Kong.  His intentions are good, but the delicate
story, which he co-wrote, is never allowed to blossom.  And the
insubstantial script feels like it has "first draft" written all over
it.</P>
<P>     The story is set during the Hong Kong hand over from Great Britain
to mainland China.  Full of the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong, the
handsome cinematography by Vilko Filac suffers from excessive
pixilization during the long video tape sequences that cut into an
otherwise luscious picture.</P>
<P>     "Money, money, money - that's all you hear," John complains, which
is ironic considering he is the author of the old book, "How to Make
Money in Asia."  (He is shown scratching out the word "make" and
putting in "lose" in its place.)  A journalist now, John is played by
Jeremy Irons, who won the Oscar for best actor for his role in REVERSAL
OF FORTUNE.  John's got a rare form of leukemia and is expected to die
about the same time as the hand over - one of the movie's many
metaphors.</P>
<P>     Gong Li, who was so radiantly beautiful in SHANGHAI TRIAD and so
moving in one of my favorite films, TO LIVE, plays Vivian.  Vivian, who
escaped from the mainland, sees Chang as her future.  But since she is
an ex-prostitute ("hostess" to be more precise), he will live with her
but never marry her.  He "generously" arranges for them to be
photographed in wedding clothes, but that is his limit.</P>
<P>     The story's best scene has Vivian and John dancing close together
at a New Year's party.  Their tension is palpable as both are
uncomfortable about their unrequited love.  Vivian's eyes dart about
the room, unable to look directly at John.</P>
<P>     Maggie Cheung plays a con artist with a tragic background that
John becomes obsessed with interviewing.  Although Cheung's acting is
intriguing, her character serves only to confuse an already unfocused
narrative.</P>
<P>     Two people enter the picture only to immediately commit suicide in
order to remind us of the potential tragedy of the hand over.  But the
historical portion of the movie is given even shorter shrift than the
love story.</P>
<P>     Like John and Vivian's love affair, the movie generally leaves you
feeling unsatisfied.  I would have liked to know them better.  The
theme of two people who love each other deeply and who want to have an
affair but can't has promise, especially with such strong leads.</P>
<P>     CHINESE BOX runs 1:49.  It is rated R for language, brief nudity
and some sexual content and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
