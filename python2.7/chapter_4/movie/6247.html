<P>BEVERLY HILLS 90210 MEETS THE NECRONOMICON</P>
<P>The place is ivy-hung and haunted St. Benedict's High (well, I
guess it looks like any other American high school, but then evil's always
on the inside, isn't it?).  It is where Nancy, Rochelle and Bonnie hold
coven against a brutal society of whitebread prom queens and macho jerks.
They're wannabe witches, with their candles, incense and incantations, all
perky breasts and black eyeliner.  They're also ostracized and made fun of
by their snooty SoCal classmates... you know how cruel kids can be about
your hairstyle/skin colour/family background.  But all that changes when
new girl on the block Sarah (Robin Tunney), a "natural witch", is drawn to
them and they discover that together they can call upon a primeval,
supernatural entity to fulfill their wishes.  Uh oh... you know what's
going to happen to those snooty classmates now, don't you?  From scenes of
the ensuing hairloss and humiliation of their clean-cut, pearly-toothed
tormentors, cut to one of our hexy, sexy heroines strutting smugly through
school, suitably hip rock music playing in the background.</P>
<P>Soon enough though, when Nancy (Fairuza Balk) decides that they
should "invoke the spirit", all this happily dysfunctional adolescent
bitchcraft gives way to maledictions of grimer, more potentially earth-
threatening proportions... suffice it to say that whales get killed in the
process.  Not funny at all.  From this point on, to the predictable
show-down between good and evil (a contrite Sarah against an increasingly
twisted Nancy), the only things to watch out for are Fairuza Balk and a
few nifty special effects.  Fairuza Balk (also in THE ISLAND OF DR.
MOREAU) plays the proud but confused Nancy who needs to prove herself to
the world by demanding all the power in it.  She is by turns pathetically
attention-seeking and cruelly malicious, and remains the only believable
character even when she becomes irredeemably diabolical and psychotic.
The penultimate scene where she stalks Sarah through her house is the only
one that is truly eerie, and not because of the inclusion of buckets of
snakes and bugs.</P>
<P>If THE CRAFT was meant to be a scary movie, then it's so only because it 
could have been a cross between THE LOST BOYS and HEATHERS but turns 
out not even close to either of them. It's informed by occult 
references (the movie has a Wiccan priestess as a consultant for
crying out loud), yet fails to be subtle or original about them.  It has
the trappings of a stylish teen satire, yet ends on a humourlessly banal
note.  And it's altogether just too damn serious by half.  What it does
have is a first-rate performance by Fairuza Balk, a great soundtrack, and
enough visually impressive scenes to make a cool music video.  Good enough
for you, I suppose, if you're a trendy, Magic-playing person who always
wanted to be a witch.  But me and the tea leaves are against this one. </P>
<P>Gerald Tan used to belong to the Magical Order of Dagon, but quit when
they couldn't get him a car.  He now belongs to the Cynical Order of
Dependent Twentysomethings. </P>
<P>The Flying Inkpot Rating System:
 * Wait for the TV2 broadcast.
 ** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha! 
 *** Pretty good, bring a friend.
 **** Amazing, potent stuff.
 ***** Perfection. See it twice.</P>
