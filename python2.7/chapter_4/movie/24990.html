<PRE>MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2000 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        If there's anything to be learned from "Mission: Impossible 2" it's
that, contrary to popular belief, machine guns really aren't all that
dangerous.</P>
<P>        I can't for the life of me remember how many times magazinefuls of
bullets are unloaded at our spry hero Ethan Hunt, yet he simply ducks,
dodges, grins, and returns fire as if there were no tomorrow.</P>
<P>        Unfortunately there IS a tomorrow, and it's arrived in the form of
a very unnecessary follow-up to a very poor big-screen version of a great
'60's television series, aka "Brian De Palma mucked up the first one; now
let's watch John Woo muck up the second."</P>
<P>        Woo, the man responsible for such masterful Hong Kong actioners as
"A Better Tomorrow," "The Killer," and "Hard-Boiled," has style--that
cannot be denied.  But substance?  "Mission: Impossible 2" contains some of
the most inane dialogue ever uttered on the silver screen.  How about "I'm
not going to lose you" sobbed to a cute one-night stand?  And remember the
fantastic cleverness of the original TV series so blatantly absent from the
first "MI" movie?  Well it's even more absent here.  Second time around,
the only plot twist is the ol' rubber mask removal trick which happens at
least five times until, frankly, it's lost ALL of its appeal.</P>
<P>        Of course, Tom Cruise is super dreamy even though his incessant
grinning grates on the nerves of not only the arch villain (played by
Dougray Scott, the handsome prince to Drew Barrymore's Cinders in "Ever
After").  In fact, Tom grins throughout the ENTIRE first act until his
boss, played by the gracefully-aging and uncredited Anthony Hopkins, makes
some crack about this not being Mission: Difficult.  Harrumph!</P>
<P>        But come on.  This film has NOTHING whatsoever to do with "MI"-the
television series.  Bruce Geller's creation boasted intricate,
sophisticated plots that wowed you with their gadgets and complex
ingenuity.  Once the facts were on the table, the mission--should Jim
Phelps (now Ethan Hunt) and his allies choose to accept it (they invariably
did)--truly did seem impossible to pull off.  The mission in "M:i-2" is to
hire three people, make sure one of them is Thandie Newton, and recover a
stolen virus named Chimera.  Now how impossible is that?</P>
<P>        Newton, of course, provides the sexy love interest and she performs
this task admirably.  The other two agents are Ving Rhames, who knows how
to use a computer, and some Australian guy who knows how to fly a
helicopter.  So far this sounds like Mission: Piece o' Cake.  Scott, as the
villain, is refreshingly wholesome--and perfectly decent--but even he gets
stuck in too many obvious situations.  How many films have you seen in
which the bad guy threatens to neaten the tip of someone's pinkie as if it
were a slim Cuban panatela?</P>
<P>        If the only problem with "M:i-2" were its sparkling lack of
originality, then audiences might still find some enjoyment in the
interminable action sequences.  But even these are lacking Woo's trademark
sophistication.  There's gunfire a-plenty, but it all seems rather noisy
and unchoreographed.  Tom and Dougray engage in a motorcycle showdown in
which they race at each other at 100mph, leap from their mounts, collide in
mid-air, wrestle each other to the ground, and STILL find the energy to
kick each other in the head for fifteen minutes.  This was easily the
film's funniest scene, according to my pre-teen daughters.</P>
<P>        Likewise, the scariest scene is when Thandie injects the virus into
her own arm--"I just wasn't thinking!"--and the dumbest scene is when
Dougray shoots his own henchman without first checking to see if he was
wearing a Tom Cruise mask.  And to think Robert Towne ("Chinatown") wrote
this screenplay.</P>
<P>        It's never boring, but "Mission: Impossible 2" might well be the
silliest movie you'll see this summer.</P>
