<P>Lenny Bruce: Swear to tell the Truth (1998, NR)</P>
<P>Written, Directed, and Produced by Robert B. Weide</P>
<PRE>Subject: Lenny Bruce</PRE>
<PRE>Narrator: Robert DeNiro</PRE>
<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P> Having proved his ability to handle writing and producing narrative film
with Mother Night, Robert Weide and the crew of WhyADuck productions take on
a much more difficult medium with Lenny Bruce: Swear to tell the Truth.  The
documentary, highly easy to do badly, can be just as emotional touching,
just as engaging as the narrative film.  The majority of them, obviously,
are not.  A very select few are able to touch you like the narrative film
can, are able to pull you in and make you experience them.</P>
<P> I have seen probably fifty documentaries in my time.  I have reviewed four
of them.  Only two of the documentaries I have ever seen have been able to
engage me like Lenny Bruce: Swear to tell the Truth did.</P>
<P> Lenny Bruce: Swear to tell the Truth tells of social satirist and comedian
Lenny Bruce, who, in the process of exercising his own personal demons,
offended just about everyone and made a good half of us laugh during the
1960s.  All right, I wasn't even alive in the 1960s, but he still was
capable of making me laugh even after his death.</P>
<P> We've probably heard his name mentioned.  We may even know a few of his
bits.</P>
<P> Lenny's humor, as the documentary illustrates, was often marked towards the
Catholic church. It took on issues that America simply did not want to talk
about and stuck them right out in the open.  He became a marked man,
offending the wrong people and getting arrested in nearly every city in
America for obscenity or drug charges.  However, he stuck to his guns about
opposing the hypocrisy in everyday life, something which we now admire in
comedians such as John Leguizamo (from Freak: "Dad, why don't you just quit
drinking? Because I'm not a quitter") and Chris Rock (from Bigger and
Blacker: "Old black men didn't have to deal with that I can't get a cab
shit.  He was the cab.").  It was a position that cost him his career, his
fortune, and, eventually, his life.</P>
<P> Sparsely narrated by Robert DeNiro and composed mostly of archival footage,
you are given the feeling that you are not as much watching a documentary as
watching a story unfold…the exact goal of good documentaries.</P>
<P> The film is short, bittersweet, and to the point.  It is reminiscent of
Julian Schnabel's first and only film, Basquiat, which paints a similar
portrait of the lives of Andy Warhol and Jean Michael Basquait, both pop
artists who died tragically.  It also reminds me personally of my friend
Ronald G. Shafer's documentary Donald Hall and Jane Kenyon: "Keeping you
Safe Beside Me", about the tragic death of poet Jane Kenyon.</P>
<P> The lesson to be learned from this would be simply that, occasionally, true
life is better than fiction.  The truth is better than what we concoct.
And, if shown properly, it can bring you to the point of tears in a way all
the more powerful because of its truth.</P>
