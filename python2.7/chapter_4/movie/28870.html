<P>   It would be easy to look at the first few frames of "Liam"--the
sepia photography, the Liverpudlian row houses, the depressing
furnishings inside the home of a family of five being supported
precariously by one breadwinner, and think, "Uh, oh, another one
of those biographical sketches of the writer's or director's or
novelist's childhood seen through the eyes of a little tyke.  Does it
seem like yesterday that we saw 'Angela's Ashes'?"  You
wouldn't be entirely wrong, because "Liam" does indeed draw on
the scripter, Jimmy McGovern's early life experience.  But I know
of no film that better illustrates how trying economic conditions
can lead to the rise of extremist movements, in this case
fascism--and fascism not where you expect it in, say, France,
whose local people collaborated all too often with the Nazi
occupation, or Poland, where Jews were executed by local
fascist gangs when they returned home after the war was over. 
We're talking England, the European land that took in 10,000
Jewish children while Nazism was rising on the Continent (think
"Into the Arms of Strangers") and who bravely stood up to the
Luftwaffe despite attack after tiring and devastating assault.</P>
<P>   Featuring a stunning performance by Anthony Borrows as the
8-year-old title character through whose eyes the drama takes
place, "Liam" hones in on an occasionally happy family in
Liverpool during the 1930's, part of the city's minority Catholic
population which occasionally enjoy spats with their Protestant
neighbors, each belting out patriotic songs that embrace their
separate identities.  The head of household (forcefully played by
the wonderful Ian Hart) makes a decent living in the local steel
mills, but when bad times force the closing of the plant, Dad is
compelled to line up with his fellows every morning hoping
desperately to get day work.  His wife (Claire Hackett) becomes
increasingly nasty as the family faces near starvation, while Liam
is repeatedly browbeaten in his Catholic school by Father Ryan
(Russell Dixon) and his teacher Mrs Abernathy (Anne Reid)--who
conjure up the fires of hell and warn them that their souls are not
just dirty but filthy.</P>
<P>   Given the hardships faced by the families in the neighborhood,
it becomes almost inevitable that some would fall under the
influence of local extremist groups. At one meeting verbal
pyrotechnics break out between a Leninist speaker who urges
the men to join the Communist party but is opposed by another
who warns that the Reds would destroy the churches.  As the
family fortunes spiral downward, Liam's dad eventually joins the
Blackshirts, or the Union of British Fascists, leading him on a
private war against the local Jews--particularly the wealthy and
kind Mrs Samuels (Jane Gurnett) who employs his daughter,
Teresa (Megan Burns) as a maid, paying her extra to deliver
messages to her lover.</P>
<P>   Considerable time is taken up by director Stephen Frears ("The
Snapper," "My Beautiful Launderette," "Prick Up Your Ears") in
displaying the intimidation of the eight-year-olds in their Catholic
school--not surprising when you realize that the screenwriter,
Jimmy McGovern, shocked many Catholic moviegoers with his
1994 film "Priest."  That film, which featured Linus Roache and
Antonia Bird, is a provocative drama about a man of the cloth
who finds himself caught between sacred vows and his own
personal beliefs, especially his closeted homosexuality, and pulls
out the stops in presentation of what Mr. McGovern saw as
messy Church politics. "Liam"'s Church-bashing will remind
movie buffs  of a more recent picture, Sydney Macartney's "A
Love Divided," highlighting  a Protestant woman married to a
Catholic who defies the local priest and kidnaps her daughter
Eileen rather than allow her to attend a Catholic school.</P>
<P>    Filmed and edited by Andrew Dunn and Kristina Hetheringtom
respectively, "Liam" does not linger too long on any scene, as
Frears keeps the momentum through frequent changes of scene</P>
<P>   People like to blame others for their troubles, and why not?  We
have difficulty accepting responsibility for our own failures and
when hard times are the fault of an abstraction known as
business cycles--as was the case during the Great Depression--
we look to something concrete to condemn.  The government? 
Not a bad target, sometimes.  But it's even easier to ascribe our
problems to a relatively defenseless group.  Minorities and
immigrants might be the target du jour given the right political and
economic conditions and we do know that both Communism and
anti-Semitism rose during the Depression in both England and
the U.S.  Given the presence of skinhead movements today--and
a slew of race riots just the other day in London--we wonder how
much worse the chaos would be if times got really bad.  Having
observed convincing performances all around in "Liam,"
especially by the very young title character, we may consider
ourselves warned.</P>
