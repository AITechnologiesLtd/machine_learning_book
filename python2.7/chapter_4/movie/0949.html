                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1991 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  For those unafraid of subtitled films,
     there is a lot to like in the new film production of CYRANO
     DE BERGERAC.  The play is excellent and this is perhaps the
     best production of the play ever done.  Rating: +3 (-4 to
     +4).</PRE>
<P>     Over the past twelve months or so we have seen releases of film
versions of three classic stage plays: Brannagh's HENRY V, Zeffirilli's
HAMLET, and Jean-Paul Rappeneau's CYRANO DE BERGERAC.  For production
quality and for entertainment value I find it very easy to pick HAMLET for
third place.  Choosing between first and second place is somewhat harder,
but for both production quality and pure entertainment value I give the edge
to CYRANO.  This is likely to remain the best adaptation of the story to
film we will see in our lifetimes and very likely the most entertaining,
even if we include Steve Martin's popular modern reframing ROXANNE.</P>
<P>     CYRANO DE BERGERAC is, of course, an adaptation of Edmond Rostand's
popular play, first presented in 1897.  (Rostand took some poetic liberty,
incidentally, but Cyrano was a genuine historic figure who was soldier,
expert swordsman, poet, playwright, philosopher, and even a science fiction
writer.  His best-known literary work today is A VOYAGE TO THE MOON, which
is why Rostand put so many references to moon travel in the play.  Cyrano
suggested several means of extra-terrestrial propulsion, mostly absurd, but
on one he got lucky.  Cyrano de Bergerac was the man who first suggested
that space travel might be possible using rocket propulsion.)  The story is
of the noble swordsman who would like to woo his beautiful cousin but is
stigmatized by his own prodigious nose.  When it turns out that an
inarticulate but handsome soldier under Cyrano's command also loves her,
Cyrano agrees to help the soldier.  The soldier will provide the good looks
and Cyrano will provide the words.  The story packs into a surprisingly
small space comedy, tragedy, drama, action, and adventure.</P>
<P>     This production cost seventeen million dollars and, taking into account
modern production costs, that was something of a bargain, considering the
number of detailed sets, costumes, and even battle scenes.  Presumably
shooting in Hungary kept prices down.  Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau co-
authored the script with Jean-Claude Carriere, editing down the Rostand and
occasionally adding some of their own lines.  The film is in French with
English subtitles by novelist Anthony Burgess, who had previously translated
the play.  The producers decided that for each foreign language in which the
film would be subtitled, they would get where possible the best-known
translator of the play into that language to do the subtitles for the film.
Gerard Depardieu has a very natural style as Cyrano that Jose Ferrer lacked
in the previously best-known film version.  His nose also looks surprisingly
real, thanks to the contributions of Michele Burke, who receives on-screen
credit for creating the nose.  Special notice should be given to a fine
score by Jean-Claude Petit, who produced many very good themes.  For action
scenes his score sounds not unlike Danny Elfman's score for BATMAN, but
Petit also has some very melodic themes for other emotions.  CYRANO DE
BERGERAC is a top-flight production.  I give it a +3 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
