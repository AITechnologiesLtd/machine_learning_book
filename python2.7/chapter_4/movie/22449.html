<P>Simple truths become the most stark revelations of 'American Beauty'. An
excruciatingly thought-provoking satire of the failings of the American
dream, this is an exquisitely stylish film.</P>
<P>Spacey revels in the lead role of Lester Burnham, an everyman of sterile
middle-class suburbia, dissatisfied with the current malaise of his life,
who experiences an epiphany after catching sight of a nubile young friend of
his daughter's, and sets out to reclaim the exuberance of his youth. Bening
portrays his Stepford-esque wife Carolyn, who cannot see beyond outward
appearances and the values of US consumer society, and whose relationship
with Lester could at best be described as distant. Both Thora Birch and Mena
Suvari put in stellar performances as teenagers treading the thorny paths of
their own adolescence - and yet managing to avoid the cliches that spring to
mind when one reads such a description of their roles.</P>
<P>Neither do the Burnhams' equally troubled neighbours disappoint. The
drug-dealing, voyeuristic eighteen year-old Ricky Fitts is one of the most
touching characters to appear in American cinema for a long time. Though
several audible murmurs in the audience professed Ricky to be merely
'creepy', Wes Bentley shows him to be wildly perceptive, and able to
appreciate the beauty that is all around him - hidden beneath the most
mundane of things. His delivery of "Sometimes there's so much beauty in the
world I feel like I can't take it...and my heart is going to cave in" was
breathtaking. Though Oscar nominations seem a given for Best Picture and
Best Actor for Spacey, I really hope Bentley receives the recognition he
deserves: though he will be most likely overlooked when nominations are
being handed out, his performance more than warrants consideration for Best
Supporting Actor.</P>
<P>This is the feature debut for acclaimed British theatre director Sam Mendes,
and 'Beauty' reflects this background, with a strong emphasis placed on the
visual aspects of the film. Mendes and cinematographer Conrad L. Hall employ
the rose motif to great effect: the titular "American Beauty" rose
symbolises both superficial beauty, and helps to reinforce Lester's often
surreal fantasies of the virginal Angela.</P>
<P>Many will find 'Beauty' hard to stomach. Its apparent advocation of
pot-smoking, nudity of minors, frank dealings with Lester's infatuation with
a young girl and his subsequent rebellion will turn many movie-goers away.
And therein lies the true beauty of this film. Its examination of all these
issues forces us to 'look closer', serving to make us feel both
uncomfortable at the parallels with our own lives, and to realise the beauty
of the naked truths that exist behind false exteriors. That we feel a
curious delight as Lester triumphs, and yet disturbance at such an
irreverent quasi-hero is all part of its appeal. Encompassing outstanding
acting by all the cast, flawless dialogue, and originality that has been
sadly lacking in so many Hollywood productions, this is not to be missed.</P>
