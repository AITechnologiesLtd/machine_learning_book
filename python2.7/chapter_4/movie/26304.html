<P>Watching Crash, the recurring thought that popped into my mind was `Damn, I
wonder how these people afford auto insurance.'  I mean, here we have a
movie about people screwing like rabbits while at the same time crashing
cars left and right.  And, although Crash's really made of a lot tougher
stuff than the two of those, they constitute such a large amount of the plot
and curious draw of this safe haven of sadomasochism that the producers used
the quote `…sex and car crashes' (ironically, from a review that blasts the
film) to advertise their celluloid psychosexual psychosis.  Leave it to me
to be thinking of auto insurance rates, when a sexy actresses like Deborah
Kara Unger is going at it onscreen.</P>
<P>Crash is the story of James Ballard (James Spader, picking his most
interesting (and perverse) role since Sex, Lies, and Videotape)), a man who
is living in a marriage with a primal curse: his wife, Catherine (Deborah
Kara Unger), cannot reach orgasm.  She loves sex – her habits are downright
nymphomaniacle and the marriage is open-ended – but nothing she can do can
make her reach orgasm.  Her husband makes this both his personal quest and
problem… the two wonder constantly about each other's sexual partners, go at
it at least twice a day, and often have sex at the office.  Yet nothing's
quite doing it for Cathy.  She's just not getting her big O.</P>
<P>One day, while driving home from working on a car crash safety commercial,
Ballard has a head-on-collision with Dr. Helen Remmington (Holly Hunter).
Remmington's husband dies, flying through the windshield, and the last thing
Ballard witnesses before he passes out is Remmington ripping open her shirt
and proceeding to begin enjoying herself in the car.</P>
<PRE>It gets kinkier.  Much, much kinkier.</PRE>
<P>Once out of rehab for the accident, Ballard meets Vaughn (Elias Koteas,
acting just as creepy as he did in Exotica): a man obsessed with the sexual
aspect of the car crash.  Vaughn lives in his car and re-enacts famous auto
accidents for a living, starting us off with an absolutely riveting
performance of James Dean's fatal car crash.  Played with a charismatic
schizophrenia reminiscent of Tyler Durden, Vaughn's the type of person
leading a quieter revolution towards `the recreation of man in a mechanical
form'… a world in which the lines between male and female, as well as those
between humanoid and machine, are blurred.  The DOT doesn't like this all
too much, but this openly sexual underground goes far beyond them in staying
hidden.</P>
<P>Most of the rest of the movie is spent developing a love triangle between
Vaughn and Ballard and Catherine… yep: get ready for a little good old
homoeroticism or get out.  One particular scene that will cause the
religious right to freak is when Unger vividly describes the taste of semen
to excite Ballard.</P>
<P>One of the few films that could work for both a trechcoat-wearing
theatergoer and a highbrow intellectual at the same time, Crash manages to
simultaneously ask the questions `What makes for a normal relationship?' and
`Have you gotten off yet?' and not, well, crash in the middle.  Yet when it
reaches the end we have solved nothing, proved nothing.  No character
progress has been made, and Cathy still has her little problem.  If I were
less tired and more patient, I might rewatch Crash to try to figure out what
the hell is going on here, but it's late, and I'm ready to simply say what
just about everyone else says when they're done watching Crash: `Boy, that
was one really fucked up movie.'</P>
