<PRE>* * * (out of four)</PRE>
<P>A lot of times a three-star film will be my favorite. They're usually the
kind of movie I can watch most often too. They're usually not too deep,
allowing for semi-brainless relaxation, and at the same time, not too dumb.
MEN IN BLACK is a four-star three-star film. (Hope you could follow that one)</P>
<P>MEN IN BLACK doesn't wait to get to the fun. Just minutes into the film we
are introduced to Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones), introduced to an alien, and
introduced to the the awesome memory-diminishing tool that all MiB agents
use. After all, you can't have alien witnesses running around with that kind
of knowledge can you?</P>
<P>MEN IN BLACK is, of course, the organization which "moniters all
extra-terrestrial activity on Earth". NYPD officer James Edwards (Will
Smith), is on a routine foot chase when suddenly the no-good punk he's
chasing starts leaping up buildings and blinking more than one pair of eyes.
The alien delivers the simple message that the world is going to end, and
with that, dives off of a roof. Naturally nobody believes his story . . .
nobody that is, except for the top secret organization that not even the
government is aware of. </P>
<P>Edwards then meets Agent Kay, the man who never seems to crack a smile, and
is introduced to the MiB. Edwards winds up joining the team and is stripped
of anything that can point back to him (birth certificate, drivers license,
and even the literal removal of his fingerprints). James Edwards no longer
exists. Meet Agent Jay.</P>
<P>Agent Kay takes the rookie Jay under his wing as they go about "regular"
duties. Eventually a far more treacherous event comes into play. A "bug" has
landed on Earth and is going to wipe out mankind if these two don't (or
can't) stop it. The plot isn't exactly clear, but we know it has to do with a
galaxy as big as a jewel or marble being sought after on Earth, and that is
crucial that the MiB find it before the "bug" does.</P>
<P>Barry Sonnenfeld, who also did the ADDAMS FAMILY films, directs this nicely.
It's fun, it's funny, it's action-packed. A nice summer blockbuster as it
rightfully turned out to be. This is one of those movies that is just "fun"
and can't really be summed up any nicer or clearer. Will Smith and Tommy Lee
Jones both do great jobs and both are a blast to watch. Definitely one of the
best films of the the summer of '97, MEN IN BLACK comes highly recommeded
from me!</P>
