<PRE>ATLANTIS: THE LOST EMPIRE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Disney's ATLANTIS: THE LOST EMPIRE mindlessly follows an animated 
formula so old that it creaks.  A rag-tag group of eccentrics, led by a 
self-described "adventure capitalist," Commander Lyle T. Rourke (James 
Garner), is out to find and plunder the riches of the lost continent of 
Atlantis.  Occupying the high moral ground, Michael J. Fox plays Milo 
Thatch, a museum cartographer and linguist who wants to locate Atlantis 
for all the right scientific reasons.  Once there, Milo finds a babe in 
a bikini, Princess Kidagakash "Kida" (Cree Summer), who is a couple of 
thousand years old, but doesn't look more than 20.</P>
<P>The movie's exterior sequences dazzle with sweeping grandeur, but the 
interior ones are as flat as the story's lifeless, silly dialog.  "Melt 
the butter and bring out the bibs," Commander Rourke barks to his crew.  
"I want this monster served up on a silver platter."  The crew includes 
one guy who likes to blow holes in things, one who likes to drill holes 
and one old codger who has holes in his head.  They all look act like 
tired veterans of a hundred Saturday morning cartoons.  Where is the 
imagination and humor that Disney put into TARZAN?  It had more to offer 
in five minutes than ATLANTIS does in a long hour and a half.  And 
ATLANTIS really pales in comparison to Dreamworks' SHREK.  Long sections 
of ATLANTIS could put those under thirteen to sleep.</P>
<P>Sometimes it is the funniest joke in a disappointing movie that best 
defines the film's limitations.  The old guy in ATLANTIS has a tattoo of 
the United States on his chest.  In order to impress a girl, he brags, 
"Watch me make Rhode Island dance," as he wiggles his tummy.  That's as 
good as ATLANTIS ever gets.  </P>
<P>ATLANTIS: THE LOST EMPIRE runs 1:33.  It is rated PG for action violence 
and would be acceptable for any kid of any age.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 12, gave the film ***, saying that it was "good but 
wasn't that funny."  His friends, Rajiv, Maxim and Sam, all 12, gave the 
picture ****, saying that it was creative and had a good plot.</P>
<P>The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, June 15, 2001.  
In the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the AMC and the Century 
theaters.</P>
