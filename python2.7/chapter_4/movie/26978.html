<PRE>The Tao Of Steve
A film review by Michael Redman
Copyright 2000 by Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Human mating rituals have to be the most fascinating aspect of existence.
There is no other activity man (or woman) kind spends so much energy
planning and agonizing over and no other one that makes us look so
ridiculous. "America's Funniest Home Videos" has nothing on 3:00 am at the
local bars.</P>
<P>Dex (Donal Logue) has it all figured out. He's an overweight slacker who
dresses funny; has never had a good hair day; spends his days smoking
American Spirits, drinking beer and playing frisbee golf and was born to bed
the babes. He's the guy who for no apparent reason is inexplicably
irresistible to the fairer sex.</P>
<P>Our pudgy lothario's secret is a mixture of self-serving eastern philosophy
("Be desireless: if you don't want to get laid, you _will_ get laid") and
the "Tao Of Steve" (McGarrett, Austin and McQueen). Within moments of the
film's beginning, he has had his way with a friend's wife in the library
stacks and convinced a young college woman that the true path to
enlightenment lies in his bed.</P>
<P>But, and as Peewee Herman says, "We all have big buts," it all comes to a
screeching halt when he falls for Syd (Greer Goodman) who is impervious to
his charms.</P>
<P>The turning point in the film comes when they discuss Kierkegaard's opinion
of "Don Giovanni" who slept with hundreds of women because he was afraid
that not one would actually love him. Dex's feigned detachment works with
the hundreds, but he has to search for something deeper for the one.</P>
<P>A witty and occasionally hilarious small film, Jenniphr Goodman's debut
directoral outing is a prize. The Sundance favorite isn't perfect: Dex's
scenes with his roommates and poker buddies border on the tedious. But the
screen time with him and Syd is charming and the mismatched lovers ooze with chemistry.</P>
<PRE>And that's what it's all about.</PRE>
<P>[Michael Redman has written film reviews in town for an exceptionally long
time and has to admit to some suspicions when his editor asked him to write
about a guy in weird clothes with unruly hair and his attitudes towards
women. Email clues to <A HREF="mailto:redman@bluemarble.net.">redman@bluemarble.net.</A>]</P>
