<P>starring Jason Biggs, Mena Suvari, Greg Kinnear
written and directed by Amy Heckerling</P>
<P>*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*
As with most of her films, director Amy Heckerling's latest, Loser, seesaws 
between unpleasant and artificial, and is sometimes both at once. When she 
tackles big issues, such as abortion in Fast Times at Ridgemont High , it's 
impossible to tell whether she's being matter-of-fact or glib about them 
(they carry an almost documentary starkness), but whatever the case, she 
continually refuses to comment politically. Such is the sitcom tendency of 
her work: to jeopardize the innocence of her characters and then hit the 
reset button. This fear of drama soured me on Fast Times..., Look Who's 
Talking, Clueless, and now Loser, in which Ms. Heckerling also 
demonstrates, for the first time, zero affinity for the milieu.</P>
<P>Has anyone, for instance, ever met a girl in the stylistic vein of Mena 
Suvari's Dora? Attired in black thrift, her eye shadow smeared to racoon 
chic and her bangy red hair barely contained by girlish clips, she accepts 
the label of goth, but no self-respecting goth girl ever admitted to 
digging, as Dora does, those geriatric rockers Everclear, nor willingly 
went anywhere with a six-pack-wielding fratboy stranger. The mechanics of 
Loser's tired old introvert-boy-falls-for-extrovert-girl plot drive its 
protagonists into cultural non-specificity, so that they become even less 
than stereotypes. They become walking wardrobes.</P>
<P>Small-town transplant Paul (a strangely static Jason Biggs), our eponymous 
hero, always wears his woolly hunter's cap with flaps covering the ears, 
and beneath it rests a parted moptop that couldn't scream "Shemp" (the lame 
Stooge) wig louder. He has three smug-looking roommates (the 
one-dimensional trio is not supposed to be brothers, but they share similar 
facial features, including and especially mouths), and their fashion sense 
is incomprehensibly glam. Though they're not overtly transvestites, 
Heckerling seems to be equating flamboyance with villainy; how very 
Cruising of her. (The dormies conspire to evict Paul and regularly molest 
women they have drugged. Dora ignorantly downs one of their date rape 
potions. Unfortunately, either Heckerling or the studio is too cowardly to 
admit if she was subsequently violated.)</P>
<P>When Paul rescues Dora from said narcotic scare, he learns that she is 
dating their unctuous European lit professor Edward Alcott (superb Greg 
Kinnear). Although Paul's already in love with Dora by this point, as is 
bound to happen to losers when pretty girls address them by name, he gets 
altruistic and pretends the flowers he bought her are actually from Alcott. 
She's thrilled, but nevertheless spends a few days at Paul's to recuperate; 
the two bond over emergency kitten surgery and a Broadway play ("Cabaret"), 
and just when Paul's got in his head that she's starting to love him back 
in that non-friendly way, she decides to become Alcott's live-in 
girlfriend. Cue precious hommage to The Graduate , shots of Paul drifting 
around Berkeley--er... (Aside: Simon & Garfunkel's "Parsley, Sage, Rosemary 
& Thyme" should never have been allowed in another motion picture.)</P>
<P>Heckerling has a lot in common with Nora "You've Got Mail " Ephron, the 
only other prominent chick directing comedies today, in that neither has 
any use for strong-willed women. Men continue to trod on Dora until the 
bitter end (in the final scene, she gives Paul a big smooch after he blurts 
out his feelings in what amounts to a creepy ultimatum), and Dora 
ultimately shrugs off being drugged against her will--mere hours after Paul 
hints to her that she was poisoned, she's cheerily redecorating his 
apartment. (Heckerling is so laissez-faire about the issue in general that 
she reserves the comeuppance of the would-be rapists for jokey epilogue 
titles.)</P>
<P>Goth veneer aside, there are an awful lot of girls out there who behave as 
erratically as Dora, and enough angry young dude filmmakers to make movies 
about them. Heckerling misses her shot at having Dora transform herself 
into a role model, and while such arcs may not be Heckerling's social 
responsibility, it is a privilege I would have taken advantage of if I were 
in her shoes. (Consider, too, that Dora is the film's sole female 
principal.) Not that Loser is worth contemplating this seriously--God knows 
Heckerling didn't. That is her hallmark. (--- For more first-run, DVD, and
