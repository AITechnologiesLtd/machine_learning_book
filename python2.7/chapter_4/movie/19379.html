<P>Make no mistake: "The Prophecy" is not one of the great horror films of all
time nor is it on my list among the best, but it is as intelligent and
hallucinatory a demon/angel horror flick as we are likely to say for some time.
And it is Christopher Walken who transcends its murky storyline. </P>
<P>The film is set in a small Arizona community where there are no secrets, and
somehow this is an existential resting area for the archangels and demons from
above and beyond. There is the sweet, bearded angel Simon (Eric Stoltz) who
takes the souls of humans with him by sucking their breath (a reminder of the
breath-sucking gremlin in "Cat's Eye") - in this case, he has taken the soul of
the most vile human corpse on earth, a general. The archangel Gabriel
(Christopher Walken) is continuing the Second War of the Angels by trying to
prevent Simon from continuing his soul-sucking methods - he wants the souls for
himself. Somehow, this all relates to a brooding homicide detective (Elias
Koteas) who almost became a priest, an elementary school teacher (Virginia
Madsen), a Native American child who may or may not be possessed, and so on. We
see eyeless angels, morgues, burned corpses, demons chained to rocks, visions
of angels impaled in a vast horizon, war atrocities on grainy film stock, and
it is all done with style to spare and never gratuitous or exploitative. </P>
<P>"The Prophecy" never makes much sense and I never quite understood Gabriel's
intentions - does he want to rule the heavens by taking a few souls or is he
just mad at God? Some of this is supposedly based on Milton's "Paradise Lost,"
but it would have been more productive if Lucifer was the one bent on vengeance
against all, including God. After all, Lucifer was a former angel, "The Bringer
of Light," until he was cast down in Hell after questioning God's blind faith.
The main impetus of the film is that the angels got jealous and felt God did
not love them anymore when He gave humans souls but since angels are not human
anyway, what do they care? </P>
<P>The main attraction is the tall, entertaining wonder known as Christopher
Walken - his trademark tics and maneuvering of body language keeps me
interested and riveted from one film to the next. His piercing eyes and offbeat
humor are enough compensation and justified when playing a miffed angel like
Gabriel - imagine what he could have done as the Tall Man in "Phantasm." </P>
<P>"The Prophecy" is a fitful blend of humor and horror and tends to be
over-the-top - Viggo Mortensen overacts and undermines as Lucifer during the
fiery finale. Still, it is unusual and enlightening to see a horror film
concerned with so much biblical jargon and wars between angels. Milton would
have been proud.</P>
