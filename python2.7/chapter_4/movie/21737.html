<P>With Being John Malkovich getting such rave reviews, it just might be
possible that surrealism is making a comeback. That would be good news
for the creators of Goodbye 20th Century.</P>
<P>Goodbye 20th Century is a Macedonian film -- one of only 6 listed in the
IMDB. At first glance it looks like an American action film wannabe. A
band of armed men in black leather wander a desolate hillside. Before
anyone speaks, you might almost expect another Mad Max movie.</P>
<P>But it soon becomes clear that this is no Hollywood film. The angled
shots and extreme closeups look either like footage from an amateur
camera-nerd, or a surrealist playing with perspective. It becomes clear
that the latter is the actual case when a white-robed figure is shot,
but not killed. The stunned, would-be killers empty their guns into this
humble, dream-like, invincible man. Eventually, the murderous mob
decides to let their victim go with just a warning.</P>
<P>There is a circular plot to the film -- it eventually ends where it
began, but not before a second act is played out. This second act is
even more surreal than the first, taking place in a completely white
room with people dressed for a funeral. Our hero -- the character with
whom we empathize -- is apparently as confused by the random actions of
the funeral-goers as I was. This act finally ends as a Santa Claus
figure goes on a shooting spree in this pure-white world.</P>
<P>There are so many more details I could mention, but I have no idea how
to work them into any sort of review.</P>
<P>As you may have guessed, I was more confused than enthralled by this
movie. I did see some artistic merit in the staging and execution of
some of the dreamier scenes. I could appreciate the circular structure
of the film and the strumming of timeless themes. But I couldn't tell
you what it was "about."</P>
<P>Nor, unfortunately, could I tell you why you should see it.</P>
