<P>        I doubt there's a person alive who hasn't fantasized of
one day winning the lottery and retiring to their personal vision
of paradise, possessing the incredible power that only huge
stacks of cash can provide.  It's been said that winning large
amounts of money can change a person.  Ned Devine (Jimmy
Keogh), a resident of the tiny but beautiful village of Tullymore,
Ireland (population: 52), has just discovered the truth in that
statement: money can not only change you, it can actually kill you.</P>
<P>        It's difficult to construct a review of "Waking Ned Devine,"
the new comedy from writer/director Kirk Jones, without resorting to
phrases like "utterly charming," "quaint" and "crowd-pleasing," three
sentiments which have been used so often in film criticism that their
meanings have become basically non-existent.  And yet, "Waking Ned
Devine" *is* charming, unabashedly so, in the way it draws you into
its spell.  With its colorful (read: quaint) characters, idyllic
scenery and wonderful (read: crowd-pleasing) performances, this film
not only reveals its low-budget roots, it flaunts them proudly.
Budgetwise, Jones delivers a lot of visual punch for pennies, making
excellent use of his movie's biggest star: the village of Tullymore
itself.  This is the sort of film that Hollywood has proven itself
incapable of making: it gives us a portrait of small-town
eccentricity, without once resorting to stereotypes, or (even worse)
the typical one-dimensional characters who populate cinematic towns in
movies like "Hope Floats."</P>
<P>        Jackie O'Shea (Ian Bannen) and Michael O'Sullivan (David
Kelly), two of Tullymore's quirkiest yet amiable inhabitants,
discover that a winning lottery ticket has been sold to someone in
their fair hamlet.  Realizing that one of their neighbors is now an
extraordinarily wealthy person, our two elderly friends practice their
charm on everyone in town, hoping to butter up the new lottery
winner, whoever he or she might be.  Through a series of
uproariously funny events which I will not spoil for you, they
eventually discover the winner: the aforementioned Ned Devine.
Unfortunately, poor Ned dropped dead of a heart attack mere
moments after discovering that he was the lottery winner.  This
leaves our friends with a classic moral dillema: if they report Ned's
death to the officials, the winnings will be recycled back into the
lotto for next week's drawing.  But maybe, just maybe, Michael
could pass himself off as Ned (with Jackie's help) when the lottery
man comes to verify "Ned's" claim-- then they can collect the money
themselves!  No prizes for guessing which option the pair chooses.</P>
<P>        The characters in this film are among the most memorable
to hit the screen in years.  Jackie and Michael are an Irish Abbot
and Costello, generating smiles and laughter with their simple
naiveity and the unexpected hardships their scheme forces them
to endure (witness Michael's hilarious nude motorcycle ride,
which I am convinced will eventually find its way into any complete
list of wonderful cinematic moments).  By far, Jackie and Michael
are the sweetest "villains" I've ever seen, partly because the film
makes it absolutely clear that this type of crazy scheme is so very
alien to them.  James Nesbitt is also wonderful as Pig Finn, the
town's sensitive pig farmer, who loves the beautiful Maggie (Susan
Lynch) with an intensity so "real" and honest that I was actually
touched.  Unfortunately, although she does love the handsome
farmer, Maggie can't abide the permanent odor that years of
working on a pig farm have given him... despite the numerous
"fruity soaps" Pig scrubs himself vigorously with each day.  Many
other equally fascinating people dot the landscape of the village,
and I will leave it up to you to discover them.  Suffice it to say,
they're the kind of people you'd love to invite over for a night of
beer drinking and rousing Irish sing-a-longs.</P>
<P>        In fact, "Waking Ned Devine" is so thoroughly based in its
overwhelming sense of sweetness that when that tone vanishes
(in the final ten minutes of the movie), the film nearly derails
itself.  After having spent ninety minutes with a fun, light-hearted
story and its inhabitants, we are suddenly whirled, for absolutely
no reason, into a sadistic black comedy.  It's a jarring switch,
and more than a little uncomfortable... but it passes quickly, and
we're left to end the film on another note of innocence; somehow,
though, after the "black comedy" scene, the transition back to
innocence seems unconvincing and empty.  It's rather like
spending 90 minutes with an adorable, friendly child... then
witnessing a two-minute temper tantrum right before going home.
The mood is tainted, and you tend to dwell on the few miserable
minutes rather than the good parts.</P>
<P>        Other than this one inappropriate tone change near the end
of the story, "Waking Ned Devine" is a spectacular blend of
comedy and characterization.  Kirk Jones and his cast have created
a special film that far exceeds the intelligence of most of the tripe
coming out of Hollywood these days.  Rest assured that if I won the
lottery tomorrow, neither Hawaii or Paris would be my destination;
instead, I'd take you all to Tullymore with me.</P>
