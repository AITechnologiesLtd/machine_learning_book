<PRE>                                  ALADDIN
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1992 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     ALADDIN is an animated film from the Walt Disney Pictures.  It
features the voice of Robin Williams.  Music by Alan Menken, with lyrics
by Howard Ashman and Tim Rice.  Rated G, suitable for all audiences.</P>
<P>     ALADDIN, which ought to be called GENIE, is more properly a remake
of THE THIEF OF BAGHDAD than a telling of the story of Aladdin.  (I
wonder who here has seen Tim Burton's ALADDIN AND HIS WONDERFUL LAMP,
which he made for "Faerie Tale Theatre," with Valerie Bertinelli, Robert
Carradine, Leonard Nimoy, and James Earl Jones?)  THE THIEF has been
made four previous times, including one of the greatest of all silent
films with Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., and directed by Raoul Walsh; others
are the 1940 special-effects extravaganza with Sabu, music by Miklos
Rozsa, directed by Ludwig Berger, as well two newer and more dismissible
versions (one with Steve Reeves, the other made for television with
Peter Ustinov as the king along with Roddy McDowell, Terence Stamp,
Frank Finley, and Ian Holm).</P>
<P>     The Disney version is totally dominated by two entirely different
forces, Robin Williams and computer animation.  Undoubtedly the great
achievement of ALADDIN is yoking these two disparate elements into one
seamless whole.  The other elements of a big animated Disney musical, in
the manner of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and THE LITTLE MERMAID, at least, are
unfortunately either lacking or sadly diminished in this film.</P>
<P>     For one thing, the music is quite dismissible.  There are no really
memorable songs.  The best number is a high-speed patter
song-cum-production-number sung by Robin Williams's Genie.  Nothing can
compare with the score of MERMAID, where the only problem was the small
number of songs (compared to a live musical).  Nothing can compare with
individual songs from BEAUTY, either, like Mrs. Potts singing the title
song.  Alan Menken's lyricist Howard Ashman died of AIDS while working
on the ALADDIN score, and Menken's new collaborator, Tim Rice (who had
previously collaborated with Andrew Lloyd Weber), no doubt was given a
nearly impossible job to do.  The results are forgettable, and I doubt
the score will get an Oscar nomination, as did those of the previous two
Disney musicals.</P>
<P>     For another, the story line is skewed away from developing an
interesting human character, especially in the form of Beauty, in favor
of Genie's pyrotechnics.  This results in a less resonant, less
universal quality, and reduces the value of the film to the value one
brings to Williams's unique talents.  Neither the Thief nor the Princess
can hold our interest on his or her own.  The villain, the sorcerous
Vizier, his parrot-familiar, and the bemused little king provide
entertainment value, but not much in the way of human elements.</P>
<P>     So what about Robin Williams's Genie?  Nothing much, except his
performance is the core of the film, the only real reason to see it (and
resee it).  It is a marvel of breath-taking free association, of verbal
shape-shifting, and of a distinctly un-Disney sense of humor.
Everything about Genie reminds one more of the Warner Bros.  Looney
Tunes that were constantly tweaking Disneyesque pretensions to high art.
But in addition, Genie and his treatment also put me in mind the
distinctly hallucinatory quality of some of Disney's most interesting
films, such as THE THREE CABALLEROS, parts of FANTASIA, or even ALICE IN
WONDERLAND.  Genie is more alive, more intriguing, than any merely human
character, and Robin Williams finds himself in the character.  The fact
that the animators could visualize the free-form flow of Williams's mind
is a tribute to their skills and to their willingness to take chances in
a very un-Disneyesque way.</P>
<P>     All of us computer geeks will be fascinated to see the computer
animation used here.  I think that it must be more extensive, and better
integrated, here in either of the two previous musicals.  Instead of one
or two set pieces, such as the chandelier and ballroom in BEAUTY, we
have here computer animation in virtually every sequence; we have
swooping rides on the magic carpet, we have the streets and alleys of
Aqaba and the palace itself, we have a rolling cylinder, and a lot more.
I look forward to the day when I won't be able to spot computer
animation, and quite possibly that day has already come in some scenes
and effects, but not in all.  It still has a tendency to draw attention
to itself, to look cold and mechanical, if I may so inexactly
characterize the look.  It allows animators to do things that they would
not attempt otherwise, and for that I am grateful; but still one does
look forward to day when it not so distractingly clever and
self-apparent.</P>
<P>     In general, ALADDIN was not the success BEAUTY was, but it still
has powers and attractions and entertainment values that more than
justify a matinee ticket.  Remember that there will lots of kids in the
audience and be patient.  Once the movie starts you will hardly hear a
peep from them.  And of course, if you are a parent, this is your chance
to get out of the house and not have a qualm.  The kids will like it and
you will like it.</P>
