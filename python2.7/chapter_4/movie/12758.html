<P>   Honore de Balzac's novella "A Passion in the Desert,"
adapted for the screen by Lavinia Currier, gives new
resonance to the term, "Come on in; the water's fine."  Filmed
in Petra, Jordan and in Moab, Utah to represent the Egyptian
desert, the story takes place in 1798 during Napoleon's
bungled Egyptian campaign and focuses on a French captain
who underwent an adventure with which Maupintour could
never compete. What's more he paid nothing for the
escapade and nothing for clothing, though he did have to put
up with some awfully catty comments about his demeanor.</P>
<P>   The film's themes are as eclectic as its production.
Production-wise, though "Passion in the Desert" hones in on a
batallion of the French legions in Egypt, the men (even Michel
Piccoli) speak English, the French captain is British, and while
the Egyptian desert might have been a fine backdrop, director
Currier threw sand in Mubarek's face by filming in Jordan and
Utah.  Thematically the narrative is in part a philosophic
meditation on the enigmas of nature, with a targeted audience
of both fable-loving children and contemplative adults, in part
a study of reason vs. emotion, and in part a contrast between
European and Near Eastern cultures.  There is little dialogue
and even less plot: this is not a criticism.  Currier exploits the
motion picture genre for what it does best, which is to impart
stark imagery to get its points across.  While some of the
more riveting segments cross the screen, you'll be tempted to
phone the makers of National Geographic films and advise
them to see the picture.  Currier does not rely on
Geographic's pretentious anthropologists and didactic
commentary to command our concentration.  </P>
<P>   Written by Balzac at the beginning of the Nineteenth
Century, "Passion in the Desert" follows a ragtag division of
French forces trudging through the barren Egyptians sands
convinced by their Enlightenment views that they cannot get
lost.  After all, there's the Nile over here and the ocean over
there, or so believes Captain Augustin Robert (Ben Daniels),
who is escorting artist Jean-Michel Venture de Paradis
(Michel Piccoli) through hostile territory.  Venture's
assignment is to sketch what he can of Egypt's art while
Augustin must do what he can to stop the philistine French
soldiers from blowing up aspects of Egyptian culture that they
meet along the route.  When a sudden fight erupts between
fierce Marmaluke warriors and the European intruders,
Augustin and Venture lose each other, and when Venture
shoots himself, Augustin is left alone at the mercy of nature
and a Bedouin fighting force.  </P>
<P>   Near death from thirst and hiding in a cave from a band of
Marmalukes, Augustin encounters a feral leopard who,
fortunately for Augustin, prefers Egyptian food to French.  For
reasons known only to feline psychologists, the big cat takes
a liking to the lost soldier, leads him to water, shares his food
with the young man, and allows itself to be petted.</P>
<P>   "Passion in the Desert" turns around the expected
convention of man subjugating beast as Augustin becomes
part of the leopard's world, even stripping what remains of his
uniform and crawling naked on all fours packed with facial
make-up.  What happens ultimately to this relationship is
almost predictable, the film's conclusion posing a trenchant
inquiry into man's role in nature.  One scene, which could
have some uptight parents wishing they had not taken their
six-year-olds to the movie, displays Augustin erotically
caressing the spotted animal whom he has named Simoon. 
Augustin's is the sort of adventure that most of us will never
have.  We have given up the itinerary of the solitary traveler
who places himself at the forbearance of nature at its most
spartan and spacious in return for the comfort and swaddling
security of the five-star hotel with well-organized, terminally
crowded safaris.  </P>
<P>   Ben Daniels has a commanding presence in letting out the
feline in himself and the three trained cats--who had proved
perilously unpredictable working on the set with Daniels--
move with the grace of undomesticated animals who
perpetually savor the joys of the hunt.  The parable is
professionally lensed by the Russian cinematographer, Alexei
Rodionov with an exotic soundtrack of Arabic music by the
Spanish composer Jose Nieto. PG-13.  Running time: 93
minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
