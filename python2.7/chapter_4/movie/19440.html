<PRE>                                EYES WIDE SHUT
                         A movie review by Joe Barlow
                             (c) Copyright 1999</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING:  Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollack
DIRECTOR:  Stanley Kubrick
WRITERS:   Frederic Raphael and Stanley Kubrick
RATED:     R
RELEASED:  1999</PRE>
<P>        I really wanted to love "Eyes Wide Shut," the much-hyped
final film from the the late Stanley Kubrick.  I'd hoped to use
this review as a soapbox from which to praise and mourn one of
cinema's most innovative filmmakers, and I wanted to be able to
tell you that "Eyes" is a remarkable achievement, a visceral
odyssey of sight and sound that would prove, like Kubrick's best
work, impossible to shake.  Such words would make the director's
untimely death (he passed away four days after completing work
on the project) even more tragic, as he appeared to be on a
creative upswing: Kubrick had reportedly been gearing up for
another film, a promising sci-fi thriller entitled "A.I."  But
now, whether he intended it or not, this final movie must
forever bookend the remarkable career which began with 1953's
"Fear and Desire" and progressed through such cinematic milestones
as "2001: A Space Odyssey," "Spartacus," "Lolita," "The Shining,"
"Dr. Strangelove" and "A Clockwork Orange."  Could any film
possibly ascend to such lofty heights?</P>
<P>        Preliminary signs looked good: "Eyes" has generated
positive word of mouth from the handful of people who were
allowed an early peek at the completed film.  Even with the
good buzz, however, relatively few plot details were available
for the asking: a fierce veil of secrecy, reportedly instigated
by Kubrick himself, has blanketed the project almost from the
start.  About the only details I knew going into the screening
were: a) the film reportedly takes a cerebral look at sexual
dysfunction; b) the movie was nearly rated NC-17 because of
its nudity and depiction of sexual acts; and c) the film's
stars (and real-life spouses) Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman have
plenty of opportunity to 'get jiggy' with each other on-screen.
Walking into the theater, I wondered exactly what I was going
to get.</P>
<P>        So how does the movie stack up?  Well, I'll put it this
way: I saw the film on opening day with two of my closest
friends, and our opinions covered the entire spectrum.  While I
had significant problems with the story, I found much of the film
brilliant, overflowing with the Kubrickian touches that have made
his work such indelible artistic achievements.  Friend #1 was
basically indifferent, citing a couple of things he enjoyed and
a couple he didn't, but overall possessing no strong opinion either
way.  Friend #2 called it "unquestionably the worst movie I have
ever seen in my entire life."</P>
<P>        I can understand all three viewpoints.  "Eyes Wide Shut"
is far from perfect and nowhere near Kubrick's best work, but I
think that one's potential appreciation (I hesitate to use the
word "enjoyment") of the film will depend primarily on the
expectations the viewer brings into the theater.  As usual,
Kubrick establishes a laconic pace early-on for the story, which
will unquestionably bore many viewers (never have I heard so
much restless shuffling from an audience).  Surreal images float
dreamlike across the screen.  Long passages of the film are
rendered in absolute silence as the director allows our eyes,
not our ears, to convey the full story.  It is, in short,
business as usual for a Kubrick film.</P>
<P>        The marketing campaign is directly responsible for
the disappointment and confusion many audience members feel
after screening the movie.  "Eyes Wide Shut" is being
advertised as a rauchy sex-fest, but it's nothing of the
sort-- although the film contains a rather extreme amount of
nudity, the concept of sexual dysfunction is explored with a
cool, aloof eye from Kubrick.  Yes, there's a lot of on-camera
sex, but it's neither erotic nor passionnate.  Everyone has
been objectified to the point where all desire is irradicated.
People here seem to make love simply because it is expected
of them, not because they have any wish to perform the
action.  Despite the nudity, you'll be hard-pressed to find
a LESS erotic movie.</P>
<P>        The story, in a nutshell: Bill Harford (an excellent
performance by Tom Cruise) is a happily-married doctor living
with his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) and their daughter in
upper-middle-class bliss.  Bill's life seems perfect until
Alice drops a bombshell on him, admitting that she still thinks
about sex with other men despite the decade-long marriage the
couple have enjoyed.  After Alice confesses that she nearly
cheated on her husband with a naval officer, Bill enters a
48-hour state of mental turmoil, during which he becomes
immersed in a seedy underworld where sex, scandal and
death are bedmates.</P>
<P>        First, the good news: "Eyes Wide Shut" is constructed
with the considerable technical virtuosity that Kubrick has
demonstrated in nearly all his films.  It boasts the loveliest
cinematography I've seen in recent memory (Kubrick was a staff
photographer for LOOK magazine before he embraced filmmaking,
and he knew how to use lighting, angles and color to maximum
effect), making the film fascinating to watch even when the pace
lags.  Tom Cruise turns in an Oscar-caliber performance for
his role as the confused and hurt Dr. Bill.  The film boasts
a rich, chilling gothic atmosphere, which serves the story's
tone well.</P>
<P>        Now, the not so good: "Eyes Wide Shut," even by Kubrick
standards, is excessively long and often uninvolving.  The sparse
musical score (consisting almost entirely of a solo piano playing
two notes) is repetitive to the point of madness.  (I'm sure it
was done for atmosphere, but by the end of the movie the audience
burst into laughter each time it appeared.)  And at times, the
movie seems unsure of what it's supposed to be, and what it's
trying to say.</P>
<P>        Still, even if it doesn't quite work, "Eyes Wide Shut"
will likely be remembered as a great experiment gone slightly
wrong.  I respect Kubrick's attempt to embrace complex themes
and tell an astoundingly orignal story, rather than adopting cheap
cliches and formula, as so many other filmmakers choose to do.
It's not a perfect film, but Kubrick afficianodos, a group I
consider myself part of, will no doubt find much to like, even
if these praiseworthy aspects have more to do with the film's
technical elements rather than the actual storytelling.  It's
not the be-all, end-all Kubrick film that I'd hoped it would be,
but it has much to offer the patient viewer.</P>
<P>        Whether non-fans will like it is another question
entirely.  It's possible, as long as they're expecting a
cerebral odyssey and not a porn movie.</P>
<PRE>                  BASE RATING: **  out of a possible ****</PRE>
<PRE>             (Subtract half a star if you're not a Kubrick fan.
                 Add one star if you're a die-hard fanatic.)</PRE>
