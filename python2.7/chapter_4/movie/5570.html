<PRE>                        THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME
                       A film review by Lewis Butler
                        Copyright 1995 Lewis Butler</PRE>
<PRE>        In Short:  A suprisingly passable Disney movie, quite a bit
        better than THE LION KING although the music is just as poor,
        if not worse.  Not a simple memorable song, again.  Still, a
        darker Disney than we've seen in many years, and some truly
        outstanding animation.  +1 on the -4/+4 (A solid 0 in comparison
        to other Disney animated films).</PRE>
<P>I haqve to vent a little here, so go ahead an skip this paragraph if you
think all cartoons should be rated G, no matter what.  THE HUNCHBACK OF
NOTRE DAME starts with the murder of Quasimoto's mother on the steps of
Notre Dame.  This murder is quite visual (not like the distant shot in
Bambi) and quite obvious.  This movie should have been rated PG, and a
solid PG.  This is not the only time THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME shows
a violent streak, but it is the first, and it would have quite an impact on
any child much under 8.  If this movie had been live-action, with identical
shots, it would have been rated PG-13.  Now, I'm not saying it should have
been rated PG-13, but a PG rating would have been appropriate in this case.</P>
<P>Now, as for the film.  The voice talents are good.  Even Demi Moore, who I
was worried about, performed well.  The story is quite faithful to the
other movie versions, up until the last five minutes.  There is some
wonderfully done computer animation of the crowds and some flocks of birds.
As I said, the music is there, but not memorable in anyway.</P>
<P>There is one interesting shot where Quasimoto is singing from the roof of
Notre Dame, leaning over a gargoyle.  The scene reminded me so much of a
similar shot from AN AMERICAN TAIL that I'm convinced the hunchback was
singing "Somwehre out there."</P>
<P>The brightest spot of the movie, I think, was Jason Alexander as the voice
of one of the Gargoyles.  His gargoyle is something like a cross between
the "Crazy Eddie" in LION KING and his Duckman persona from the USA cable
show.</P>
<P>Obligatory "Disney is racist" comment:  If Quasi is a gypsy and all the
gypsies in the movie are shown with dark skin, why is Q so fair?</P>
<PRE>Minor Spoilers</PRE>
<P>The ending of the movie could have easily destroyed whatever there was to
appreciate in this film, but it manages not to, somehow.  Despite the happy
hollywood ending, it doesn't get too smarmy.  Yes, Quasimoto lives, this is
a Disney movie after all, what did you expect?  Still, the movie makes it
mostly work.</P>
