<P>     Every once in a while, someone gets the bright idea of making an
apocalyptic horror film.  THE OMEN series is probably the best-known
example of this sub-genre, but it's not the only one.  Now, THE
PROPHECY, with its tale of warring angels and lost Bible chapters,
joins the group.  There's a twist here, however.  In the past, Lucifer
has always been the bad guy.  This time around, he's actually on the
"good" side.  Of course, that's only because it suits his purposes, but
still....</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, Viggo Mortensen's Devil doesn't appear until very
late in the proceedings, and by then, THE PROPHECY has long since worn
out its welcome.  The script, with its odd combination of Biblical
ramblings and gory violence, is as silly as they come.  Characters take
all sorts of supernatural occurrences as a matter of due course.  No
one seems bothered by the sudden appearances of angels or the knowledge
that God has basically left humanity to "work out [its] own salvation"
in rather literal terms.  Even the unexpected apparition of Satan does
little more than raise an eyebrow or two.</P>
<P>     Not counting Lucifer, there are basically two angels floating
around:  Simon (Eric Stoltz) and Gabriel (Christopher Walken).  The two
are mortal (or should that be immortal?) enemies; thus, one of them
doesn't make it to the climax.  Before Simon departs his earthly body,
he passes on his secret weapon--the soul of the perfect killer--to a
young girl (Moriah Shining Dawn Snyder).  Gabriel wants this weapon for
his side, and is willing to rip the girl apart to get it.  Standing in
his way are a pair of puny humans--seminary student-turned-cop Thomas
(Atom Egoyan regular Elias Koteas) and the girl's teacher (Virginia
Madsen), aided of course, by the aforementioned Lucifer, who has a
grudge against Gabriel.</P>
<P>     As dumb as THE PROPHECY is--and it's very dumb--at least the film
rarely takes itself seriously.  Writer/director Gregory Widen
apparently realized that the best way to approach the story is to take
the campy road, which is exactly what he has done.  THE PROPHECY is
frequently irreverent and is littered with lines of dialogue which
equate to the director winking at his audience.  Christopher Walken's
wonderfully droll performance is perfect for his role as the "killer of
firstborns."</P>
<P>     Alas, Walken is really the only interesting performer.  Koteas and
Madsen are boring, and most of the unnecessarily protracted story
centers around their characters.  We never feel anything for them, so
all the screen time used attempting to develop their personalities
becomes wasted.  In fact, "waste" is a good way to describe most of THE
PROPHECY.  In the final analysis, this is a bad movie with a good sense
of humor.</P>
