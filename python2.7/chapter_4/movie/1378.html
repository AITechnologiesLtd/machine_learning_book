                               [SPOILERS]
                       A film review by John Locke
                        Copyright 1992 John Locke</PRE>
<P>     I'm baffled by the acclaim shoveled upon BOYZ N THE HOOD.  It
wasn't even film school quality.  It's more like a B+ in Sociology 1.
Each scene makes its blunt, bludgeoning point about life in the ghetto
(we know it's a ghetto because there are artfully placed heaps of
garbage here and there).</P>
<P>     Many of these points are the utterances of the characters.  There
are a number of "characters," but most of them are the same person, the
director, John Singleton, who uses his characters as mouthpieces for his
own ideas.  When young Tre points to the map of Africa and says that's
where the first man came from, it's Singleton talking.  When the
football recruiter makes a speech on the improbability of making the
NFL, it's Singleton talking.  In one of history's worst lines of
dialogue, Tre's father asks Tre how the SAT went, then casually notes,
"of course those tests are culturally biased, except for the math
parts."  Yep, it's Singleton talking.  We don't get to actually hear one
of the "culturally biased" questions.  We're supposed to take
Singleton's word for it, I suppose.  (Didn't Singleton see STAND AND
DELIVER?  "Those people" pass "those tests" when they study for them.
Oops, I forgot--"those tests" were all math parts.)  When that line is
dropped with a dull thud, I realized that the whole minor thread about
taking the test was a set-up for that one lousy line.  The piece de
resistance of pontification occurs under a billboard in a vacant lot.
Tre's father's lecture on gentrification attracts a variety of
neighborhood regulars, from dope dealers to the perpetually unemployed.
But their discussion sounds like a MacNeil/Lehrer roundtable on urban
issues.  Where's the m*th*rf*ck*n' verisimilitude?</P>
<P>     This last is representative of the pervasive illogic of the film.
There's a barbecue, the host says the food is ready, and 50 people stand
up in unison, like so many robots, and crowd the table.  There's no
guile to the direction.  You can picture Singleton instructing the
ensemble: "on 'ready,' rush the table."  At times, the amateurishness is
laughable, like when young Tre is delivered to his father to undergo
"manhood training."  Dad is so glad to see him he immediately puts him
to work raking up a thick deposit of Autumn leaves from the front yard.
But here's the kicker: there are no trees in front of the house!  Where
did all those mysterious leaves come from?  Not only that, the raking
appears to take Tre hours (can't learn manhood in twenty minutes).
Someone glued those damn leaves to the lawn.  Add to that the
sociological illogic: Tre learns manhood by performing the work his
putative post-manhood father neglects.</P>
<P>     The whole film ends up with a staged, faked feel.  I never felt I
was watching real characters acting spontaneously.  We get a football
player who never plays football, or even talks about it; we get drug
dealers who never deal drugs.  BOYZ N THE HOOD is like an updated
version of those right-way-and-wrong-way-to-ask-a-girl-for-a-date films
they occasionally showed us in high school.  Now they show us films
illustrating sexual harassment in the workplace.  Snore...non-actors
making obvious points.  Somehow these films always end up
unintentionally funny, and so does BOYZ N THE HOOD.  In the
heart-assaulting finish, the football player is victim to a drive-by and
his homeboys take his blood-drenched corpse home and dump it on the
sofa.  I know I'm supposed to be sad during this scene but instead I'm
yelling, "so that's why they"--er, "they"--"cover the upholstery with
plastic."</P>
<P>     BOYZ N THE HOOD is well-intentioned, like the behavior training
films, but that doesn't redeem it as film art.  The first obligation of
a director is to tell a story; intellectual statements can only flow
from the story as an indirect effect.  I couldn't mourn the murder of
the football player because he'd never been given human dimensions.  The
power of film as a salve for our prejudices is that it can show the
common human links between people of different cultures.  BOYZ N THE
HOOD fails on this very basic level by not developing its characters and
making them or their world realistic.  The characters rarely breath as
real people because they're too busy demonstrating the director's
sociological agenda.  I didn't see any special insight into the
characters or their situations by the director.  Nothing rang true
because there was no originality to offset the predictableness.
Ironically, this film could just as easily have been made by a white
director or anyone else as unacquainted with the ghetto as John
Singleton.</P>
