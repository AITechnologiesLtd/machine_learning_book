<P>The best the English have to offer, is not always a technical piece, but one
can never, ever, fault the outstanding performances that one gets when one
see an Ivory & Merchant piece of work.  They just have the
innate ability, perhaps it is novelist Ruth Prawler Jhabala's talent, to
come up with some pieces that just tear your heart into watching something,
even if it is the downfall of an anthill.</P>
<P>THE REMAINS OF THE DAY is just such a piece. One realizes that there isn't
much that is going to happen, except the end of the old fashioned standards,
and yet, we see the valiant servant and butler do his very
best, despite the most unfortunate odds, and pressing of situations.</P>
<P>In the process the butler, and the leader of all the servants hires a woman
that has a bit of the independent spirit, but is capable nonetheless.  And
she proceeds to help make the house run a bit more efficiently, so Stephens
can concentrate on his duties.  In the middle of it, we see him show what
makes him so special to any lord that owns the mansion.  He is the mansion.
Be it a politically sensitive situation, or just serving yet another drink
to a guest on a fox hunt, the ever faithful servant who never loses sight of
his job, manages to maintain his position, and those of his master.</P>
<P>But he has a failing.  His job is so important to him, that he never has the
time to check into the chances he has to meet Mrs. Kenton, whom he has come
to like, but his position will not allow him to do anything with.  It just
isn't his priority, it seems.  And in the end, with a new tenant, he takes a
trip, and tries to lure Mrs. Kenton back to the fold, but she is married,
has come to appreciate her situation, and now her daughter is on the way to
have a child, which prevents her from joining the lonely Stephens, and help
once again to make the mansion run as smoothly and efficiently as ever.</P>
<P>Anthony Hopkins, once again, shows why he is such a master actor. His
portrayal of the aging butler, who is very much in control of his faculties,
is a pleasure to watch.  Even when in the midst of very sensitive political
discussions he manages to keep his opinions to himself, and show himself a
truly exceptional servant in every
way.  His lord seems to have some affiliations to the Nazis in a business
sense it seems, and although it is becoming a fast, and harsh fact, he still
manages to pour yet another cup of tea, and not discuss anything of a
political nature.</P>
<P>Later, a brash American business politician retires to the same household.
Earlier, in a meeting of the minds, the senator had made comments that
displaying his unpopularity in this very formal group of upper crustaceans.
But he had an idea of what the future might bring, rather than accept the
norm of the present at the time.  His brashness may have made him unpopular
with the other guests, but it signaled the change of the guard as well.
Stephens has it all, like they all do, but he has no sense of personal
living, or appreciation for life as a normal man would. This is the part
that the subtle Mrs. Kenton provides, although never passes past the point
of asking Stephens why he does not display his feelings.  by the time he
does, he can no longer connect with the woman he might have loved as
faithfully as he does his master.</P>
<P>It's hard not to enjoy this VERY SMOOTH film, and fail to appreciate the
nature of the acting.  It is blended smoothly with very gentle angles, and
never uses the camera as an intrusive detail of the story.  It stands aside
and shows us how live moves, and lives, and in Stephens' case, how it is
served.</P>
<P>Beautifully conceived, with exceptional dialogue, and very well written
exchanges that never reach a boiling point in the most extreme, and
sensitive of situations.  Few films will ever stand up as well as this one
does.  Pure, and true literature of film, if there ever was anything of the
kind.  They should teach things like this to film makers.</P>
