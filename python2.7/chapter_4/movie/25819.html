<P>Looking back, it seems as though I was a little kind to Roland Emmerich's
version of GODZILLA (6/10) a few years back. I apparently really liked the
special effects, despite them being wrapped in a garbage stench of a plot
and characters, and stamped it with a "barely recommendable" nametag. I
don't know, I might've been drunk when I wrote that review :). But if you
look at this film, many of the same issues apply, with the major difference
being that this film is so over-the-top cheesy that it actually provides for
a sizeable amount of entertainment. So if you don't expect HAMLET and campy
flicks are your bag, this one should fill it up real nice.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Big giant green monster named Godzilla comes out of the Tokyo waters at
sundown to pummel down all that is in his path. Scientists and government
officials attempt to stop it. But what's this? An alien flying saucer is
discovered underwater and it seems to want Godzilla for something too. Slap
them all together, and get ready for a big showdown featuring bumbling
scientists, Godzilla and nasty aliens.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Can a movie packed with cheesy acting, cheesy dialogue, cheesy effects and a
cheesy plot actually = a good movie? Yup! In this case, this is just that
kind of movie! Cheese with plenty of mustard, relish and a deep appreciation
for films that are really bad. But don't get me wrong, the film isn't all
that horrible. In fact, many of the special effects in this film are
actually quite good, especially during the film's first 10 minutes. The plot
is also goofy but definitely more original than the lame "let's lay some
eggs" plot from Emmerich's GODZILLA, and the action scenes deliver plenty of
cool sequences. So will you enjoy this movie if you go in thinking that it
will be good? I doubt it. The whole point of a film like this is that you
know that it is "bad", but you end up laughing and enjoying it anyway. Well,
at least I did.</P>
<P>The only reason that I didn't score it higher is because even as a good
"bad" movie, it lacked somewhat. There were way too many scenes of Godzilla
slowly making his way through the city...and I mean reaaaaal slow! Step it
up, slowpoke, you're a fiery beast!! The film also lost me about halfway
through when they decided to leave Godzilla in the background for a while
and concentrate more on this whole side-plot involving a dude getting
trapped in a building which is just about to blow up. You don't really need
that kind of thing here. Slowed the film down somewhat. But it was all good
when the big green rubber-looking monster came growling out of the water and
kickin' that major Tokyo ass. Who wouldn't enjoy two giant rubber dolls
trading swings and fire rays?! I know I did. Overall, this is NOT the kind
of film that "regular" movie-goers will likely enjoy. It's a film for people
who like making fun of the bad dubbing, watching over-the-top actors deliver
bad lines and obvious sets. Overall, I would say that it's a fun ride...but
only if you've chosen to be on that ride. Know what I mean?</P>
<P>PS: The best/worst, and I mean BEST line in this whole movie comes from a
scientist near the end of the film, who gives us his reasoning behind
Godzilla's humanistic qualities. You will ROLL in the aisles!! "it's because
there's a little Godzilla in..."</P>
