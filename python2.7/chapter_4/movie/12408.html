<P>In 1997, it was impossible to mention the movie DANTE'S PEAK without
talking about VOLCANO shortly thereafter. The case might be much the
same for 1998, when movie going audiences will be subjected to the
"twin-vision" releases of DEEP IMPACT and later this year's ARMAGEDDON.
>From the release of the previews, it was obvious that the filmmakers
involved were sending their asteroid-threatens-Earth tales in different
directions. DEEP IMPACT, by far the more character-oriented tale of the
two, loses a lot of the momentum it might've had by struggling through a
muddled storyline; if anything, this cost it any chance it had to outdo
ARMAGEDDON. </P>
<P>Usually, for disaster event movies, the plot begins a reasonable amount
of time prior to the cork-popping (whether that's a volcano exploding or
aliens attacking a la INDEPENDENCE DAY). Here, however, storytellers
Michael Tolkin and Bruce Joel Rubin begin the movie a great deal of time
- almost a year, in terms of the movie's scope - before the event and
lead up to the two most exciting parts in the movie with convoluted
storylines. This lack of plot sense does not inspire confidence, and
soon the viewers are left to do nothing but anticipate the moment of
impact (which, thankfully, does arrive). </P>
<P>DEEP IMPACT is really three stories in one, all of them mostly
independent but all of them connected by the common threat of the
asteroid's imminent collision with Earth. The first is of Leo Biederman
(Elijah Wood), a kid astronomer who first notes the asteroid almost a
year prior to its collision with Earth; the second is of Jenny Lerner
(Tea Leoni), an ambitious reporter for MSNBC who discovers the
government's contingency plans a few weeks before they become public
knowledge; and the third is of Spurgeon Tanner (Robert Duvall), a
seasoned veteran of an astronaut who must lead a team to land on the
asteroid's surface and blow the rock apart with two nuclear bombs. </P>
<P>The movie, for all its intricacy, would've made a better book than a
movie. Because there are three main plots, and several other minor ones
that give relationship, the movie ends up being much less solid then
hoped for. Directed by Mimi Leder, it has the same helter-skelter feel
of her last action thriller, THE PEACEMAKER. Here, however, her pacing
is worse: the plot lends itself to two incredible scenes of exciting
visuals strung together by lulled plot points for an even 120 minutes.
For all its worth as an "event" movie, DEEP IMPACT may be wide of the
mark, and in two months' time, we'll hope for ARMAGEDDON to fill the
void.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "DEEP IMPACT": 2.5 stars - an enjoyable movie.</P>
