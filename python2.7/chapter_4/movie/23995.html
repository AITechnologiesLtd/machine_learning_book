<PRE>Amen to your Oi
Keeping the Faith</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>We all love Ben Stiller of "Something About Mary." And Ed Norton has
certainly become a well respected actor of recent time. (He's directing this
picture, by the way.) And who could resist the sexy tomboy Jenna Elfman
(Greg's Dharma)? But there's something about this reasonably funny film
"Keeping the Faith" that leaves a lingering doubt.</P>
<P>For sure the premise is devilishly sweet. Three best friends from childhood:
one becomes a priest (Norton), the other a rabbi (take a guess), the third
an aggressive high-powered business consultant (Elfman). Best buddies as
they worship the big guy, Norton and Stiller are altar-cowboys, inspiring
their respective New York congregations with refreshing zeal and silliness,
but not without a whole heart full of sincerity. This is where the film
radiates. Their friendship, confidence, love, and faith is expressed in a
wonderfully real, non-traditional, humorous, near-MTV, open/honest way. One
Santana-slick scene preaches this message without a spoken word: collar-clad
Norton and yarmulke-topped Stiller saunter down the streets of New York in
variable-slow-mo, donning leather jackets and dark sunglasses as they smile
and great passers-by. You'll love this sequence.</P>
<P>Enter Elfman. After having moved out of the neighborhood at age 13, the
alluring Elfman becomes hesitantly pursued by our two holy men - in a
lightly romantic-comedic, yet forbidden kind of way. This is where the doubt
slips in. The three are great performers, but there's an ever-so subtle
chemistry imbalance. The rapport between Norton and Stiller is so fresh and
exciting and honest - the film slides a baby step backwards in focusing on
Elfman and lover. The trio tangos for position, juggling dedication with
desire and comedy. Don't get me wrong, it's still entertaining ... it's just
that the meaty original story of the hip rabbi and priest simmers on the
back burner as the soapy love triangle bit occupies the screen. Norton's
character puts it aptly, "I feel like I'm in a Spelling TV series ...
'Melrose Priest.'"</P>
<P>Notable other points of remark: The opening five minutes is flatly lame (but
is over soon enough). Norton does a great Rainman impersonation. In smaller
roles, Milos Forman is awesome as elder confidant to Stiller, while Don the
Karaoke salesguy (Ken Leung) is over-the-top hilarious, stealing the screen
from the two top names in his brief appearance as he nails down one of the
films funniest, most memorable moments. I predict we'll see more of him in
the future.</P>
<P>Just a popcorn kernel short of an "A-", you won't have a bad time, but you
probably won't remember this film past Easter/Passover either.</P>
