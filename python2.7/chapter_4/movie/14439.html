<PRE>PERMANENT MIDNIGHT (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: David Veloz
Writer: David Veloz (based on the autobiography by Jerry Stahl)
Starring: Ben Stiller, Maria Bello, Elizabeth Hurley, Owen Wilson, Fred
Willard, Peter Greene, Janeane Garafolo, Cheryl Ladd, Connie Nielsen, Andy
Dick, Jerry Stahl</P>
<P>Being inside someone's mind for about an hour and a half can really fuck
you up, especially if you're in the mind of Jerry Stahl.  Stahl was the
writer of such TV shows as "Moonlighting," and "Thirtysomething," and most
brilliantly"Alf," but more significantly, he was a drug addict making five
grand a week then blowing six grand on drugs.  His bestselling
autobiography, if anything like the book, has got to be one of the most
depressing, alienating book of the 90s, and that's counting Rush Limbaugh's
"See, I Told You So."</P>
<P>Watching "Permanent Midnight" is like watching a giant shapeless blurb on
the screen, framed by a section that tries to make sense of it but just
joins in the shapelessness.  We see Stahl's life from the beginning of his
career to his rapid descent into obscurity then back up again, and half the
time we have no idea where we are.  This would be a major complaint if this
film weren't about a drug dealer who's life was just like this.  His drug
taking was not so much out of pleasure as it was out of just trying to get
the pain of addiction to stop.</P>
<P>Stahl, as played by Ben Stiller, is a selfish, shameless man who just
happens to have a knack for being witty at the right time, but with an acid
edge that makes him funny and a bit of an asswhole at the same time.  Why
he started drug taking, we never find out.  When we first meet him, he's
already hooked onto drugs and takes it just because he physically needs it.
 The first image in the film is of him injecting heroin into his veins in a
public restroom, and we see nothing but pain in his eyes.  He's not
enjoying this ride.  Neither was I.</P>
<P>The framing device of the story is his flashbacks to his life as he tells
an ex-heroin addict named Kitty (Maria Bello, from "ER") in a smarmy motel
room, far from the pleasures of L.A.  As they have sex, and just lay around
talking, he talks of his move out to L.A. where his friend hooks him up
with a neat gig: for a quick payment of 20,000 bucks, he can marry a
British television producer named Sandra (Elizabeth Hurley) so she can get
a green card, and she will give him a writing job on a sitcom called "Mr.
Chompers" (er, "Alf").</P>
<P>He does it, and this allows him to feed his addiction more and more until
everything becomes a big blur.  He shows up late to meetings, arrives high,
and manages to write a script in about a half hour (this explains a lot
about the quality of those shows, eh?).  He injects his own life into his
scripts (his mother commits suicide, and he uses it in his show as a joke),
then ignores them as he does more drugs and has sex with various people. 
He befriends a dangerous dealer (Peter Greene), who is out in the parking
lot outside of the drug clinic where Stahl gets help at.</P>
<P>All of this, including the framing device, comes at you in a blunt,
straightforward manner, something which is totally respectful - hey, not
every film has to be neatly organized and sweetly delivered in a nice
little package - but after awhile, this becomes tedious.  Stiller's
performance is two-edged: he has no problem with showing the true
grittiness of Stahl's persona and lifestyle, but at the same time, he comes
off as a stupid asswhole who has no boundaries and no problem with wasting
other people's time (notably that of a potential agent, played with
hilarious control by Stiller-friend Janeane Garafolo).  It's hard to really
like a guy like this, and it's even harder to sit for an hour and a half
and really care what happens to him.</P>
<P>Overall, I respected this film because it doesn't bullshit anyone about
drugs.  This isn't "Trainspotting," which glorified then trashed drug-use. 
But that film at least gave a reason for people to do it in the first
place.  This one forgets about all that, and just assumes that because the
man is played by Ben "Mr. 1998" Stiller that it'll be easy to really give a
shit happens to him.  Wrong.  I really like Stiller, especially this year
(if you don't think he's a good director, at least after "Your Friends and
Neighbors" you can say he's a brilliant actor), but there needs to be
something else going on that gives me a reason to plow ahead with a film so
murky and overtly depressing.</P>
<P>"Permanent Midnight" is one of those films that will be admired for its
grit, but will never become enjoyable, even with some really nice moments
that either horrify or humor.  There's a really nasty scene where Stahl
tries to inject a syringe into the vein in his neck, and there's also a
really hilarious scene where he tries to come up with some ideas for a new
TV show he's working on, all while being totally high.  These moments, and
the greatness of the acting by pretty much everyone involved, make this
worth watching and plowing through.  But I really doubt I'll ever try to
plow through it again.</P>
