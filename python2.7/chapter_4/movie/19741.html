<P>IN SHORT: An almost outrageous parody of period films</P>
<P>The point of Stiff Upper Lips, a dead on parody of films made by
Merchant Ivory and Miramax, was to take apart the character value of
legendary British reserve, to savage the class structure imposed by the
royalty and upper class upon the lower (or "scum of the earth") class
and, in short, to pop the balloon of overinflated Brit Empire ego. What
the producers wanted to do was apply a Zucker Bros. comedy mentality (a
la Airplane! or The Naked Gun) to Merchant Ivory period piece dramas to
create the kind of Brit humor not seen since the halcyon days of Monty
Python's Flying Circus. Would that they had waited a year to make the
film, for in that intervening year the Zucker Bros. production deal was
terminated, and they could've landed the real thing.</P>
<P>Here's the setup: Facing old maid-hood at the ripe age of 22, young and
fair Emily (Georgina Cates) is introduced to the black-suited,
Latin-spouting bookworm Cedric Trilling (Robert Portal), a friend of her
brother Edward (Samuel West). When sparks fail to fly (and Cedric is
such a priss you'll wonder if he would rather be with Edward) the
matriarch of the family, Aunt Agnes (Prunella Scales) packs everyone up
for a holiday in Italy. Believing that a piece of England should always
be with them, they also pack up the lawn and employ local "scum of the
earth" handyman George (Sean Pertwee) to lug it, and a multitude of
luggage, around.</P>
<P>When he's not packing up the lawn, George is packing up Emily, proving
once and for all that the hired help is usually a man's/woman's best
friend. This, of course, doesn't make Cedric any more attractive for
Emily, so our merry band is off to India, where they guest with Cedric's
right-lunatic great uncle Horace (Peter Ustinov). Horace, in turn,
introduces Agnes to the joys of extra large bathtubs, probably the
funniest jibe on youth oriented period pieces. True, the idea of fat
wrinkled bodies doing the prune thing amidst torrents of bubbles may
turn your stomach, but it's a very funny bit.</P>
<P>And once Emily starts tossing her cookies at breakfast, well, Cedric may
be a priss, but he's of the right class, right?</P>
<P>Stiff Upper Lips, on the whole, is a funny, but not hysterical, take on
English period piece movies. It is slow paced; not the three gags a page
humor that was the standard in Airplane! Sure, half of the jokes in
Airplane! fell flat on their butts, but the audience never had time to
think about it before the next zinger came, um, zinging their way. Stiff
Upper Lips allows you too much breathing room.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Stiff Upper Lips, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$3.00</PRE>
<P>Rental level. Samuel West looks so much like the late Graham Chapman of
Monty Python that you'll wonder why the film didn't capitalize on that
visual connection.</P>
