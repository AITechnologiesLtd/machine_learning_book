<P>The next time you find yourself coming up short on rent day, try this:
Get a few bottles of allergy medicine, head out to the local rave
party and sell the tablets for $20 apiece. Chances are the kids you're
selling it to will already be high and won't notice that the pills
aren't doing anything except opening up their sinuses.</P>
<P>That's Ronna's (Sarah Polley) strategy for avoiding eviction, and it's
typical of the kookiness of "Go," the second feature from director
Doug Liman. Like Liman's first movie, "Swingers," "Go" is propelled by
its quirks and details rather than drama; unlike the generally mellow
"Swingers," however, "Go" zooms through its shaggy dog story with the
same adrenalin rush that dominates its psychedelic soundtrack from
master DJ BT.</P>
<P>If "Go" is reminiscent of Robert Altman's film "Short Cuts" (in which
a couple of dozen Californians of differing social classes turn out to
share common threads), it's considerably lighter in tone.  How grim
can things get when the closest thing the movie has to a villian is a
guy who wears a Santa hat, quotes from "The Breakfast Club" and
deconstructs "The Family Circus"?</P>
<P>This sort of project lives or dies by its casting, and Liman has done
an outstanding job. Polley ("The Sweet Hereafter") and Katie Holmes
("Dawson's Creek") are endearingly earthy as Ronna and Claire, two
seemingly bright young women condemned to waste their days working
endless shifts at the check-out counter of a fourth-rate grocery
store. To add insult to injury, in honor of the Christmas holidays,
the cashiers are forced to wear "Yule Save More" buttons on their
Velveeta-colored aprons.</P>
<P>But Ronna's life becomes a bit livelier when TV stars Adam and Zack
(comedian Jay Mohr and "Party of Five's" Scott Wolf, playing amusingly
against type) come through her line. They're looking to score some
designer drugs before heading to a holiday rave, and, since their
usual dealer Simon (Desmond Askew) is out of town, they turn to Ronna
for help. She, in turn, hightails it to Todd (Timothy Olyphant), the
local drug kingpin, a decision that leads to a traumatic night for all
concerned.</P>
<P>Besides its characters, what elevates "Go" high above the typical
"party picture" - such as"Can't Hardly Wait," for example - is
screenwriter John August's zingy dialogue. As when a guy refuses to
reveal everything about his indiscretions, warning his lover that if
he does, "you will freak out and it will be drama, bad, not-funny
'Roseanne' kind of drama." As when would-be Vegas smoothies Tiny
(Breckin Meyer) and Marcus (Taye Diggs) debate about race and Tiny
insists it's all "a state of mind," Marcus responds by calling him
"Rhythm Nation."</P>
<P>For a fledgling director, getting funding from a major studio on your
second film often means having to compromise the qualities that
originally set you apart from the crowd. The buoyant, sassy and
decidedly unglossy "Go" is proof Liman has managed to avoid that trap.</P>
