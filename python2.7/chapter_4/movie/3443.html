                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>DON JUAN DEMARCO
Starring:  Marlon Brando, Johnny Depp, Faye Dunaway.
Screenplay/Director:  Jeremy Leven.</P>
<P>     Once upon a time, Marlon Brando was considered by many to be
the best American actor in film.  It is difficult to keep that in
mind sometimes, since so many off-screen issues have turned him into
something of an eccentric joke:  his infamous rejection of the 1972
Best Actor Oscar via Sacheen Littlefeather; the massive weight gain;
his stream-of-consciousness turn in APOCALYPSE NOW; most recently,
his televised smooch-fest with Larry King.  Brando has been on the
big screen only a handful of times in the last twenty years, so the
myth has transcended the actor.  That is a shame, because not only
can the man still act, he has shown a great sense of humor about
himself.  Exhibit A:  his hilarious self-parody in 1990's THE
FRESHMAN.  Exhibit B:  DON JUAN DE MARCO, a wonderful romantic
comedy in which the unlikely pairing of Brando and Johnny Depp adds
up to an enchanting fantasy.</P>
<P>     Brando plays Jack Mickler, a psychiatrist at a New York mental
hospital who is just a few days shy of retirement when he comes upon
a most intriguing case.  That case is a young man (Johnny Depp) who
claims he wants to die--and who also claims that he is Don Juan de
Marco, the world's greatest lover.  Mickler is intrigued by the
young man, and asks to treat him until his committal hearing.  Over
the next several days, Don Juan tells Mickler his life story, a
fanciful tale full of love, adventure, tragedy and exotic locations.
Although Mickler questions the veracity of the stories, he finds
himself drawn into them, and inspired to re-discover the romance in
his 30 year marriage to wife Marilyn (Faye Dunaway), and in all
aspects of his life.</P>
<P>     DON JUAN DE MARCO is the kind of story which has been done many
times before--the benevolent eccentric who teaches a lesson to
unhappy realists--but Jeremy Leven works wonders with it wearing
both of his hats.  As writer, he has crafted a screenplay full of
instantly quotable lines.  When Don Juan describes telling his true
love about his 1,500 previous lovers, he explains, "I could see that
the number was substantially more than she was expecting."  The
opening sequence, in which Don Juan seduces a woman in a restaurant,
is also a highlight, full of big laughs.  But as clever a script as
he has at his disposal, it is one of Leven's choices as a director
which makes it something special.  While the narrated flashbacks of
Don Juan's life are given a surreal tinge both by the nature of the
subjects and Don Juan's florid description, the scenes involving
interactions between other characters are almost hyper-real.  The
dialogue is simple, with lines frequently overlapping, and the
camera is usually stationary.  DON JUAN DE MARCO is most about the
beauty of a romantic life, and the manner in which Leven juxtaposes
Don Juan's world with the "real" world is ideal.</P>
<P>     Leven also coaxes two superb performances out of his lead
actors.  Brando is effortless as the run-down Mickler, whose early
connection to Don Juan in the persona of Don Octavio belies his
latent romanticism.  He is marvelously tender in his scenes with
Dunaway, and a riot when he takes a shot at his own girth in a scene
working out with a home exercise unit.  It is a light and very funny
performance, matched and perhaps surpassed by Johnny Depp.  Don Juan
is in the mold of the romantic dreamers Depp has played in films
like BENNY & JOON and ED WOOD, but with a sexual dimension he hasn't
showed previously.  Much of DON JUAN DE MARCO depends on Depp
selling his conviction that the stories he narrates are true, and
his passionate delivery makes it work.</P>
<P>     He works so well, in fact, that several scenes between Brando
and Dunaway probably ended up on the cutting room floor to allow
Depp's character more screen time.  That's something of a shame,
because the film is really about how Mickler changes, and how those
changes re-energize his marriage, and Dunaway is too good to be so
under-used.  However, it is quibbling to fault DON JUAN DE MARCO for
what isn't on the screen, when what is on the screen is so
appealing.  Sweet, funny and unapologetically upbeat, DON JUAN DE
MARCO is a perfect breezy spring entertainment.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 romantic conquests:  8.</PRE>
