<PRE>                              "187"</PRE>
<P>          "187" (pronounced One Eight Seven) we are told is the
California State Penal Code for murder; the term is now used by
gangs all over our lovely country.   Watching the film and seeing
the decline and fall of the U.S. as illustrated by "our" youth is
enough to make one want to throw a net over these young people.
They are lost.  They cannot be rehabilitated.  With all the money
spent on defending our country from perceived enemies, spending to
keep anti-communist dictators in power, and no money for jobs and
housing so that everyone in the country has both, has resulted in
our winning each battle and losing the war.  A pyrrhic victory for
our CIA, our military, our Congress and our Presidents.</P>
<P>          So much for editorializing.  That is not how I write
reviews but this film provoked me into doing just that.  It is
enough for anyone who loves his country, to cry.</P>
<P>          In Brooklyn (where I went to school and where almost all
the teachers even in high school had doctorates) Trevor Garfield
(Samuel L Jackson) is a science teacher, earnest and dedicated.
The class (a euphemism) consists of tattooed, rings in the ears
and nose, "students."   Their sole object is to ridicule, belittle
and denigrate their teachers.   In that atmosphere Garfield tries
to shed a little light.</P>
<P>          Threatened by one of his students (who writes "187" all
over the teacher's books), Garfield brings it to the attention of
a self-serving, keep-my-job and do not raise a fuss, Principal.
The threat has come from a student to whom Garfield had refused a
passing grade.   The Principal pooh poohs Garfield's apprehension.
Shortly thereafter, Garfield is stabbed with what appears to be an
ice pick and he lands, near death in a hospital.  After many
months, he recovers enough to leave Brooklyn and go to the perceived
safety of Southern California.  Hah!</P>
<P>          Garfield quickly learns that it is equally bad in
California.  The schoolhouse is a bungalow.  The students are the
same illiterates he left and they are just as threatening and dangerous.</P>
<P>          At the school he becomes acquainted with a couple of
teachers, Dave Childress (John Heard) and Ellen Henry (Kelly
Rowan).   Dave has been teaching for many years and has given up
on ever being able to impart any knowledge to his students.  He is
"burned out," and is just going through the motions so he can
collect his paycheck.  In between, he smokes and drinks enough to
get crocked. There was a time when he thought he could make a
difference but that was long ago.</P>
<P>          Ellen Henry is fighting a losing battle.   Both she and
Dave look upon Garfield as part hero (having found out about the
stabbing in Brooklyn) and at the same time as someone they cannot
quite fathom.</P>
<P>          When a student becomes too threatening, he is found
dead.   Another student who was always menacingly pointing his
finger in Garfield's face finds himself with a broken finger.
Suspicion falls on Garfield.  Has he taken matters into his own
hands now that he sees there is no other way?</P>
<P>          Up until this point, the film is horrifyingly believable. In about the last 20 minutes, the movie turned sickeningly ludicrous.   I could not believe the denouement I was witnessing.  What were screenwriter (and former substitute
teacher) Scott Yagemann and the Director thinking of?  How could they have Rita (Karina Arroyave) who all picture long wears a ring  in her nose, suddenly appear ringless to do the valedictory speech?   How could everything suddenly turn hopeful?  How could they show the graduating class in cap and gown marching to their seats like normal students when all picture long we saw nothing but misfits?  Give me a break.</P>
<P>Others in the cast include Clifton Gonzalez Gonzalez, Jonah Rooney
and Lobo Sebastian.</P>
<P>Some statistics we are given:  One in nine teachers has been
attacked at school with 90% of the incidents coming from students.</P>
<P>160,000 students stay home from school EVERY DAY because of fear.</P>
<P>Nearly 3 million thefts and violent crimes occur in or near school
each year.</P>
<P>One in five suburban high school boys owns a gun,  40% of them
were threatened and/or shot at while going to school.</P>
<P>Nearly 20% of all students of high school age have carried guns.
Knives or razors  (55%), clubs (24%) and guns (20%).</P>
<P>Nearly 135,000 guns are brought into school each day.</P>
<P>20% of schools report student-on-teacher assaults.</P>
<PRE>          Too bad the movie turned bad in the end.</PRE>
<PRE>                   Directed by Kevin Reynolds.
