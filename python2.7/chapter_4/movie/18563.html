<P>[2.5/4.0]  (dialog in Bengali, English subtitles)</P>
<P>This film, with the English title "The World of Apu", is the final
episode of Satyajit Ray's "Apu Trilogy".</P>
<P>At the end of the narrative of "Aparajito", Apu is left alone in the
world. At the beginning of this story, a few years have passed, but
his fortunes have not much improved. Apu (Soumitra Chatterjee) is
forced to leave college due to the lack of money. Still, his spirit
is not broken. Apu accepts that his life is destined to have hardship,
but that his only recourse is to live it as fully as he can. It is
difficult for him to find a job, so he does private tutoring and
spends the rest of his time working on a novel. He decides to join a
friend, Pulu (Swapan Mukherjee), on a trip to the countryside to
attend the wedding of Pulu's cousin, Aparna (Sarmila Tagore). In a
strange twist of fate, the bridegroom is struck insane so the wedding
must be scrapped. The only way to salvage Aparna's honor is to find a
replacement bridegroom so the wedding can take place. Apu does the
noble thing and marries Aparna. He is not sure that she can be happy
going from a life without need with her parents to a life of poverty
with him, but Aparna makes the best of her fate and thrives in her new
life. Apu is a new man now that he is focussed on married life and he
and Aparna fall deeply in love. Once again, tragedy befalls Apu when
Aparna dies in childbirth. This leave Apu a broken man. Apu then
abandons all parts of his life, including his new son, Kajal, and
embarks on a journey of introspection, hoping to find peace.</P>
<P>Whereas the first two chapters of the trilogy succeed because they
build drama from subtlety, this film is disappointing in its rejection
of that technique. Instead it opts to use melodramatic turns to drive
the story, and force the narrative through wrenching contortions. The
idea that a stranger would step in and rescue an abandoned bride at
her wedding is a standard plot device of Indian cinema. It is slightly
unfair to penalize this film for the years of formulaic overuse in
films that followed it, but still this is a jarring departure from the
simple universal truths of the human condition that the first two films
dealt with. The change in style is so unsettling that the character of
Apu presented here seems a stranger, disconnected from the character
from the previous films.</P>
<P>The pace of the film is exceptionally slow, and while this worked well
in "Pather Panchali", it is a detriment in this film. Obviously the
intent was to show the depths of mourning and levels of introspection
that Apu goes through, but the consequence is the assertion that Apu
grieves over his latest tragedy on a scale that dwarfs the previous
tragedies he had experienced. Perhaps the message being made is that
the dependence on romantic love is far greater than on familial love.
Perhaps it is that tragedies affect adults more than they can affect
children. Neither statement feels credible. One would have expected
that the hardships of his early life would have given Apu some amount
of inoculation for the difficulties of adulthood. Apu actually appears
self indulgent when his reaction to tragedy is compared to how his
mother reacted to similar, if not greater, tragedy.</P>
<P>The wonderful music that backed the other films is surprisingly absent
in this one, outside of a few scenes of Apu playing the flute (a talent
Apu apparently picked up between the previous installment of the story
and this one). Another disappointment is the performance of Soumitra
Chatterjee, which is often overdone, and does not smoothly communicate
the transformations undergone by the character. No other characters are
given much examination.</P>
<P>To be fair, this is a very ambitious film that attempts to deal with
the heavy topics of human emotions. The visual imagery is beautiful
and evocative. It is unlucky in that it is judged by the high standards
set by the masterpieces that preceded it.</P>
<P>Moderately recommended. Although this is not such a bad film on its own,
it is definitely a disappointment after the first two magnificent parts
of the trilogy. The poignancy of those films is replaced here with
melodrama, sometimes overwrought. In fact, nothing from the first two
films needs to be known to understand this one, so it might be best to
see this one first, and then subsequently enjoy the brilliance of the
others.</P>
