<P>Moms around the world understand that there is something about stray
animals and young boys.  The words, "Can I keep him?" have been heard by
mothers almost as much as the words, "I didn't do it!"</P>
<P>Stray animals are one thing.  But how would you like your child to bring
home a 50 foot metal robot from outer space?  Such is the dilemma facing
Annie Hughes (voice by Jennifer Aniston, FRIENDS) in the new Warner
Brothers' film, THE IRON GIANT.</P>
<P>Warner Brothers has certainly improved their animated track record with
this delightfully scripted and imaginatively drawn tale of a boy and his
giant friend.  There is something to please every age group in this film.
In fact, in the screening audience (of which I was a part) was a 50/50
mixture of children and parents.  In most instances, the laughter of the
parents drowned out the higher pitched squeals of the younger set.</P>
<P>Hogarth Hughes (voice by Eli Marienthal, JACK FROST) is your average,
over-imaginative American young boy circa 1957, who is always on the alert
for invaders from Mars, or commie spies.  After hearing a noise coming
from his backyard, and seeing a path of destruction leading into the
woods, he goes out to investigate.  He soon finds the source of the
inadvertent destruction.  A 50 foot metal man/robot leaves quite a wake.</P>
<P>Befriending a giant metal-eating robot is relatively easy.  Hiding him is
something else entirely.  With the help of beatnik/junk dealer/artist Dean
McCoppin (voice by Harry Connick Jr, HOPE FLOATS) Hogarth shows great
ability in keeping his new oversized friend a secret.  But it isn't easy.
The government, hearing of strange occurrences in Hogarth's small town of
Rockwell, has sent a representative, Kent Mansley (voice by Christopher
MacDonald, LEAVE IT TO BEAVER) to investigate.    Soon, the entire army
has been called in to destroy what they perceive to be a menace to the
American way of life.</P>
<P>The script by Tim McCanlies (DANCER TEXAS, POP. 81) is based upon the
characters from the British children's story, "The Iron Man."  The story
has been Americanized and set in the '50s in order to capture some of the
paranoia of the times.</P>
<P>On one level, the movie is about Hogarth teaching the giant that everyone
has the ability to choose who or what he will be.  Though designed as a
weapon of great destructive power, the giant can vow, like Superman, to
only use his powers for good.  Director Brad Bird (FAMILY DOG) apparently
pitched the concept of the movie to Warner Brothers by asking the
questions, "What if a gun chose not to be a gun?  What if a gun had a
soul?"</P>
<P>There are other themes running through THE IRON GIANT.  Friendship,
sacrifice, judging by appearances... But integral to the story is the idea
of an eternal soul that lives on after we die.  Certainly this concept
makes for a sweet and happy story, one that is utilized to great effect in
this movie.  But it does not have the support of scripture.</P>
<P>According to God's own Word, there is nothing eternal about a man's soul.
In Hebrew, the phrase, "living soul" is translated from the words,
"nephesh chay" which are more literally rendered, "breathing creature."
Defined by the scriptures, our soul is literally our breath life... which
ends when we stop breathing.</P>
<P>It is the spirit in man, which is a gift of God and distinguishable from
a man's soul, that is of an eternal and divine nature.  Perhaps it may
sound like splitting hairs or engaging in semantics, but keeping the
distinction between spirit and soul is vitally important for one's
understanding.  Failure to do this has led many to the false doctrines of
spiritualism, magic, reincarnation and a host of other erroneous beliefs.</P>
<P>With that one caveat, I can recommend THE IRON GIANT as a fun,
entertaining and enjoyable film suitable for all ages.</P>
