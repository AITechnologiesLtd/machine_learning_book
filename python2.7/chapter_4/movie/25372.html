<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Few movies in recent times have attracted as much interest in 
Newfoundland as "The Perfect Storm". Showings have been selling out 
regularly since opening day, attracting not only the core movie-going 
teen and young adult populations, but people of all ages. This comes as 
little surprise: for five hundred years, the fate of Newfoundlanders has 
been inextricably linked to the sea. Reports of maritime tragedies are 
not infrequent occurrences on local newscasts, and every Newfoundlander 
is deeply aware of how a poor fishing season can break individual 
fishermen and indeed whole communities.</P>
<P>The subject matter of "The Perfect Storm", then, is near and dear to the 
people of this province. Few films could strike more directly at the 
heart of our communal conscience. Although the Newfoundland economy has 
diversified in the past century -- gone are the days when almost everyone 
was a fisherman, or at least related to one -- tales of fierce storms on 
the Atlantic and loved ones lost in the pursuit of the almighty catch 
still ring true to many.</P>
<P>"The Perfect Storm" is like the mother of such stories: the culmination 
of all those tales of horror and tragedy, made all the more chilling (and 
fascinating) because it is based on real events. It is a fact that around 
Hallowe'en of 1991, three separate weather systems -- Hurricane Grace 
coming up out of the Bahamas, a rainstorm crossing westward across the 
ocean, and a cold front sweeping down from the Arctic -- collided in the 
vicinity of the Grand Banks, the vast fishing grounds off the coast of 
Atlantic Canada and New England. The result was one of the worst storms
ever recorded, and the swordboat "Andrea Gail", out of Gloucester,
Massachusetts, was caught in the middle of it.</P>
<P>"The Perfect Storm" dramatises these events. Billy Tyne (George Clooney), 
skipper of the "Andrea Gail", is a once-great captain fallen on hard 
times. His catch for the season is down badly from previous years. 
Determined to turn things around, Billy and his crew -- Murph (John C 
Reilly), Sully (William Fichtner), Bugsy (John Hawkes), Alfred Pierre 
(Allen Payne), and rookie Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) -- elect to make one more 
trip, all the way out to the bountiful Flemish Cap far to the east. 
There, they enjoy a tremendous catch, until their ice machine breaks down.</P>
<P>The crew is by this time aware of the bad weather lying between them and 
Gloucester, but not its severity. Faced with either waiting until the 
storm subsides (and letting their catch spoil) or punching through it, 
they decide to head home. But the first hints of the storm knock out the 
radio, and so Billy is oblivious to the warnings of a friendly rival 
(Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), that he is heading right into the 
epicentre of a meteorological powderkeg.</P>
<P>"The Perfect Storm" does not get off to a good start. The first half of 
the film moves at a glacial pace, depicting the toll that fishing takes 
on the crewmembers' personal lives. The problem is that none of these 
characters are particularly interesting; the acting, while serviceable, 
is uniformly unremarkable. Though a certain amount of character-building 
is necessary in order to involve us emotionally in the picture, it is 
simply overdone. Too much time is spent developing these characters (and  
not in particularly imaginative ways) than can be justified by the 
relatively insignificant and melodramatic payoff at the end.</P>
<P>The movie is just marking time, until the storm hits the "Andrea Gail" 
and the action really begins. We are therefore forced to endure contrived 
animosity between Murph and Sully, present for no other reason than to 
generate some spark during the early tedium. It says something that the 
most engrossing sequences of the first half have nothing to do with the 
"Andrea Gail" at all, but rather with a small luxury yacht, the 
"Mistral", sailing for the Bahamas and so caught up in the storm earlier 
on. The rescue of the "Mistral"'s crew by a coast guard helicopter is 
genuine edge-of-the-seat material. Indeed, the entire subplot involving
the coast guard unit (which later tracks the "Andrea Gail") generates 
many of "The Perfect Storm"'s best and most heartfelt moments.</P>
<P>Once the "Andrea Gail" and the storm do collide, the intensity of the 
movie finally picks up, and I cannot deny that I enjoyed these scenes 
mightily. Watching Tyne and his crew struggle against nature was both an 
inspiring and heartrending experience: I was already well aware of their 
ultimate fate, but I admired their determination to get back to port. 
These scenes are also nicely counterpointed by tense, quiet glimpses of 
the fishermen's family and friends back in Gloucester, gathered at a 
local tavern and waiting desperately for news while the storm rages
outside.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, while the action in the second hour is undeniably 
riveting, it is marred by poor production values. The computer-generated 
images of the "Andrea Gail" riding the towering waves are certainly 
impressive. But they are also very artificial: the water moves like 
textured jelly, and the boat is lit and outlined in a very unrealistic 
manner. Also off-putting are some of the onboard scenes, especially those 
set after dark, which are clearly shot in a water tank -- it is hard to 
shake the impression that the "ocean" ends about five feet off screen.</P>
<P>Admittedly, the power of the second half of "The Perfect Storm" is almost 
enough to make me forget all this. Almost. Perhaps if I hadn't been 
lulled into such listlessness by the first half, I would have been more 
easily drawn into the fiction. But "The Perfect Storm" is desperately 
unbalanced. The filmmakers should have taken a cue from the title that 
the real star is not the fishermen, but the storm itself. "The Perfect 
Storm" is simply a good disaster movie, in the tradition of "Twister". An 
excellent drama could no doubt be made about the trials of Atlantic 
fishermen, but "The Perfect Storm" is not that movie.</P>
