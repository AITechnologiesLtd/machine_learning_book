<PRE>                                  COLOR OF NIGHT
                       A film review by Raymond Johnston
                        Copyright 1994 Raymond Johnston</PRE>
<P>     COLOR OF NIGHT is yet another derivative serial killer film.  If
you have seen PSYCHO, THE HEARSE, and TOOL BOX MURDERS there is
absolutely nothing new here.  What is unusual is the fact that a truly
fine cast including Bruce Willis, Ruben Blades, Brad Dourif, and Lesley
Anne Warren are trapped trying their best to breath life into the
stillborn double entendres and tired plot cliches of the hackneyed
"mystery." Even action star Lance Henriksen is left with nothing to do
but talk in the endless and very unconvincing group therapy sessions
that make up the bulk of the film.  Willis, as the psychologist, does
the same happy-go-lucky smart aleck tough guy turn he has become famous
for.  The problem is that a psychologist should be sensitive and
understanding, at least professionally.  Blades, Dourif, Warren, and
Henriksen are thinly written cardboard characters.  Blades, who in real
life has a degree from Harvard, does another hot tempered, dim witted
Chicano stereotype.  Dourif, who is awesome in Wise Blood, plays a
obsessive neurotic who keeps counting everything throughout the film.
Some of this is supposed to be funny, but seeing a decent actor in
truly bad make-up given so little to make a character from is merely
sad.</P>
<P>    The only actor who can count this film as a career plus is Jane
March, whose last film was The Lover.  Her character has some depth and
she really does shine on the screen.  The few scenes of her with Willis
are the only ones in the film worth watching, although she is in
relatively little of the film as a character named Rose.</P>
<P>    Much of the plot, however relies on a transparent gimmick that is
poorly executed.  The obviousness of this gimmick destroys any sense of
mystery early on.  One simply waits for the characters on screen to
notice what is painfully apparent.</P>
<P>    Disney, who owns the company that released this film, has cut the
film to an R rating.  No amount of additional scenes, however, could
make COLOR OF NIGHT into a good film.</P>
