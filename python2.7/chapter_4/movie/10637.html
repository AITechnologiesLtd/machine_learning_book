A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Manny Coto</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Manny Coto</PRE>
<P>Starring: Joseph Mazzello, Arthur Burghard, Alex Daniels</P>
<P>Ingredients: 
Preteen boy who is underconfident, talking armored cybersuit from outer
space, evil space monster</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
Spence (Joseph Mazzello) is a young kid who doesn't have much
confidence. He is too shy to talk to the girl he has a crush on. He lets
a school bully harrass him. He is afraid of spiders. His dad doesn't pay
enough attention to him. His sister thinks he's a fungus.</P>
<P>One day Spence befriends a talking armored cybersuit named Cy that
aliens from outer space have stashed on earth for safekeeping. Wearing
the cybersuit gives Spence super powers. At first Spence use the suit to
scare the bully and to spy on the love of his life. But when an evil
space monster called the Brood Warrior kidnaps Cy, Spence must overcome
his many insecurities, rescue Cy, and defeat the Brood Warrior. </P>
<P>Opinion:
The bad news is that for an adult this film would be totally
predictable, and the fight scene at the end would be ten minutes too
long. But the good news is that STAR KID represents the fantasy of
almost every young boy from age 5 to age 12, and it is squeaky clean in
terms of lacking bloodshed, swear words, or frightening material. In
other words, parents, if you want to score quick brownie points with
your male youngster, take him to this movie and call it family hour.</P>
