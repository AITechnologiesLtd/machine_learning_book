<P>     LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES is one of those movies that's so light 
and airy that's it's almost impossible to hate.  Unfortunately, it's 
also terribly predictable, which makes it difficult to like.  In 
addition, the film tries so hard to be hip and trendy that at times it's 
almost painful.  Put that all together and what you get is a pleasant-
but-dissatisfying motion picture that seems to be trying to copy Cameron 
Crowe's SINGLES, but ends up a lot closer to Ben Stiller's REALITY 
BITES.  </P>
<P>     LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES is the most recent in a veritable flood 
of comedies from Australia.  At least this one is a little different in 
temperament and style.  For one thing, the soundtrack isn't saturated 
with '70s songs (nothing by ABBA is even hinted at).  Secondly, few of 
the actors will look familiar.  In fact, for many of them, like for 
director/co-writer Emma-Kate Croghan, this is their first feature.</P>
<P>     The film follows five college students' romantic and academic 
misadventures, concentrating far more on the former than the latter.  
The two characters with the most screen time are roommates Mia (Francis 
O'Connor) and Alice (Alice Garner).  Mia is a lesbian and Alice is 
straight, but they're both having problems with their love lives.  
Fearful of commitment, Mia is pushing her lover, Danni (Radha Mitchell), 
away -- perhaps into the arms of another woman.  Meanwhile, Alice is 
lusting after the seemingly-unattainable Ari (Matthew Dyktynski) while 
being admired from afar by Michael (Matt Day), a shy med student.  There 
are also a couple of subplots going on, one involving a guy who is 
contemplating circumcision to please his girlfriend, and another 
centering on a film studies professor (Kym Gyngell) who is never without 
a donut in his hand or mouth.</P>
<P>     LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES falls into the category of the 
singularly unambitious romantic comedy.  Too many of the jokes fall 
flat, including brief jabs at the fanatical followers of directors 
Quentin Tarantino, Woody Allen, and Spike Lee.  The film has a little 
fun equating the wisdom of philosophers like Nietzche with that pop 
icons like John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and Alfred Hitchcock.  Perhaps 
the best line (although not necessarily the most appropriate) is a quote 
from the famous thriller director:  "Always make the audience suffer as 
much as possible."  </P>
<P>     For the most part, the fresh-faced actors, especially Francis 
O'Connor and Alice Garner, give likable performances.  Unfortunately, 
there isn't much romantic chemistry in evidence, although it's easy to 
envision all these characters as platonic friends.  There's a simple 
playfulness about their relationships that's never effectively 
transformed into heat, even though we have a pretty good idea from the 
beginning who's going to be paired up with whom.</P>
<P>     The best part of LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES has nothing to do with 
romance or relationships.  It focuses on Mia's desperate attempt to 
change classes on the final day of the add/drop period.  One 
bureaucratic mine after another lines her path:  unpaid library fines, 
uncooperative professors, and a computer hacker who demands payment for 
services rendered.  This sequence is about the only spontaneous-seeming 
aspect of the film; the rest of LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES is at least 
a notch below it.</P>
<P>     I suppose Croghan thought she was bringing something new to the 
screen with LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES, although I can't imagine what.  
Admittedly, this is the first Generation X comedy that I can recall 
being photographed through an amber filter, but I don't think that's 
what the director had in mind for her hallmark achievement.  
Unfortunately, that's one of the most memorable aspects of this 
unremarkable film.  LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES isn't funny enough, 
romantic enough, or offbeat enough to distinguish itself from the many 
films it's in direct competition with.</P>
