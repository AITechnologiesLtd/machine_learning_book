<PRE>_My_Dog_Skip_ (PG) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        "Boy and his dog" movies always seem to fly over my head.  Perhaps it's
because I've never been much of a pet person, or more likely it's because
in pandering to everyone from the tykes to the old folks, the cutesiness
is often cloying and the sentimentality is almost always syrupy. 
_My_Dog_Skip_, based on Willie Morris' beloved World War II-era-set 1995
memoir, is guilty of committing both those crimes.  However, while this
family film often follows the traditional mechanics of its genre, the
emotions it elicits feel far from manufactured.</P>
<P>        That isn't necessarily the case in the early stages of _My_Dog_Skip_,
which traces young Willie's (Frankie Muniz) relationship with the titular
canine, whom he receives as a 9th birthday gift from his mother (Diane
Lane).  With the departure of his next-door neighbor and idol, celebrated
former high school athlete Dink Jenkins (Luke Wilson), for military duty,
Skip (whose full name is "Skipper") quickly becomes Willie's new best
friend.  Unsurprisingly, the development of their relationship comes
complete with all the usual precious scenes of Skip trying to drink out
of a toilet and charming the pants off the locals in Yazoo, Mississippi.</P>
<P>        _Skip_ the film takes a longer while to charm its audience, and while
that sounds like a knock, it's actually a compliment.  Despite some
moments of melodrama (such as Dink's slow-mo departure, bombastically
scored by William Ross), director Jay Russell works at a low key, subtly
planting the emotional seeds that come to full blossom by the film's
conclusion, which packs a profoundly poignant punch.  The film's
effectiveness is every bit as much his collaborators' doing as it is his
own.  Although some of the situations he's placed in are cloying, Muniz
never falls into the trap himself; he's remarkably assured
and--crucially--real for child actor.  Ably supporting him are Lane,
Wilson, and, as his war veteran father, Kevin Bacon.  And while a number
of the film's failings fall squarely on her work, scripter Gail
Gilchriest must also be commended, in particular for some lovely passages
of voiceover narration, nicely read by Harry Connick, Jr.</P>
<P>        _My_Dog_Skip_ is a nice film, and its unabashed sentimentality is
certain to lead some viewers to call it too nice.  But that's what makes
it an ideal family entertainment: harmless to the kids, while offering
something deep and valuable for the adults.  _My_Dog_Skip_ is a touching
film with its heart in the right place in a day and age when so many
movies don't have one at all.</P>
