<PRE>                              WINGS OF DESIRE
                       A film review by Lon Ponschock
                        Copyright 1995 Lon Ponschock</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Wim Wenders
Written by Wim Wenders with Peter Handke
Starring Bruno Ganz, Solveig Dommartin, Otto Sander, Curt Bois,
    and Peter Falk
130 mins.</PRE>
<P>     Here is the beginning of the story of Cassiel and Damiel: Guardian
Angels.  This film from 1988 is, for me, the first major work by Wim
Wenders.  His previous collaboration with Peter Handke on Handke's play
called THE ANXIETY OF THE GOALIE AT THE PENALTY KICK goes back to a
period around 1973.  This play had become a modern classic in Germany.
Okay, in Germany it's a classic.  But for me the film treatment was
nothing more than 'another bad European film shot on a budget and meant
to look like *art*.'</P>
<P>     But *here* in Wenders' original 'voice' both in language and film
technique, *here* is a wonderful little film.  To do so much with city
streets, suggestions of costuming, and poetic dialogue is the art of
the master or the genius, who can say which for sure?  I've seen
Wenders' work when it was really BAD too.  An item called NOTEBOOK ON
CITIES AND CLOTHES is still on the current rack at one of the vid shops
around town.</P>
<P>     The camera turns in WINGS do not have the flourish of the more
recent companion piece which is called FAR AWAY SO CLOSE, but here the
director can turn a simple building and it's shape into a place of
magic and wonder.  Observe the library sequences in WINGS to see what I
mean.</P>
<P>     The subject is angels--Guardian Angels--a subject which has come
into vogue over the past two years in America.  There is something very
touching about this.  It tells us that in our heart of hearts we yearn
to not be alone. It is a belief that we want to cherish even though
this is a simple work of fiction.  Because the mind has conceived of
it, it has become it's own reality.   The spirits which the mind
conjures become beliefs or, at the very least, wishes.</P>
<P>     So WINGS OF DESIRE like all the angel shows before it, plays to
these feelings.</P>
<PRE>     And it works.</PRE>
<P>     With a simple detail like a ponytail tied with a string, Wenders
tells us here are the angels ... they see each other when no one else
can and we see them too.</P>
<P>     And there is this: a man is shown in despair.  An angel embraces
him.  Then his inner voice gives him the strength to go on with his
life.  The embrace of the angel ends.  The man sits up and continues on
his journey.</P>
<PRE>     So much with so little.</PRE>
<P>     WINGS OF DESIRE is categorized as a comedy, like it was some sort
of HEAVEN KNOWS MR. ALLISON or HEAVEN CAN WAIT and other such fluff.
There are moments of humor in WINGS to be sure.  But the film is so
much more than that.  So when you see it displayed do not be put off as
I was *for months* because of a judgement that didn't relate to the
work itself.</P>
<P>     Get WINGS OF DESIRE and FAR AWAY SO CLOSE together if at all
possible.  WINGS OF DESIRE is only available at WorldWide Video on
College Avenue in the Marketplace.  FAR AWAY is probably in wider
circulation.</P>
<P>     I'll conclude this rave-up with a small quotation from the film.
Wenders' work is poetic and he speaks to our hearts:</P>
<PRE>       Damiel: "I want to conquer a history for myself
                I want to turn what I have learned
                from my timeless downward-watching
                into sustaining a hasty glance,
                a short shout, an acrid smell.
                I've been outside long enough,
                Absent long enough,
                Out of the world long enough.
                I'll enter the history of the world,
                if only to hold on apple in my hand."</PRE>
