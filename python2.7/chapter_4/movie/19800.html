<P>   Our institutions are flawed.  For moviegoers, that's a
good thing.  If the establishment were perfect, what would we
do for laugh-out-loud screen parodies?  During the
past 12 months we've had a take-off on beauty contests,
("Drop Dead Gorgeous" which turned ugly when it attacked
vulnerable, handicapped people), a send-up of horror movies
("Lake Placid," a thoroughly amusing shark-fest that
underscored the failure of the lame-scripted "Deep Blue Sea"
that followed it), and of karate films (Jackie Chan in "Rush
Hour," as the uncomfortable partner of a motormouth cop). 
The best subject for parody, though, is the movie industry
itself, an enterprise which has been criticized for being
concerned only with money, for dumbing down its subject
matter to bring in the lowest common denominator to the
theaters, and for swamping the multiplexes to such an extent
that a personal film has a difficult time indeed finding a
constituency.  Who better to satirize the studios than one of
the largest studios itself?  </P>
<P>   Universal's "Bowfinger" uses two of the trade's sharpest
comics to turn out a howlingly funny lampoon of big studio
domination.  The film focuses on a producer-director of a
small outfit ironically called Bowfinger International run by
Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin), who hopes to make a movie
with his budget of $2,184, saved by putting $1 a week into a
kitty from the time he was ten years old.  Unfortunately the
actor he wants would probably not consider even looking at a
script for ten times that figure.  This does not stop the title
character, who comes across with a bold idea: superstar Kit
Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) will star in his film without even
knowing that he's in the movie.  How Bowfinger follows the
luminary around the streets of Hollywood, capturing him on
celluloid without the man's awareness. is the concept that
delivers the almost non-stop guffaws and chuckles.</P>
<P>   An original screenplay by Steve Martin himself,
"Bowfinger" is directed by Frank Oz (known to the younger
set as puppet-performer Yoda in "The Empire Strikes Back"
and to hip college kids and others for directing the wonderful
musical parody "Little Shop of Horrors").  The movie opens
as Bowfinger is about to get his phone service cut off for non-
payment.  But Bobby is nothing if not determined, inspired
and disciplined.  Bent on making a low-budget sci-fi entry
about an alien takeover of the Earth entitled "Chubby Rain,"
he enlists his loyal team of actors.  Carol (Christine Baranski)
is well-suited for her nouveau-riche revenge-character role
and screenwriter Afrim (Adam Alexi-Malle) has turned up a
script that Bowfinger considers a masterpiece.  With a
would-be cameraman, he rounds up a crew of Mexicans who
are one step ahead of Immigration and sets out to capture Kit
on his hidden camera.  Kit is the perfect person to play a
man terrified by aliens as he is has a paranoid personality
and is being treated by Terri Stricter (Terence Stamp) at a
luxurious, California-style est-type enterprise called
MindHead.  </P>
<P>  While the comedy hangs together quite well, "Bowfinger"
accommodates a series of fast-moving skits, each of which is
able to stand alone as a Saturday-Nite Live type of
entertainment.  The best minutes in the movie come as
Bowfinger locates the restaurant table occupied by hot-shot
producer Jerry Renfro (Robert Downey, Jr.) and tries
unsuccessfully to get his backing of the film by taking an
adjacent table and speaking loudly on his cell phone,
allegedly to Kit Ramsey--whom Renfro has been unable to
contact.  Heather Graham does wonderful work as Daisy, an
Ohio naif who travels to Hollywood seeking work as an
actress and learns very quickly which people she has to bed
to get a leading role.  Eddie Murphy and Steve Martin make
sparks together with Murphy in the dual role of Kit Ramsey
and Kit's developmentally disabled brother--who declares that
he not only aspires to the job of errand runner but holds that
"running errands would be a boost to my career."  </P>
<P>   The company introduces us to amusing side characters in
brief roles such as one young, untalented woman who turns
up for an audition but is found by Bowfinger to have "the
personality of a zip code in Kansas."  Betsy the dog, who has
been well-trained in obedience, does her part to further terrify
the already paranoid Kit by following him through an indoor
parking garage wearing high-heeled shoes.  Each time Kit
turns quickly around to see the source of the clackety clack,
he observes nothing at all, furnishing him a wide-eyed look of
terror.</P>
<P>   Having spoofed schlock alien films unmercifully and, in a
concluding scene taking aim at Hong Kong martial arts fare,
"Bowfinger" accomplishes its task of mocking the entire
industry of profit-hungry big studios in a movie that will
probably take in sacks of money for the big studio that's
releasing it.</P>
