<P>       *Contact* (or: *Close Encounters of the Hegelian Kind*)</P>
<PRE>               an esthetic and philosophic review</PRE>
<PRE>                          by Brad Aisa</PRE>
<P>There is a scene about half way through the movie *Contact* in which the 
identity of many of the atheists in the audience becomes manifest: they 
erupt into cheers and applause (or at least did on the night I saw the 
movie, being myself amongst the loudest of the cheering applauders). The 
eruption comes in response to a swaggering and bold line uttered by Ellie 
Arroway, the astronomer played by Jodie Foster in the movie.</P>
<P>Ellie is a scientist, and is an atheist for the right reason: the lack of 
evidence for any alleged supreme being. But while Ellie does not believe in 
God, she is nevertheless still a Believer after a fashion, only her belief 
is that other sentient beings exist, and that evidence of their existence 
might be found by monitoring the radio signals impinging on Earth from the 
furthest reaches of the Universe. So monitor she does, at first in Puerto 
Rico (until her director cuts off her funding), then later, at an American 
installation (funded by a wealthy reclusive zillionaire.)</P>
<P>For the first two thirds of the movie, the theme seems straightforward 
enough: reason vs. faith. Ellie is the stalwart defender of reason; her 
nemesis, apart from modern Western civilization in general, is an 
anti-technology cleric/writer played by Matthew McConaughey. (He wanted to 
be a priest, but failed Celibacy 101, as he soon proceeds to demonstrate 
with Arroway...). The two soon part, to be later reunited under completely 
new circumstances: Ellie has discovered a transmission of intelligent 
extraterrestrial origin, and McConaughey is now an advisor to the 
President.</P>
<P>Who is the President? Here we get to the first of the film's several 
serious esthetic flaws. Robert Zemeckis, the film's director, also directed 
Forrest Gump, which employed digital image editing to implant Gump into 
historical scenes involving real presidents and public figures. Zemeckis 
uses this device in *Contact* to cast.... Bill Clinton as the President. To 
this jarring device (you could literally feel the audience squirm) is added 
the now commonplace practice of featuring bevies of real life figures, such 
as Bernard Shaw and Larry King of CNN. This invalid technique is intended 
to achieve a sense of realism, but achieves the opposite. What actually 
happens, is that the introduction of real life journalistic and 
"documentary" elements -- as opposed to an artistic fictional rendition of 
the elements -- serves, by destroying the "fourth wall", to spotlight the 
fictional nature of the film, and shatter the illusion of the narrative. </P>
<P>The choice of "casting" Clinton also detracted from several scenes in the 
movie, in which, dramatically, the president would be expected to be 
shown, but which we assume was not possible, due to the limited screen time 
and contexts that could be devoted to this device. The technology used here 
is so good, I thought during the film, that Bill Clinton had actually 
participated in the production, playing himself in his scenes. It was 
only later that I came to realize, from reading a commentary on the film in 
Entertainment Weekly (July 18, 1997), that the scenes with the President 
were merely assembled from public footage, not via his cooperation. (This 
itself is highly improper, since it expropriates the President's visage.)</P>
<P>The message received by interstellar fax contains the blueprint for 
building a giant machine, that seems designed to transport its single 
occupant ... to??? ... how??? The interstellar fax apparently didn't come 
with the sender's address. Nevertheless, over the objections of the 
cliche-paranoid National Security Advisor (played by James Woods), an 
international consortium is convened to build the machine, and a committee 
established to select the occupant.</P>
<P>Several plot twist and turns ensue, but through it all, up to the launch, 
we remain convinced that the theme ("message" might be more apt) is reason 
vs. faith, or better: reason vs. whacked out American-style New Age 
mysticism and fanaticism, as depicted both chillingly and hilariously, in a 
garish New Age campout around the radio telescope site, comprising every 
conceivable fringe or whacked out subgroup in America; a similar spectacle 
is enacted in Washington. Arroway drives through this, and we acutely feel 
her pain at witnessing the spectacle -- her most triumphant achievement has 
been reduced to the level of Elvis worshippers (apparently anticipating his 
resurrection), fundamentalist doomsday sects, and crazy alien worshippers.</P>
<P>(It shouldn't be giving away too much to let the reader guess who finally 
gets to make the voyage...) The voyage at last takes place, and the 
occupant returns. And it is not only the occupant of the craft who 
gets to take a voyage, by the way: the audience itself gets transported 
back almost 30 years, as well, made to endure the nearly identical sequence 
from 2001: A Space Odyssey -- but I digress.</P>
<PRE>Sigh.</PRE>
<P>It is this sequence, and the scenes which ensue as a consequence, that 
leads one to realize that the movie *Contact* is a supreme fraud -- a kind 
of cheap, third rate philosophic Trojan Horse, in which a philosophically 
illiterate and particularly offensive "message" is delivered that purports 
to unify and transcend the prior thematic conflict of reason vs. faith.</P>
<P>"Reason and faith are just two aspects of the same thing." "Those who 
believe in God have as much justification as those who believe in 
science." "Belief in science is just a matter of faith." Ad nauseum.</P>
<P>It all happens so suddenly, the rational viewer will be a bit taken aback, 
but if he or she rewinds somewhat, the setup and intention becomes clear. 
What one sees, is a plot constructed with such artifice, such implausible 
(nay, impossible) premises, and designed with such specificity to lead to 
such an absurd conclusion, that it is *not* reason and logic and facts and 
evidence and every other hallmark of the scientific method and rational 
mode of existence, which the filmmakers are trying to express.</P>
<P>What we have here, is nothing short of Hegel as E.T.: friendly 
cosmic aliens who would eschew the label "God", but who nevertheless 
consider it important to send their only begotten visitor to return 
to earth and resolve and unite the antagonists of the ages. </P>
<PRE>   Thesis</PRE>
<P>     Faith is the proper means of accepting knowledge; a belief in God
     and an immortal soul is the proper world view for man.</P>
<PRE>   Antithesis</PRE>
<P>     Reason is the proper means of deriving knowledge; a scientific
     world view is the one proper to man.</P>
<PRE>   Synthesis</PRE>
<P>     Reason is faith; God and Science are one; a scientist and a 
     religious prophet are equivalent. Act accordingly.</P>
<P>I have to confess, that it has been a long time since I was as offended at 
the movies, as in the scene in which, by very clear parallel to an earlier 
scene, we are expected to accept that the crazed religious mob, who are now 
worshipping Ellie as a kind of New Age Messiah, are to be *accepted* for 
doing so on nothing more than faith. This is obscene. Also offensive, is 
the staged ambiguity of the disposition of a crucial fact near the end of 
the story, and an epilogue, in which the newly reconstructed Ellie feeds 
the final Synthetic message to a cadre of happy little school kiddies.</P>
<P>I will give the movie credit for its virtues. First, Jodie Foster, always 
eminently watchable, is engaging and touching as the driven, but somewhat 
naive scientist Ellie. Ellie is at home with the machinery of science, and 
fellow scientists, but seems to lose her confidence and some of her 
certitude when she has to deal with less rational individuals.</P>
<P>The production design, directing, and cinematography are all excellent, 
making the movie, on its own terms, enjoyable to watch. And apart from some 
logical flaws that only a reviewer might fault, it does manage to present 
science and its accoutrements as exciting, and comprehensible. I especially 
liked the design and technology of the Machine. The loopy 2001-style 
journey, however, and ridiculous ensuing encounter left me cold. If the 
writers/producers had not been so intent on delivering their Hegelian 
Sermon From the Camera Mount, they might have presented some original, 
memorable, and even controversial encounter/discovery. (What would have 
been wrong with, "Religion? Nah -- we abandoned that three hundred and 
forty-thousand years ago -- tell everyone there is no God, and to get a 
life.") As presented, it is a hokey amalgam of Star Trek's Holodeck, and a 
sentimental attempt at closure of the movie's earlier childhood scenes with 
Ellie and her father.</P>
<P>I must give credit where due, though. Despite all my complaints and 
rantings, I still recommend that you see *Contact*, because it deals with 
*ideas*, and this is such a rare feat in a Hollywood movie, that one 
relishes the fact, even if one is intellectually ballyhooing some of the 
actual content. And *Contact* does not seem to be malicious or evil -- like 
many people, institutions and cultures today, it is just highly confused, 
and trying to find its way in a big, boisterous, sometimes puzzling world.</P>
