<PRE>                          CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER
                       A film review by Chris Klecker
                        Copyright 1994 Chris Klecker</PRE>
<P>Starring   Harrison Ford and William Dafoe</P>
<P>     "How dare you, sir!" Harrison Ford yells near the end of the film,
that has us all screaming, "Yes! Yes! Yes!"  After enduring about two
hours of watching Jack Ryan getting pushed around like some shopping
cart we get to witness Ford's irresistible anger as he lays it all down
on the President.  Amidst the amount of political garble and CIA
research, CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER delivers yet other tally for the Tom
Clancy chalkboard.</P>
<P>     CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER is about a successful drug dealer who
orders the death of two senators, one being the President's friend.  So
now in a fit of rage the President announces that there in a fact a
clear and present danger in Columbia and against all drug dealers from
Columbia.  The book was in fact based in Mexico instead of South
America, however it really makes no difference in this movie.  After
the President makes his speech, he takes $650 million that was issued to
them to help stop the drug cartel in Columbia with strict orders not to
use any military or troops to fight the war on drugs.  Ryan answers
back with, "No troops."</P>
<P>     So now it gets interesting.  With Ryan's word, the President break
the promise and uses the money to finance a small army that is under
strict cover from any outside sources.  William Dafoe's character is an
ex-marine and heads the mission personally from Columbia.  Dafoe's army
conquers a few planes and factories when suddenly a hit on a house
become futile.  Ryan hears the news and immediately becomes suspicious.
Suddenly the army is cut off and now Ryan has to choose what's more
important: The elimination of drugs or the truth.</P>
<P>     CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER is far better than PATRIOT GAMES, but not
as cunning and resourceful as THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER.  Nonetheless,
Danger gives Ford another notch in his almost perfect movie record.
Not only is CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER interesting, but automatically
assumes that the audience is in fact smart enough to know what's going
on.  Moreover, watching Ford down the President like it was his job was
well worth the $6.50.</P>
