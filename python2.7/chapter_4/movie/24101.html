<PRE>KEEPING THE FAITH
A film review by David N. Butterworth

<P>        Have you heard the one about the priest, the rabbi, and the
prostitute?  Of course you have.  Well now you can *see* the one about the
priest, the rabbi, and the workaholic.  It's called "Keeping the Faith" and
it's a romantic comedy about this comely threesome, firm friends in the 8th
grade who come together one wacky weekend and hooboy don't you know it the
two guys wind up falling for the same girl.  Edward Norton ("Fight Club")
is the priest, Ben Stiller ("Mystery Men") is the rabbi, and Jenna Elfman
("EdTV") is the corporate "plumber" (she talked McDonalds out of the
McOyster) and the object of their conflicted affections.  Conflicted in the
sense that Norton's character shouldn't be feeling this way, being a member
of the cloth an' all, and Stiller's character should be dating a Nice
Jewish Girl from the Bronx, not some fast-talking west coast blonde who's
surgically attached to her cell phone.  Stuart Blumberg's script touches on
the struggles between serving your god and servicing your woman, but since
this is a romantic comedy the emphasis leans more towards big laughs, of
which "Keeping the Faith" serves up plenty.  The film is perhaps too long,
and there's a strange anti-climax when Norton's character professes his
love for Elfman's.  Nevertheless, it's very watchable, with Stiller
typically engaging and Elfman as cute as a button.  Norton is
underutilized, but that's probably due to the fact that he serves triple
duty on this film, as co-producer and director as well as one of the
principals--arguably, "Keeping the Faith" was not the best choice for
Norton's debut behind the camera since the young up-and-came-already actor
fails to impose any kind of unique stamp on the rather deliberate
screenplay.  What we have here is an extended episode of "Dharma and Ben
and Ed" with a religious bent.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.</P>
