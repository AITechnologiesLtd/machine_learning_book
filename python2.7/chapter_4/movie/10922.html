<PRE>                         STARSHIP TROOPERS 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon

<P>Disappointment will adequately describe how I felt as I left the cinema
after watching this greatly anticipated film. This movie carried much
potential for greatness, but alas was ruined by a moronic, cliché'
script and a lack of serious direction from Paul Verhoeven. The end
result is not a tense sci-fi, action thriller, but becomes a boy
scout/girl guide venture into trying to define the difference between a
citizen and a civilian. If this was intentional, it subtracts from the
otherwise splendid visual effects of unprecedented alien quality. I've
never read the Robert Heinlein novel on which this movie is loosely
based, but I'm almost certain that the threat to the human race was not
in any way meant to be intentionally comic.</P>
<P>This group of immature actors has gone to great lengths in perfecting a
blood-curdling death scream, but unfortunately their efforts are wasted.
The frequent decapitations, limb amputations, torso dissections and
disembodiment is all for naught. My reason for making such comments is
because after watching the 20th person in the long line of innumerable
graphic deaths - desensitisation becomes inevitable. When the 30th human
execution approaches, variety begins to run thin. By this time caring
about what happens to this group of hormonally charged individuals is no
longer an issue. They are after all only post-pubescent,
soldiers-in-diapers who make a lot of noise over everything. They're
purpose is solely to shoot and get shot, but mention the word act and
they'll just nervously finger their guns.</P>
<P>So what we have is something of a CLUELESS in space, pretentious in
every way with no substance underneath. Add a show tune and you may even
get something of a JOSIE AND THE PUSSYCATS. The ‘Ken doll' (Casper Van
Dien) is all brawn and no brains. He joins the dispensable army corps so
that he can impress his ‘Barbie' girlfriend (Denise Richards) who wants
to fly a star ship. Then there is the nerdy ex-Doogie Howser (Neil
Patrick Harris) whose psychic powers allows him to communicate with
brainy bugs. Throw in a forlorn, other female, Dizzy (Dina Meyer) and
this completes the love triangle of cosmic soap opera proportions.</P>
<P>So why haven't I frowned on this movie like I should have? Well because
it's attempts at being serious made me laugh, and even if it wasn't a
dramatic masterpiece, it serves well as a trashy soapie.</P>
