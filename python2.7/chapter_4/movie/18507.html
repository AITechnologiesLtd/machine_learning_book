<P>Julio Medem's poignant, unconventional "Lovers Of The Arctic Circle"
is a film that shows the viewer the earthshaking power of destiny. The
film stars Najwa Nimri and Fele Martinez(both of whom starred in this
year's other Spanish import "Open Your Eyes") as Ana and Otto, two
people with palindromic names who are destined to be lovers. We learn
of their destinies through a series of coincidences; coincidences that
Ana says, through voice-over, make up her entire life.</P>
<P>When Ana meets Otto, her father has just died, and she believes that
his soul has crossed over to this boy. Fate then works in mysterious
ways, making her mom and Otto's dad fall in love. While she is still a
child, she only looks up to Otto in a paternal way.</P>
<P>Otto, however, is love-stricken from the first time he sees Ana. His
parents have just gotten a divorce and he is going through problems of
his own. Otto and Ana bond together in their time of loss, creating a
kinship based on empathy.</P>
<P>As they become teenagers, their relationship becomes sexual, and they
must try to hide their affairs from their very naive parents. As they
get older, though, they begin to drift apart. The inevitable tragedy,
foreshadowed in the film's first scene, draws nearer.</P>
<P>Writer/director Julio Medem crafts a highly poetic love story; one
that spans the circle of life.  "Lovers Of The Arctic Circle" gives an
entirely new spin on the age-old tale of tragic romance.  The camera
work is wondrous and the characters are vivid. "Lovers Of The Arctic
Circle" gets my full recommendation.</P>
