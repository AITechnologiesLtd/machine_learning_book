<P>Andrew Bergman, director of two of the brightest comedies of the '90s, 1992's 
"Honeymoon in Vegas" and 1994's "It Could Happen to You," has fallen on 
desperate times lately, first with the 1996 Demi Moore debacle, "Striptease," 
and now with "Isn't She Great," a rather cartoonish biopic of 
struggling-actress-turned-trashy-writer Jacqueline Susann. Susann, who looked 
nothing at all like Bette Midler, died at the age of 53 in the mid-1970s of 
breast cancer, but before her death became an icon for the general public, 
not because her writing was particularly good, but because it told the 
absolute truth. All she wanted was to be happy and successful, something she 
never found in her acting career, and according to the movie, it was her 
devoted husband, Irving Mansfield (Nathan Lane), who originally suggested she 
write a book. Susann is a bit hesitant at first, but after writing a brazen 
little number that tells it solely like it is, "Valley of the Dolls," and 
managing to sell it to a publishing company, it quickly tops the charts and 
stays there for 28 weeks, becoming the best-selling novel of all time.</P>
<P>What the public didn't know about, however, was that Jacquelyn's son was sent 
to an institution after being labeled Autistic, and that she struggled with 
cancer for many years. No one would buy a trash-talking book by a cancer 
patient, Susann though, so she hid it from everyone except her husband and 
the doctors, going in on a regular basis for chemotherapy. She ultimately 
lost her battle with the illness, but as she set out to do, was a star by the 
time she passed away.</P>
<P>Uplifting? Maybe a little. An appropriate story to build a wacky, fluffy 
comedy around? No way. Although any genre can surely be placed around any 
storyline and still be successful, it takes a firm, sure touch to sometimes 
pull it off. That is just one of the things that screenwriter Paul Rudnick 
(1997's "In & Out") is consistently missing in his disrespectful treatment of 
Susann, as he paints her as a crazy woman who talked to trees and thought it 
was God peering through the branches when the sun was shining. The only way 
to keep such a breezy tone and work, I think, would probably to have 
transformed the piece into a musical, a 'la "Evita." There are two scenes 
that are perfect setups for music numbers (and one of them actually does have 
Midler singing), and it is a missed opportunity that Rudnick did not realize 
this. Apparently, his brain was on autopilot while he penned the sloppy 
screenplay, anyway.</P>
<P>Worse yet is filmmaker Bergman. Plainly put, "Isn't She Great" is an 
astoundingly inept piece of direction, a surprise coming from someone who has 
proven his talent in year's past. From the schmaltzy narration by Susann's 
husband, Irving, to the episodic, bare-bones editing that seems to dwell on 
minor happenings in her life and then bypasses the most important elements, 
the film is never involving or emotionally satisfying because Bergman often 
seems to be too busy saying, "Look at Jackie Susann! Isn't she great?! Isn't 
she wacky?! Isn't she wild?!" Susann is only sporadically pulled out of her 
caricaturized character, and it is when she is (usually while she is telling 
things, no-holds-barred, exactly how they are) that the movie gets the little 
bit of charm that it acquires.</P>
<P>We rarely are able to believe anything in the film because of the 
unbelievable way in which it is presented. When Irving Mansfield, a publicity 
agent, spots Jacquelyn Susann on the stage, and then meets her in a 
restaurant, they end up spending the day together, with him confessing his 
undying love for her by the time night falls. It should be noted that they 
are standing waist-deep in a lake when this "touching" scene is played out, 
because Susann had just halfheartedly attempted suicide. Soon, they are 
married, but their relationship seems to be nothing more than close 
confidantes, as we never see them in bed together, or even kiss. And how are 
viewers to take it when Susann is earnestly talking to a tree in Central Park 
in one scene, and receiving radiation in the next? It simply does not work, 
and any cast or crew member should have discovered this when they read the 
script, unless they were all in it for the money and did not care about 
faithfully preserving the life of Susann.</P>
<P>Bette Midler overacts her way through the picture, but remains spunky and 
full of energy, thus making the proceedings a little more entertaining than 
they might have been had someone else been cast in the role. She can do far 
better, however, so let's hope that her next film, "Drowning Mona," being 
released next month, is a step up for her. Nathan Lane is a good sport as 
Irving, but usually is playing the straight man to Susann's bigger-than-life 
personality. Stockard Channing, as Susann's best friend, Flo, is a standout, 
spitting out her flashy lines with delightful panache. David Hyde Pierce, as 
Susann's editor; John Cleese, as her publisher; and Amanda Peet, as her 
promotional assistant, are mostly wasted, although Pierce gains a little 
extra mileage in the scenes where he sits down to edit the novel, only to get 
every one of his requested changes rebuked by Susann.</P>
<P>It is truly unfortunate that Rudnick sat down to construct a biopic of 
Jacquelyn Susann and could find nothing worthwhile to write aside from a 
string of one-liners, some of which are sharp zingers, to be sure, but do not 
aid in saying anything insightful about its subject. With only a brief glance 
at "Isn't She Great," which always feels like the outline to a movie, rather 
than a fully written motion picture, one thing is obvious: making the story 
of Jacquelyn Susann into a wistful comedy, albeit a badly made one, was an 
arbitrary, offensive decision, as many of the developments in her life were 
anything but a barrel of laughs.</P>
