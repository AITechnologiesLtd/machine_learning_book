<P>     Don't make the mistake of assuming that "187" is gritty, urban
classroom drama in the mold of DANGEROUS MINDS.  Yes, it does deal with an
inner city teacher (Trevor Garfield, played by Samuel L. Jackson), and it
does deal with his attempts to get through to certain of his students.
But this story isn't about the amazing power of dedicated teachers to
effect change in the face of socio-economic hardships and an oppressive
tie-in soundtrack.  No, "187" is about a man's descent into madness.
"187" is a horror movie.</P>
<P>     At least that's what it _should_ have been.  You see, it turns out
that while teaching at a Brooklyn high school, science teacher Garfield
found himself on the wrong end of a disgruntled student's ten-penny nail.
Fifteen months later, he attempts to get back on the horse by going to
work as a substitute at a run-down Los Angeles school.  Unfortunately,
Garfield discovers that things aren't much different from coast to coast
-- every teacher fears the threat of student violence (187 is a police and
gang code for homicide), and every administrator fears the threat of a
lawsuit.  And in his own mysterious way, Garfield sets out to guarantee
that the inmates will not run this particular asylum.</P>
<P>     Samuel L. Jackson seems pefectly clear about the critical theme of
"187."  For most of the time he is on the screen, Jackson generates a
tension which threatens to explode at any moment.  His performance is raw
and haunting, like a priest experiencing a crisis of faith.  You keep
watching "187" because Garfield's response to his crisis is chilling and
provocative:  he sees his best option as becoming the devil. </P>
<P>     Credit Jackson with an insight screenwriter Scott Yagemann and 
director Kevin Reynolds both lack.  Yagemann's script -- full to bursting
with good teachers (Kelly Rowan) and bad teachers (John Heard), good
students (Karina Arroyave) and bad students -- fairly yanks the outrage
out of us with pliers, dwelling on the unconscionable conditions and trite
confrontations.   Reynolds, meanwhile, perhaps in an attempt to create an
atmosphere of surreality, opens up the film school grab-bag -- dizzying
360 degree tracking shots, blurred focus, black-and-white video footage,
jittery hand-held camera work, slow motion, rust-tinged cinematography.
It is a dreadfully misguided choice.  Every flashy gimmick proves
distancing and distracting, pulling us away from the painful reality of
Garfield's life.</P>
<P>     It's clear that the makers of "187" want to leave viewers angry and
frustrated.  And they succeed, though not in the way they intended.  We
don't need another film to drag us into the classroom to show us how bad
things are.  We don't need another film to lecture to us, or to try to
impress us with cinematic puffery.  "187" is frustrating because it had
the chance to be unique, to pull us into the psyche of a man operating on
sheer survival instinct.  Only in a riveting climax do we ever get a
chance to see Garfield in his darkest moments, as Reynolds and Yagemann
create a pointless did-he-or-didn't-he mystery.  This could have been the
urban high school film which has been begging to be made for years, one
which avoids inanely and simplistically describing that world as "gritty"
or "tough."  The appropriate word is "terrifying."  The appropriate mood
is horror.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 _really_ dangerous minds:  5.</PRE>
