<PRE>                         IF I DIE BEFORE I WAKE
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>Pity poor Muse Watson.  Ever since those darn kids ran him over with
their car in I Know What You Did Last Summer, he just hasn't been right
in the head.</P>
<P>This time out, he and his ultra-redneck brothers are invading an Ohio
suburb -- God knows why -- hell bent on destroying everyone and
everything inside a lonely house at the end of the street.</P>
<P>For nearly 80 minutes Muse and his crew terrorize this poor suburban
family, but little do they know the teenage LoriBeth (Stephanie Jones)
is ready to take them on, and she'll turn anything into a weapon of mass
destruction -- chairs, knives, fireplace pokers, shards of glass, even
the gunpowder emptied from a shotgun shell.</P>
<P>Most of the film consists of LoriBeth running, hiding, climbing, and
fighting off the predators -- including two memorable trips up the
chimney.  While she manages to get on an Internet chat board to beg for
help, the phone never seems to be an option for her (note to LoriBeth: a
modem can dial 911, too).</P>
<P>While it's uninspired, If I Die Before I Wake is often genuinely
thrilling, and writer/director Brian Katkin surprises us by killing off
plenty of bad and good guys alike.  For her part, the nubile Jones seems
to be making a living off movies like this (and, for example,
Rumplestiltskin), and she's fun enough to watch whether she's shimmying
under the bed or across the roof.  Someone give this girl some
legitimate work, will ya?</P>
