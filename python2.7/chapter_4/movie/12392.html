A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Daisy V.S. Mayer</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: David C. Johnson</PRE>
<P>Ingredients: Nerdy law clerk, wild dream girl, night on the town</P>
<PRE>Starring: 
Jada Pinkett Smith, Tommy Davidson</PRE>
<P>Synopsis:
A party-loving hot babe named Woo (Jada Pinkett Smith) finds out from
her astrologer that she is fated to fall in love with a Virgo. Her
friends fix her up on a blind date with an unexciting law clerk named
Tim, but Tim turns out to be a Virgo, so Woo consents.</P>
<P>The rest of the movie portrays what happens during their night on the
town. The two don't get along because Woo feels that Tim is boring and
uptight, and Tim is upset about his car getting stolen, and getting
punched out at a club. Woo also doesn't like the fact that Tim's macho
buddies make fun of him. </P>
<P>Will they stick with each other despite a trying night?</P>
<P>Opinion:
WOO portrays the main couple as being totally incompatible but for a
dubious astrological connection. However, the chemistry's okay between
Jada Pinkett Smith and Tommy Davidson. </P>
<P>Will Tim lighten up? Will Woo accept Tim? Will they temporarily break up
and then starting reminiscing about the good things they saw in each
other? You already know the answer. The slapstick is entertaining
(restaurants and cars get busted up, people dressed in yellow chicken
suits) but the film is unremarkable in that it feels like we've seen
these stretches of drama and slapstick before. </P>
