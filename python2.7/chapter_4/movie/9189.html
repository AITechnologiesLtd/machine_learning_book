   Paul Thomas Anderson, who wrote and directed "Boogie
Nights," is just twenty-six years of age.  This is only his
second feature, made shortly after a fine independent work,
"Hard Eight," which had limited success at the box office.  Yet
already there are signs that Anderson could be our next
Martin Scorsese.  Without taking credit away from two other
youthful directors, Harmony Korine ("Kids" and "Gummo") and
Sal Stabile ("Gravesend"), Anderson is something else.  He
seems to have transcended the world of the small indy work
for which Stabile has just made a name--the sort of stuff that
Harmony Korine does not romanticize but describes as "the
same as studio films but cheaper, so they look worse." 
"Boogie Nights" features lenser Robert Elswit's flamboyant
cinematography, a delightfully garish production design by
Bob Ziembicki, and some fine, on-site shots of Los Angeles
which could give a foreigner watching the film the impression
that the whole town is a big, adult Disneyland made for
snorting, partying, and dealmaking.
   "Boogie Nights," a title derived from the name of a dazzling 
night club, deals with the porno industry in L.A. from 1977 to
1984, and while this controversial form of adult entertainment
is certainly not glossed over or used simply as metaphor, the
enterprise is exploited as an example of family values.  Jack
Horner (Burt Reynolds), a well known, successful director of
adult films, is the sort of fellow who might be considered a
sleaze-bag by those who disapproves of his movies and who
do not know the man.  Yet as portrayed by Mr. Anderson in
this startling, original and daring film, Horner is a good family
man who welcomes outcasts into his extravagantly designed
estate and acts as surrogate father to those who are unable
to find places of warmth that they could call their homes.  The
folks who do the dirty deeds in front of Horner's camera
perform their hard-core sexual acts openly and before the
eyes of a dozen or so onlookers, yet they consider their
behavior no more scandalous than they would social dancing. 
Yet Horner, ever the craftsman, will not tolerate indifferent
work but insists they show passion for what they are doing.
   While "Boogie Nights" possesses a strong plot and is not
simply character-driven, Anderson has furnished each of his
principals with solid and individual personalities.   Dirk Digger
(Mark Wahlberg), as he becomes known, is the young stud
whom Horner finds bussing in a restaurant, immediately
recognizes his potential for the trade, and makes him a star. 
An uneducated, naive lad suffering from putdowns by his
terrible mother (Joanna Gleason), he finds affection and
success as the sexual partner of Amber Waves (Julianne
Moore), who becomes the seventeen-year-old's surrogate
mother.  Others who inhabit the Horner estate include Little
Bill (William H. Macy), an aging assistant who does a slow
burn over his own wife's promiscuity; Buck Swope (Don
Cheadle), who insists that he is a bona fide actor and dreams
of opening a hi-fi store; Rollergirl (Heather Graham), a high-
school failure who demands respect from her sexual partners;
Maurice TT Rodriguez (Luis Guzman) as Dirk's chief
supporter and co-actor; and The Colonel (Robert Ridgely),
who finances the projects.
   Anderson has no problem mixing dark and serious
concerns with comic vignettes, breaking away from Horner's
filming studios to uncover scenes of particular poignance,
hilarity, and violence.  The film sprawls out increasingly so
that during the second half it virtually breaks up into a pursuit
of individual dramas only to come together during the closing
moments--revealing its characters with both optimistic and
tragic outlooks.  Yet Mark Wahlberg firmly centers the movie
as the school dropout who is discovered by Horner, succeeds
as a porno star beyond his wildest imagination, and devotes
his years to pornography, partying and living in palatial
splendor (his vast wardrobe is arranged according to
designers), until his ego gets the best of him.  Even James
Bond gets sent up in a series of short films starring Dirk as a
Bond-type character whose prowess with women leaves
nothing to the imagination.  Nudity is flaunted from time to
time, yet discretion by the camera allows the film to avoid an
NC-17 rating.  
   One scene is a classic of 1990s film-making, a model of
anarchic hilarity.  When Dirk and two of his buddies go to the
home of drug dealer and compulsive user Rahad Jackson
(Alfred Molina), violence ensues, but not before Molina turns
in some side-splitting shtick as an easy-going fellow who just
wants to party throughout the day.  Burt Reynolds turns in
perhaps his best character role ever as Jack Horner, ably
assisted by Julianne Moore as his leading lady of lechery,
with a particularly good performance by Heather Graham as a
free spirit who has found warmth in the home of a porno king
but whose lack of education catches up with her.  And Mark
Wahlberg, hardly a household name, with films like
"Renaissance Man" and "Fear" in his resume, will emerge a
star.
   Director Paul Thomas Anderson probably cares no more
about the porno industry than Martin Scorsese cares about
boxing.  Like Scorsese, Anderson believes that form and
emotional design are more important than the facts of the
industries they study, and are far more involved with making
personal journeys into the hearts of their characters. 
Anderson has chosen his time period well, the early eighties,
symbolic of greed and drugs and other forms of excess
throughout the country.  (It's no coincidence that Ronald
Reagan's picture figures prominently in one scene.)  For all its
gloss--its throbbing soundtrack and exploitation of a libidinous
enterprise--"Boogie Nights" is a work of art, an unusually
vigorous work and exceptional accomplishment for its 26-
year-old creator. Rated R.  Running Time: 152 minutes.  (C)
