<PRE>FIGHT CLUB
(1999)</PRE>
<PRE>Reviewed by Jack Choo
Directed by David Fincher
Starring : Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham-Carter
Rating : ****1/2 out of *****</PRE>
<P>FIGHT CLUB is Finchers third movie outing and with every film, he seems to
out-do himself in style and technical filming. In SEVEN, his dark shots sets
the standard for possibly one of the moodiest Hollywood film ever. In THE
GAME (with Michael Douglas and Sean Penn), Fincher continues his penchant
for technical mood only this time, blended with action sequences. With FIGHT
CLUB, he explores CGI and the impressive Virtual Camera (used to much
success in THE MATRIX) interlaced with his trademark stylized dark shots.</P>
<P>The story revolves first-perspective, around Jack (Norton), who has been
suffering insomnia for quite some time. In his desperate state to solve this
problem which is affecting his career and social life, he enrols into
various support-groups. The problem is, the support groups do not support
directly his problem; he involves himself in groups supporting
testicular-cancer, AIDS and many others. Somehow, the talking and the crying
involved in the groups helped him to sleep well at night. Before long, they
became his addiction; attending them everyday after work. However, the
effect disappeared when he discovers another person, Marla Singer (Carter),
who attends all these groups as well, apparently with similar intentions.</P>
<P>He befriends Tyler Durden (Pitt) during one of his business trips and
unknowingly makes a friends who will change his life forever. Tyler is into
soap making, well at least thats one of his weird forte. Jacks life takes
a turn when Tyler asks him to punch him. From then on, they meet up
regularly, and well, just simply punch each others guts out. Soon, they
develop a following and when they group became too big to just hold a
slugfest in the open, they decide to take it underground. Thus FIGHT CLUB is
created. The first rule of fight club is : you dont tell anyone about FIGHT
CLUB, second rule of fight club is : you dont tell anyone about FIGHT CLUB,
third rule of fight club is : you dont tell anyone about FIGHT CLUB</P>
<P>FIGHT CLUB is simply so bizarre, its hard to believe that audience can
actually immerse so easily in it. Its pure fun. Brutal..but fun. Superb
acting from Norton (fresh from AMERICAN HISTORY X) and Pitt. Norton once
again demonstrates his acting versatility, from buff (AMERICAN HISTORY X) to
geek in FIGHT CLUB. Pitts neurotic Tyler really scared the shit out of me
but still, very adorable. Meat Loafs lactating bodybuilder role is
unforgettable. Fincher does it yet again, you just cant imagine another
director doing this movie any better.
FIGHT CLUB is fresh, funny and brutal. A definite must-see for all!</P>
