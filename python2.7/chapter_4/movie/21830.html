<PRE>[1.5/4.0]</PRE>
<P>The genre of romantic comedy often gets critical sneers, not because
it is inherently weak, but rather because it has mass appeal, and thus
films of this type often follow standard formulas in order to appeal
to the largest market possible. It is well understood that the
greatest number of viewers will be pleased by delivering a happy
ending. This film frustratingly follows all the elements of the
formula.</P>
<P>Oscar Novak (Matthew Perry) and his partner Peter Steinberg (Oliver
Platt) are capable who are looking for the big job that will establish
them. They are bidding for a renovation project for tycoon Charles
Newman (Dylan McDermott), but they are competing with a more
established firm. As a result, they feel they must do everything
possible to win the contract. Through a series of misinterpretations,
aided by the pairs' competitors, the gay Peter is presumed to be
straight and the straight Oscar is presumed to be gay.</P>
<P>The possessive Charles wants to find someone to keep tabs on his
artist mistress Amy Post (Neve Campbell), and Oscar appears to be just
the man for the job. Charles see no threat in having a gay man
associate with his mistress, and Oscar is willing to ascend to Charles
demands because he wants to win the contract. Oscar falls for Amy, and
she becomes attracted to him also, but Oscar cannot reveal his true
feeling without jeopardizing his and Peter's professional future.</P>
<P>The film has one clever dimension, and that is the concept of a
straight man pretending to be gay. In real life, it is the reverse
that usually happens. By allowing viewers to relate to a character who
is forced to pretend to be different from his nature, perhaps some
members of the audience will be more compassionate to the plight of
homosexuals who are forced to masquerade as heterosexuals.</P>
<P>Perry give an entertaining performance. Although most of Oscar's
one-liners are telegraphed, Perry is able to keep the character witty
and likable. Pratt gives an understated performance and thankfully
does not allow his character degenerate into a typically overwrought
stereotypical gay man. The remaining performances were not pleasant to
watch. Charles is not written as anything more than an unlikable
villain, and McDermott does not extend the character beyond that
single dimension. Campbell is particularly ineffective as Amy by
constantly making forced efforts to have the character appear cute and
quirky, and sacrificing any depth of personality.</P>
<P>One disingenuous aspect is the inexplicable relationship between
utterly likable Amy and the irredeemable Charles. Amy explains that it
is difficult for her to meet the right man and establish a
relationship, which is not an uncommon situation for many single
women. Still, it is not understandable how a young, highly attractive,
sociable, and energetic woman would not be able to establish a
relationship with any man in Chicago, except a lout. She does not even
take money or get security from Charles, so the only thing she appears
to derive from the relationship is companionship, which would not be
hard to find elsewhere.</P>
<P>The most disappointing aspect of the film is the utter lack of
originality in the plot. The narrative was designed to please the
maximum number of viewers. The ludicrous climax has all characters and
subplots merge and resolve themselves to the satisfaction of all
involved, which makes the whole narrative hollow. The film aspires to
no artistic goals, but will possibly appeal to the mass audience, and
there is no reason it will not be successful there.</P>
<P>Marginally recommended. The film achieves what it sets out to do, and
as a result it will likely have some amount of commercial success.
However, it is successful because it sets very low goals. It has one
core idea that is interesting, but that gets buried beneath may layers
of familiarity, predictability, and convenience.</P>
