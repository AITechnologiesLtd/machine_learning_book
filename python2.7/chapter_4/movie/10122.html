 ________________________________________________________________</P>
<P>  The central focus of Michael Winterbottom's "Welcome to Sarajevo" is
Sarajevo itself, the city under siege, and its different effect on the
characters unfortunate enough to be stuck there. It proves the backdrop for a
stunningly realized story which refreshingly strays from mythic portents (
"Platoon" ), racial tumultuosness ( the risible "The Walking Dead" ) or a
tinge of schmaltziness ( "Schindler's List" ). The two leads, Stephen Dillane
as a reporter and Emira Nusevic as an orphan with a plight few can identify
with, are extremely believable; not one moment with them involved rings false.</P>
<P> The question is not what went right. The question is what went wrong. For
one, the film fails to provide a political overview of the war as it
progresses ( the Dillane characters reports an American plane departing from
Sarajevo as it departs, and that's about it.). The assortment of high-profile
supporting actors, ranging from Woody Harrelson as a Yankee reporter "into"
liquor and cigarrettes to Marisa Tomei as a huggable children's aid or
somesuch are incapable of rising above the sketchiness of their characters,
albeit they strive.</P>
<P> The interrupted use of authentic war footage somewhat hampers the rest of the
film, it makes the fictional characters seem powerless by comparison.</P>
<P> Still, Winterbottom eschews mawkishness  through flashy, frantic editing and
imaginative use of music. And it's a plus, because he doesn't toy with our
emotions with sentimental blandness. He wants us to know that in war, no one
is victorious.</P>
<PRE> The Sweet Hereafter </PRE>
<PRE>  Rating: **** out of ****</PRE>
<P> Starring Ian Holm, Sarah Polley, Bruce Greenwood, Tom McCamus, Gabrielle
Rose, Arsinee Khanjian, Alberta Watson, Maury Chaykin, Caerthan Banks.
Produced by Atom Egoyan and Camelia Frieberg. Script by Atom Egoyan (Based on
the novel by Russell Banks). Directed by Atom Egoyan. Running Time: 110 mins.
Rated R.
 __________________________________________________________</P>
<P>   Atom Egoyan's powerfully meditative "The Sweet Hereafter" is as anything as
haunting and transcendental as I've seen this year.</P>
<P> It not only explores the aftermaths of a terrible tragedy with magnificent
subtlety , with cold,  and stunning shots of the backdrop of this mistfortune
but also by telegraphing the sense of devastation that has permeated the small
town with an enormous amount of dignity and respect for each and every soul
affected.</P>
<P> Ian Holm as the somber, lonely lawyer seeking compensation for the
townspeople, has a decency and a restraint uncommon with lawyers, he's a lion
for the wrong reasons: the pain for having lost his daughter ( she's a druggie
who frequently calls him begging for money  ) is reflected on the town. And in
some mesmerizing flashbacks, we witness how she lost her purity. It's one of
the most strikingly breathtaking takes on the loss of innocence I've ever
seen.</P>
<P> But the most astounding part goes to Sarah Polly, the peaceful, benevolent
girl who, in contrast to the other characters, remains the most mentally
stable during past, present or future. Her ability to convey concealed pain
and unconditional love is the opposite, yet near-revolutionary role that won
Emily Watson an Oscar nomination for "Breaking the Waves". Both women are torn
apart by an extraordinary incident but it is only then that we truly see,
truly feel, their wordless, omnipotent love. </P>
<P> "The Sweet Hereafter" though, is Atom Egoyan's movie and as of now, he is
emerging as the definite face of independent cinema. After surging to
worldwide recognition with 1994's "Exotica", "The Sweet Hereafter" makes him
something few people in this industry can call themselves: an artist. He
interweaves time with a delicacy and sees a soul with a purity that is just
not common.</P>
