Palmetto (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>a review by Christian Pyle</PRE>
<P>You know the plot:  a dimwit with a shady past is seduced into committing a
crime only to be double-crossed by a fatal femme.  In "Palmetto," the dimwit is
Harry Barber (Woody Harrelson), a reporter who's just been released from prison
(he was framed by the gangsters and corrupt officials he was investigating). 
Enter la femme:  Rhea Malroux (Elisabeth Shue), the sexy young wife of the
richest man in Palmetto, Florida (Rolf Hoppe).  She and her stepdaughter Odette
(Chloë Sevigny) have a plot to extort 500K from the old man:  Harry will
"kidnap" Odette.  After groping both women, Harry agrees.  As everyone except
Harry can see, he's being set up as a fall guy.  Sure enough, before long,
Harry has a dead body in his trunk and the cops on his tail.  His
brother-in-law (Tom Wright), an assistant DA, has hired Harry to be the press
liaison for the case, so Harry gets a front row seat for his own manhunt (and
we get to watch him sweat-literally).  There are several plot twists, of
course-a couple of them even took me by surprise.</P>
<P>Apparently every woman in Palmetto is a raving horndog, and they're on Harry
like he's the only bone in the kennel.  Shue vamps so broadly that I expected
Tex Avery's wolf to show up.  Her incredible performance in "Leaving Las Vegas"
seems to have been a fluke.  Here, she could easily be mistaken for Melanie
Griffith.  Shue's character is supposed to be a savvy schemer but she comes off
as a brainless bimbo.  In addition to Shue and Sevigny, the kennel includes
Gina Gershon (who filled the dimwit-with-a-shady-past role in "Bound") as
Harry's girlfriend Nina; when Harry gets out of jail, she licks his face (now
there's a horndog).  The parts are so overplayed that with a little push
"Palmetto" could have been an over-the-top parody of film noir a la "Romeo is
Bleeding."  As it is, it's best watched at  2am on Showtime (the love scenes
seem to have been written for one of that channel's soft porn programs anyway).</P>
<P>"Palmetto" has a well-known director, Volker Schlöndorff, who's best known for
his adaptations of major literary works, especially "The Tin Drum."  I suppose
he must have been drawn to this plot-by-numbers script by the same admiration
for classic film noir that led Scorsese to remake "Cape Fear."  Schlöndorff
tries hard-he makes an interesting motif out of the ubiquitous palmetto
bugs-but nothing can freshen up this stale script.</P>
