<P>    This silly, sloppy, psychedelic spy-movie spoof stars and was writ-
ten by Mike Myers, who plays both the title character and his arch-
nemesis, Dr. Evil.  Both have been reawakened from suspended animation,
to do battle in and begin adjusting to the nineties. (Powers has prob-
lems with political correctness, Baby, while Evil has to adjust his
megalomaniac musings to accommodate inflation, ozone depletion, and
Prince Charles' babe-o-matic ears.) The credits sequence is pretty
groovy, I'll give it that, but the rest of the movie contains no more
than, oh, twenty minutes of bankable hilarity.  The jokes are bad, the
timing worse, and only the occasional sequence stands out, such as Myers
walking around in the buff, with various objects in the frame concealing
his naughty bits.  (Okay, I'll admit it:  I also howled at a sequence
set in a public restroom, with Powers fending off an assassin's attack
and Tom Arnold in the next stall, thinking that he's hearing a struggle
of a different kind.) The character of Austin Powers is, for all pract-
ical purposes, another classic Mike Myers' creation, but damned if his
script has a clue what to do with him.</P>
