<PRE>Antz (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Mark O'Hara</PRE>
<P>>From the first scenes of the cavern where the ants carry on their busy 
lives, we see that Antz is a movie full of action and ideas.  Too 
cerebral for young children, it has a pace and a charm that will attract 
everyone else.  The film spends much of its 77 minutes looking at the 
worth of the individual and his place in society.  </P>
<P>One indicator of popular culture in Antz is the struggle of the 
individual.  Z, voiced by Woody Allen, plays the worker ant in analysis 
- just one item of Allen's schtick carried over into this, his first 
appearance in animation.  Despite his small stature and relative 
shyness, Z carries through with actions that demonstrate his beliefs.  
>From refusing to stomp mindlessly in a massive line dance, to leaving 
the colony at one point, Z proves himself the ultimate democratic 
insect.  Viewers surely enjoy rooting for the underdog, and Z serves 
well in the role of an inconsequential creature acquiring a voice.  The 
only trouble is that we have to keep our disbelief suspended throughout 
the non-stop anthropomorphism:  isn't it natural for ants to work as a 
collective, for the good of the colony?</P>
<P>Class is another theme explored in Antz.  Along with pulling for the 
weak, we also obsess over royalty - and this plot allows for a real 
queen (Anne Bancroft) and her daughter Princess Bala (Sharon Stone).  
The only plot better than the triumph of an underdog occurs when the 
underdog pursues the heart of a princess.  Z is irresistible when he 
schemes to meet Bala a second time, and stumbles into trouble with the 
princess' fiancé, the square-jawed Mandible (Gene Hackman) and his 
henchman.  Though outrageous, Z's plight is everyman's:  a peasant 
worker aspiring to a higher station - soldier - and what's worse, daring 
to dance with the daughter of the colony's birth-mother.  We love seeing 
it stuck to the powerful and arrogant.</P>
<P>Aside from the university, Hollywood is a staunch promoter of 
correctness.  In Antz, Dreamworks SKG has succeeded in portraying a 
rather pluralistic society;  according to this story, no one should be 
able to say, "All ants look the same."  (We can transfer this sentiment 
to a political context, and see that we are being taught gentle lessons 
in tolerance.)  In any case, directors Eric Darnell and Lawrence 
Guterman adopted techniques from conventional animation, and used much 
of the actor's personality and appearance in the cartoon image.  These 
representations are delightful, as in the case of Christopher Walken's 
long face to match the suave and menacing voice of Colonel Cutter.  
Sylvester Stallone delivers a smart self-parody as Weaver, a huge 
soldier ant with a smallish head but a thorax like a Vick's cough drop.  
So these ants really look nothing like each other, and the animation 
imitates the differences of real life - whether in body type or racial 
features or philosophical views.  Finally, we observe other species of 
insects, including a reunion of Jane Curtin and Dan Ackroyd, as a pair 
of snobby yellow jackets.</P>
<P>Layering conflict upon conflict, the film suggests that we like old and 
busy plots;  here old does not mean stale, as the movie wraps the plot 
in new paper.  Heavy-duty digitized animation is clearly another ware we 
pay our money for.  Antz is just as well-plotted and -animated as Toy 
Story but not as nice to look at.  Its duller earth-tones fit its 
serious themes, though, and the mood is lightened by humor and by 
occasional ventures outside the colony to a land known as "Insectopia."  </P>
<P>Antz mirrors our society in the way it promotes the value and dignity of 
each person.  In an increasingly technological world, viewers like to 
see positive portrayals of common people and of their roles.  Love 
stories and laughs don't hurt, either.</P>
