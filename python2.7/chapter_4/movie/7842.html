An MGM film. 101 min.</P>
<P>Mid-budget, undemanding MGM movie about young ladies who are sent West, ca
1870, to waitress in  a railroad restaurant of the huge Fred Harvey chain,
and who also help civilize the uncouth..Very slim stuff in every respect,
including the act-by-numbers performances.</P>
<P>There are pleasant bits here and there no doubt, but the movie lacks the
kind of unity and concentration that give such productions strength and
lift them from the episodic to a whole with character.</P>
<P>I can only guess that the main reason for this is the large number of
writers -- too many cooks spoiling the broth, screenplay by committee,  and
all that. In fact, the only writer's name that stands out is Samson
Raphaelson's, the playwright (some of whose stage works became movies,
notably the landmark "The Jazz Singer") and class A screenwriter who worked
much with the great Ernst Lubitsch and shared with him a sense of irony,
wit and naughtiness. I would bet that had Raphaelson been "The Harvey
Girls" sole scribe the movie would have gained significantly.</P>
<P>This musical's  best feature is the Oscar-winning  "On the Atchison, Topeka
and the Santa Fe"  by Johnny Mercer and Harry Warren, one of the classic
choo-choo songs. Its vigorous nature and imaginative staging make of it  an
interesting break with the typical numbers of earlier musicals, including
movies with Garland. It announces a new style, especially that of musical
"Westerns" like "Oklahoma !" or "Seven Brides For Seven Brothers ."</P>
<P>This number occurs very early in the picture. After that, it's downhill
most of the way, including  much feeble music, though some people  may like
"In the Valley When the Evening Sun Goes Down," sung by Judy Garland.</P>
<P>Note that Angela Lansbury's fine singing voice is her own (as it is in
other pictures) but Cyd Charisse's is dubbed.</P>
