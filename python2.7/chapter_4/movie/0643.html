                          A GIRL FROM HUNAN
                  A film review by Thomas E. Billings
                   Copyright 1989 Thomas E. Billings</PRE>
<P>Synopsis:
In pre-revolutionary China, a 12 year old girl is married to a 2 year old boy,
following the ancient tradition of child marriage.  Four years later the girl
is a young woman, experiencing her sexual awakening.  She has an affair and
gets pregnant.  This is very serious, for the penalty for adultery is death -
by drowning.  An interesting and surprisingly funny film.</P>
<P>China (English subtitles), color, 1986 (released in US: 1988), 110 minutes.
Directors: Xie Fei, U Lan</P>
<P>     Set in the recent past in pre-revolutionary China, this is the story of
Xiao Xiao, a young woman who is married, at age twelve, to a two year old boy.
This is the ancient tradition of (arranged) child marriage.  Both Xiao Xiao and
her husband are peasants, and live with her husband's family in a rural 
village, where they are farmers.  Xiao Xiao's husband, as he grows up, refers 
to her as "sister"!</P>
<P>     Four years later, she is maturing and awakening sexually.  Xiao Xiao's
mother-in-law is critical of her, for being lazy, and, even worse, for not
binding her feet and breasts (a common practice of the day).</P>
<P>     Shortly thereafter, Xiao Xiao is raped by a neighbor.  Rather than report
it, she takes the man as a lover, for it seems that she really likes sex.  Soon
she realizes that she is pregnant, and she starts gaining weight.</P>
<P>     The next day a couple in the village are caught in adultery.  As
punishment they injure the man and drown the woman.  This terrifies Xiao Xiao
and her lover.  Soon, her lover flees, leaving Xiao Xiao to face her fate
alone.  Is she drowned, the standard punishment for adulterous women?  What is
her fate?  See the film to find out.</P>
<P>     This is a very interesting film.  It illustrates some of the customs of
old China: arranged child marriages, infanticide of female infants, and the low
status of women (lower than cattle, it seems) in that society.  Although a bit
slow at times, it holds your interest very well.</P>
<P>     One surprising thing about this film is its humor.  I don't think any of
it is intended to be funny, but there are many times when you cannot help but
laugh.  For instance, at Xiao Xiao's wedding, her husband (being only 2 years
old) decides it's a great time to cry.  Later, Xiao Xiao's "uncle" (father-in-
law) reports seeing "girl students" on a trip to the city.  These people find
it funny and strange; what do women need education for?  Besides that, the
"girl students" are shameless, exposing their arms and part of their legs for
all to see!</P>
<P>     There is one quote from the film that neatly summarizes it.  At a critical
time, an older woman tells Xiao Xiao that "women are born to suffer."  This
film perfectly illustrates their suffering in old China.  It is interesting and
reasonably well made.  Overall, a very good film - definitely worth seeing.</P>
<P>Distribution.  No information available; suspect that you might find it
screened at repertory theaters and/or art houses.  Print Source: New Yorker
Films.</P>
