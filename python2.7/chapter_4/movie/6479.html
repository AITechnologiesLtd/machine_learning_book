<P>Sylvester Stallone has vowed that 'Daylight' will be the last big booming
action picture of his career.  Stallone made this decision while his
newborn daughter underwent emergency heart surgery earlier this year.  As
Sly approaches 50 this would be a good move and a chance for him to branch
out and search for the true acting ability he has despite what some
critics have said about him.  His roles in the original 'Rocky,' 'Paradise
Alley,' and 'Nighthawks' demonstrate that Stallone can do well at the
craft of acting.  'Daylight' takes place in New York City and one late
afternoon a horrifying accident takes place in the Lincoln tunnel which
connects New York and New Jersey underwater.  It was built around World
War I and is unstable in many places.  Hundreds are killed in the fiery
flash of action and the tunnel is sealed at both ends.  Stallone is a New
York City cab driver who arrives caught on the scene and offers his
services.  Unusual you say?  Perhaps, but Sly is a former EMS (Emergency
Medical Service) tactician who was fired by the city after a rescue under
his command killed several people.  Only a handful of survivors remain and
Stallone does his best to rescue them all.  This movie immediately put me
in mind of 'The Poseidon Adventure' (1972) in which a handful of survivors
tried to make it out from a luxury cruise liner which capsized.  Combine
that with stunts seen in other action/disaster films over the years and
you have the makings for a somewhat unoriginal but entertaining film with
graphic and stunningly realistic special effects courtesy of ILM. 
'Daylight' is from director Rob Cohen ('Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story') who
has woven an exciting action film together with somewhat shallow
characters but the scenes of rescue and survival are credible and this
film is a must for loyal Stallone fans while the rest of us are likely to
come out satisfied but will digest it quickly with our fast food treat we
like to get after the movie is out.  Other cast members are Amy Brenneman,
Viggo Mortensen, Dan Hedaya, Jay O. Sanders, Karen Young, Claire Bloom,
Barry Newman and Stan Shaw.</P>
