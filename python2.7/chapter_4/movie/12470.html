<P>Man of la Mancha -Review by Albert Moreno  (retrospective)
When the film version of Man of La Mancha was released in 1972,it was
greeted by howls of disapproval from pretentious critics who claimed
it was a distortion of Cervantes' "Don Quixote",which was supposedly a
satire on knight-errantry. Never mind the fact that literary critics
have found much more profound meanings in the book and that Broadway
critics praised the musical for being faithful to the spirit of
Cervantes'novel. Perhaps the critics were prejudiced by this,and by
the fact that United Artists had hired the original creative team of
the show and then fired them because they were unhappy with the screen
tests. Mostly non-singing actors were used in the film (Peter O'Toole 
was dubbed),and only one member of the original cast, Gino Conforti,as
the barber,repeats his stage role. In spite of the singing
limitations,the film is quite good-splendidly acted and photographed
(by Fellini cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno). Peter O' Toole, Sophia
Loren,James Coco ,as well as Shakespearean actors Harry Andrews, John
Castle and Ian Richardson bring real sensitivity to the spoken
dialogue,and some of the singing voices,such as Richardson's, Julie
Gregg's, James Coco's and the muleteer's chorus are actually quite
passable.  The sets are picturesquely shabby, as the original stage
set and costume designers wished. Those who fault the movie for not
being glamorous enough should read Don Quixote and check out the
locales of the story for themselves. I wonder if  any of them actually
read the book.
Man of La Mancha begins with a burst of bright color in the middle of
the town square in Seville,as a festival is taking place(an opening
completely different from the play.) Cervantes,playwright,poet,and
part-time tax collector, is arrested by the Spanish Inquisition for
putting on a satirical entertainment supposedly offensive to them. He
and his manservant are taken to a prison and thrown into an
underground dungeon (it is here that the original play begins).In
prison,they are attacked by their fellow inmates ,who stage a mock
trial with the purpose of confiscating Cervants'belongings. One of
these belongings is a manuscript,and in order to save it, Cervantes
pleads his defense-he ,the manservant,and their fellow prisoners will
improvise the story of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. The remainder of
the film alternates between the Don Quixote scenes and the prison
scenes. Cervantes transforms himself into his fictional counterpart
with makeup and costume, and we see the effect his fantastic but
moving story has upon his fellow prisoners.The transitions between the
prison and the locales of "Don Quixote" are very smoothly
done,although this was one of the sore points of the film.On stage,one
set was used for the entire play, and the audience filled in the rest
with their imagination. In the film,the real locales are quite
literally shown.
Still,none of this detracts from the enjoyment of the film,and those
who like a good cry should love this film. "Man of La Mancha" is of
course, far more sentimental than "Don Quixote",but one is surprised
at how much of the original style of Cervantes' dialogue is
retained,despite the fact that most of the plot is not found in the
novel,but wholly original to the play. Don't miss "Man of La Mancha".</P>
