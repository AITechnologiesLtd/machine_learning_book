BULWORTH</PRE>
<P>Starring Warren Beatty, Halle Berry and Oliver Platt</P>
<P>Written by Warren Beatty and Jeremy Pikser</P>
<PRE>Directed by Warren Beatty</PRE>
<P>Watching BULWORTH was an educational experience. I learned a new slang 
term: nappy dugout. If you don't know what a nappy dugout is, then 
I'm not going to tell you - I try to keep FILMGEEK a family site, 
more or less, and I sure don't want to be responsible for some 
6th-grader running around telling his friends what a nappy dugout is. 
But I hadn't heard it before, and I thought it was pretty funny. 
BULWORTH is full of such surprising moments - surprising because you 
don't necessarily expect this level of energy in a film written and 
directed by a sixty-something actor like Beatty. Check out the recent 
films of Beatty contemporaries Clint Eastwood and Paul Newman, and 
you'll see what I mean; you could show some of these pictures in the 
Geriatric ward and you wouldn't even roust the old folks from their 
checkers games. But BULWORTH moves. It's far from a perfect film, but 
it's sharp, witty and has something to say - three elements that most 
of the pictures released this year have been sorely lacking.</P>
<P>Here's the story. California Senator Jay Bulworth (Beatty) is at the 
end of his rope. A career politician, he finds himself in the middle of 
his latest re-election campaign without hope or moral compass. He's a 
slave to the big insurance companies who finance his campaigns. His 
liberal idealism has long since succumbed to the choking rhetoric of 
Washington which he is forced to spout ad nauseam to keep his place at 
the Federal feed trough. Even his marriage is a sham. Despondent, 
Bulworth makes one last, desperate attempt to break free: he takes out a 
contract on his own life. Beats going to work in the private sector, one 
supposes.</P>
<P>But then something odd happens. Bulworth finds his self-imposed death 
sentence strangely liberating. Fueled by delirium brought on by a lack 
of sleep, he spends his next few campaign stops saying exactly what's 
on his mind. To a congregation of black churchgoers: "If you don't put 
down the malt liquor and the chicken wings and get behind somebody other 
than a running back who stabs his wife, you'll never get rid of 
somebody like me." To a gathering of big-money Hollywood Jews: "Your 
pictures really aren't very good, are they?" And so it goes, until 
Bulworth has drawn the attention of the national media and sent his 
campaign manager Dennis (Oliver Platt) into a cocaine-induced panic. He 
picks up three young black women at the church, including Nina (Halle 
Berry), who seems to take a special interest in him. He parties with 
them at an underground nightclub, where he discovers rap music. The next 
day, he starts rapping his message instead of giving speeches. Suddenly 
he's a hip-hopping, straight-talking sensation, and life is fun again. 
But that pesky hit man is still out there somewhere.</P>
<P>BULWORTH's first act is nothing short of sensational. As actor, writer 
and director, Beatty is in full command; the dialogue is crisp and 
arresting, the story moves swiftly and the performances by Beatty, Berry 
and Platt are right on the money. Those of you who thought WAG THE DOG 
was a good satire should put it up against the first thirty minutes of 
this picture and admit the error of your ways. For a short time, it 
looks as if Beatty is really going to break through with an important 
film. It takes a lot of guts to use studio money to convey the awful 
truth about American politics: that because the same five or six 
multi-national corporations who funnel all the money into political 
campaigns control not only the means of production in this country, but 
also the media outlets which purport to give us an impartial 
dissemination of the facts, American democracy has become simply another 
mindless diversion designed to give us the illusion of freedom. Makes 
you proud to be alive, doesn't it?</P>
<P>Unfortunately, BULWORTH doesn't sustain the same level of brilliance 
throughout. The story literally gets sidetracked in Watts. On the lam 
from the hit man, Bulworth hides out with Nina in her family's home, 
where he gets a good dose of quality black family life. He befriends 
some grade-school drug dealers and confronts their supplier L.D., played 
by BOOGIE NIGHTS alumnus Don Cheadle. Suddenly it seems as if Beatty has 
wandered into another film entirely. By the time the press finds him and 
the political theme gets going again, it's too late; the picture's 
over, and we're left with some fuzzy notions about the inherent good 
of the inner city versus the unrepentant evil of big business. Yadda 
yadda yadda, we've all seen this before.</P>
<P>But for a while, at least, BULWORTH is daring and brilliant. I wish 
Beatty had honed in on his message, had hammered on it until audiences 
left the theater screaming for blood. Film has that power. It's true 
that if a politician who spoke the truth like Bulworth ever actually 
came along, he'd most likely be ignored. These are boom times, after 
all, and as long as there are SUVs to lease and mutual funds to dabble 
in, we're not likely to pay much attention to what goes on over our 
heads. But the good times won't last forever. HMO's, banks, media 
companies, even manufacturers are gobbling up one another in an orgy of 
unbridled capitalism. Every day we have a little less control over our 
lives than we did the day before. BULWORTH could have been a warning 
sign, a harbinger of doom or a prophetic look at the abyss of the 21st 
century. It settled for being just a decent little film which, while 
enjoyable, will ultimately have no impact. Oh well - at least I can 
amuse my friends at parties with my new vulgar slang terms.</P>
