                      A film review by Timothy Voon

<P>So here I am faced with the dilemma of reviewing another John Grisham
movie. I ask myself, shall I be fair or should I trash it? After all
this is number umpteen in a long line of successful Grisham movies, and
the one most likely to be torn apart by critics hungry for blood. Let's
be fair.</P>
<P>This is not by any means the most engrossing court room drama to date,
but it is certainly one of the more amusing attempts to lighten the
heavy weight of legal discourse. Thanks to Danny Devito and his funny
man antics we have achieved the latter to the end. Frances Ford Cappola
seems an unusual choice for directing such an unconventional mixture of
drama and comedy, and remarkably this movie isn't clouded by his usual
heavy directional undertones. When the movie finishes, you'll be
wandering to yourself  ‘My God, Frances Ford Cappola directed this ???'.</P>
<P>For better or worse, Coppola has decided to sway away from using a prime
grade star by choosing a relative unknown such as Matt Damon, to play
the lead. This I personally believe was a mistake. People are always
asking about who the male and female leads of a movie are, and when you
can only provide a …. Ummmmh….. in response to their question, you will
likely get an ….Ohhhh….. from them, before they brush the movie into
their memory – that's unless you are a die hard Grisham fan. Matt Damon
is every bit good quality for money as the young lawyer who makes a
miracle happen in court, but someone like Ethan Hawke may have been
better material.</P>
<P>There is however a strong cast of supporting actors and actresses. Jon
Voight is delightfully crooked as the powerful lawyer providing defence
for the fraudulent health insurance business. Devito I have already
mentioned, and other well knowns like Danny Glover, Roy Scheider and
Mickey Rourke throw in fine performances. The most unbelievable and
sadly miscast is Clare Danes in the role of a battered wife who also
provides a love interest for the young Matt Damon. Not only are the
bandages hanging off her face in the most pathetic manner, but the
flimsy method of application with a stuck band-aid here and there is
ludicrous. This is sadly the fault of a misinformed make-up artist with
no first aid experience.</P>
<P>Beside this, there is only one point of contention in this movie that I
have to mention. When the battered wife (Danes) asks the young lawyer
(Damon) for the baseball bat and then closes the door behind her before
beating her husband's brains out ……. sad to say this can no longer be
considered ‘The Battered Wife Syndrome' or ‘Manslaughter' – the correct
term would be intent to kill and cannot be justified by the fact the
abusive husband deserved to die. Once the husband is dead it is implied
that the lawyer and housewife get together. This surprised me
considering that all John Grisham movies carry such an undeniable sense
of right and wrong, but now such leeway is given. Besides this minor
quirk, the audience is drawn into caring about what happens to the
characters, and you will end up with another cathartic experience of
courtroom melodramatics to help soothe your society ill laden
conscience.</P>
