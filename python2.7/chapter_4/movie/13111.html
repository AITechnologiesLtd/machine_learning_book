<P>   Let's say you have a day off.  It's sunny and you go for a
walk when suddenly you come upon a line of gigantic vans
advertising "Golden Productions."  The traffic department has
the No Parking signs up. somce that a scene is being
filmed for a movie scheduled to open in seven months.  Do
you hang around?  Probably not.  Why not?  Because being
privy to something that sets the pulse racing is not going to
happen.  Instead you'll probably observe some production
guys just hanging around chewing the fat and then, maybe if
you're the type who stays on the phone whenever a customer
service tape says "Your call is very important to us; please
stay on the line," your tarrying will be rewarded with seven
minutes of action.</P>
<P>   Watching a shoot on location is among the most tiresome
activities in the world.  Wouldn't it be grand if you could
compress several weeks of filming into two hours and could
wander freely, invisible, about the set to see what really goes
on?  Thanks to a new documentary about the making of a
1996 movie, consider it done.  "Full Tilt Boogie" is a chronicle
of the filming of "From Dusk 'till Dawn," a campy vampire
thriller starring George Clooney, but it's not one of those
"talking heads" sagas like "Ayn Rand."  It's more in the nature
of, say, that intriguing stalk of Woody Allen in "Wild Man
Blues" or the rib-tickling satire by Michael Moore, "The Big
One."  We're given the full run of the set without suffering the
120 degree heat of Barstow, California; without putting in
eighteen hours days, only to applaud when the producers
give you nonunion wages and throw in a few months' health
insurance--which you don't need because you're young; but
you're also not going to have as much fun as the folks who
have "romances" every minute that they're not on the set or
chugging the endless beers in a karaoke bar.  </P>
<P>   Did someone say "fun"?  If you take what some of the crew
people say literally, you'd think they were out strictly for the
cash. When the gaffers, grips and assistant directors are
asked the key question, "Why are you in the film business?"
their answers are unanimously "to make money."  After just
twenty minutes of viewing time, though, you'll know they're
fibbing--just as sure as the essential aspect of films (as
Juliette Lewis tells us) is lying.  Contrary to what Dieter Busch
says tongue-in-cheek, "The production process is not
important to me," making a film is nonstop pleasure for the
production proles as well as the stars.</P>
<P>   "Full Tilt Boogie"--the title seems to mean "full steam
ahead"--is both a primer on filmmaking and a joyous ode to
the fun people can have when they work as a team in the
entertainment business.  Sarah Kelly, the doc's director, has
the merry job of interviewing the stars, their personal
assistants, gaffers, grips, electricians, union delegates, make-
up people, costumers, and designers.  She delights that her
exchanges will be featured not on the wearisome Sunday
morning TV broadcasts which no one watches (and which
those who do cannot take seriously); but will instead be seen
by film buffs, horror fans, Clooney groupies and the like who
deserve this insight into the jobs of the lucky people who
concocted "From Dusk 'till Dawn."  To no one's surprise the
heavy-hitters--George Clooney, who starred in "From Dusk 'till
Dawn" and Quentin Tarantino who wrote it--get a
disproportionate amount of time to cavort.  Clooney, who
parlayed his success in the TV series "E.R." to become the
man with the most screen presence in the business today,
flirts with every female in sight, indicating that
he gets as much "romance" as one of the film crew reports. 
Flexing his ample muscles and mugging for the camera, Mr.
Clooney is well aware of his charisma with the crew as with
his large audience.  By contrast Quentin Tarantino,
whose writing ushered in a new vogue for violence-as-fun,
appears nervous, puffing on a big cigar as if admitting he
lacks George Clooney's charm but is conscious of his
celebrity status with a substantial coterie of fans.  Richard
Rodriguez, who directed "From Dusk 'till Dawn" after gaining
a name for himself with the no-budget "El Mariachi" and
"Desperado," parades around the large set with a guitar
strapped about his neck, fully prepared to lead the
sizable crew in song whenever they feel the urge to vocalize--
which is often.  As though to break up the tension--which is
nonexistent save for the usual gripes about the food, the heat,
and the impossibly long hours--the team set up impish
competitions, the most acclaimed being for "Best Butt" on the
set.  The rump delegates vote from an abundance of choices
of Polaroids tacked to the wall, with Juliette Lewis most
outspoken about her selection.</P>
<P>>From time to time you'll feel that the squad are aware that the
camera is trained on them and that they are expected to act
with joyful abandon, but if other documentary subjects like
Woody Allen ("Wild Man Blues") are correct, chances are they
have forgotten that their activities are being recorded and are
simply enjoying themselves like entertainment people
everywhere.  Even Harvey Keitel, the only
performer who allegedly shunned the documentary, turns in a
number which at first resembles a sadly philosophic discourse
until we remember that he is simply staying in character as
the preacher.</P>
<P>To appreciate the documentary, it helps to have seen "From
Dusk 'till Dawn," just as viewers of "The X Files" would do
well to have watched the TV series for five years in
preparation for that film.  But director Sarah Kelly throws in
enough segments from Mr. Rodriguez's 1996 work to
familiarize the unlucky few who passed it by and who will get
yet another chance to take in its campy horror when the
inevitable sequel hits the screens.</P>
