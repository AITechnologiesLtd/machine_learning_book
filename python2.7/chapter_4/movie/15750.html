SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ****</PRE>
<P>Philip Henslowe is a small businessman with a cash flow problem in
SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE.  Philip, played by Geoffrey Rush in his best role
since SHINE, is the owner of a playhouse called "The Rose," where young
playwright William Shakespeare is supposed to put on his next play.</P>
<P>Philip's creditor, Fennyman (Tom Wilkinson), is pressuring him to repay
his debts forthwith.  This is no problem since Will's next play, "Romeo
and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter," is in development.  Actually, it
hasn't even begun since Will, played charmingly by Joseph Fiennes, has a
severe case of writer's block.</P>
<P>The movie delightfully mixes the romance and fighting of the play with
some equally high-spirited antics off stage.  The dialog from the play
works its way into the scenes outside of the theater.  When Philip
confronts Will about the need to finish the play in short order, Will
starts speaking poetically.  "No, we haven't the time, talk prose,"
Philip says, interrupting him.</P>
<P>As directed by John Madden (HER MAJESTY, MRS. BROWN) and written by Tom
Stoppard (ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD) and Marc Norman, the
movie bursts with comedic and romantic joy.  It is the small details
that separate great films from lesser ones, and it is here that
SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE proves its mettle.</P>
<P>When Will writes, the ink gets all over his fingernails.  He develops
writer's cramps from composing such a large volume of words so quickly.
We even watch him sharpening his quill pens.</P>
<P>The hilarious auditions and rehearsals are both insightful and humorous.
The acting talent from which Will has to choose is not all top drawer.
Philip, for example, insists that his stuttering tailor receive the key
part of the narrator since Philip is so heavily in debt to him.</P>
<P>In a perfect bit of casting, Gwyneth Paltrow, in clearly the best
performance of her career, plays Viola, a rich but untitled young woman.
Her father has arranged for her in three weeks time to marry the noble
but less wealthy Lord Wessex (Colin Firth).  Her father will obtain
royal connections, and Lord Wessex will be rewarded financially.  The
newlyweds are to live across the vast ocean in far-away Virginia.</P>
<P>Viola, a stunning beauty, seeks true love and poetry for her life.
After she falls for Will, she dresses as a boy and wins the part of
Romeo in the play.  (Women at the time were strictly forbidden to be
actors, and men in drag played the women's parts.)</P>
<P>Will falls head over heels in love with Viola and doesn't realize at
first that the young boy with the small goatee is his love.  This causes
one of the sweetest scenes of all when Viola, as a boy, is overcome with
sexual desire and plants a huge kiss one night on a stunned Will.</P>
<P>In the film's long romantic middle section, which nicely mirrors the
middle of the play they are rehearsing, Viola and Will are so much in
love that they have trouble keeping their hands and lips off of each
other.  These sensuous sequences make the picture one of the best date
movies of the year.</P>
<P>The film has as many subplots as a Shakespearean play but manages to
develop them well and still stay within the time limitations of a
traditional length motion picture.  Rupert Everett plays Will's
competition, Christopher Marlowe, whom Will sometimes claims to be in
order to trick people.  Judi Dench (Oscar nominee for HER MAJESTY, MRS.
BROWN) plays a different queen this time, Elizabeth I.</P>
<P>The best small part is that played by CHASING AMY's Ben Affleck, as a
cocky actor named Ned Alleyn.  Will cons Ned into thinking that his part
of Mercutio is the lead and the title of the play.  Eventually, Ned
finds out the truth, and it is he who suggests the better name of "Romeo
and Juliet" for it.</P>
<P>The movie ends with the production of the play and some last minute role
changes.  The movie uses the words of the play to suggest meanings for
the actors on and off stage.</P>
<P>"O, I am fortune's fool!" Will says aptly.  And Viola asks the question
that must be utmost on her mind, "O think'st thou we shall ever meet
again?"</P>
<P>The script will sweep you away.  One minute you are falling in love, the
next you are doubled over in laughter and the next finds you fascinated
by the minutia of the stagecraft.  The movie is for lovers, for
students, for budding actors, for connoisseurs of fine comedy, and for
just about everyone.</P>
<P>SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE runs 1:53.  It is rated R for sex and nudity and
would be fine for teenagers.</P>
