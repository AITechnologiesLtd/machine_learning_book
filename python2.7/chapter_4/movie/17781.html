Never Been Kissed (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Mark O'Hara</PRE>

<P>Raja Gosnell's 'Never Been Kissed' is a slick and likable film, a 
formulaic but ultimately satisfying romance targeted toward you, if 
you are part of the 18-34 demographic that causes Hollywood directors 
to look over their shoulders at every gag and angle.</P>
<P>Executive producer Drew Barrymore is so hard to dislike:  she has a 
talent for seeming genuine, ingenuous, sweet, amicable.  This vehicle 
has her portraying Josie Geller, a 25 year-old, brilliant young editor 
at the Sun-Times, a Northwestern graduate who has never gotten around 
to having a personal life.  A whim of her crusty boss gives her the 
chance at being a reporter - long an ambition of Josie's.  Better yet, 
she'll be an undercover reporter at a high school, enrolling as a 17 
year-old!  Her  brother, Rob Geller (David Arquette) isn't so sure 
this ruse will work, but Josie nevertheless drives up to the school in 
Rob's gauche Vega.  Will Josie be popular enough to penetrate the 
cliques-that-be?  The answer, which we discover as Josie in her white 
jeans sashays into Spanish class:  NO!</P>
<P>Josie, as it turns out, still suffers from terminal over-compensation. 
 She is so preoccupied with pleasing others, that she stumbles 
clumsily through the halls and life, even once walking into an opening 
door.  Rob, as it turns out, saves her act by re-enrolling also.  He 
has faked his ID, and wishes to reactivate his chances at a minor 
league baseball contract.  Smoothly Rob reverses the opinions of the 
superficial student population:  he lies continually until Josie has a 
sterling, awesome reputation.  Now she is liked not only by the 
"Denominators" - a nerdy math group led by a girl named Aldys (Leelee 
Sobieski) - but by the cool crowd as well.  </P>
<P>Alas, her major problem persists:  even as she masquerades as a part 
of the teen crowd that rejected her the first time through high 
school, Josie Geller is scooped by reporters from other papers.  She 
simply cannot uncover the right story, the juicy scandal that would 
invite the notoriety for which Mr. Rigfort (Garry Marshall) has sent 
her.</P>
<P>The film is expert at recreating "Josie Grossie's" zit-covered high 
school years.  Barrymore navigates her innocent way into gross 
injustice.  Even before the prom she is set up, Carrie-like, to take a 
humiliating dive.  In flashbacks disturbing in their reality, we watch 
the insensitivity of youngsters.  Later on, of course, there is too 
much moralizing about this selfishness;  but Barrymore pulls off the 
preachiness without being too pouty.</P>
<P>David Arquette acts well as Rob, his manner properly crazy and 
supportive.  In posing as a teen, he has a bit more trouble than 
Barrymore, though:  too mature and mannish.</P>
<P>Garry Marshall?  This guy is the original Brooklyn smoothie:  he does 
it all (with canny knowledge of how to make his own directing efforts 
succeed), and acts with abandon in a role replicated from his 
performance as network chief in 'Murphy Brown.'  Good at creating a 
living caricature, this guy is.</P>
<P>Michael Vartan as English teacher Sam Coulson is accomplished at 
playing through in the game of overcoming stereotypes:  he's the 
caring and supportive teacher, young and good-looking and himself 
artistic yet athletic.  A he-man with a momma's-boy 'do.  What amounts 
to the film's key plot element as well as its horrendous artifice is 
the relationship between Sam and Josie.  Apparently the audience is 
not supposed to be bothered when Sam longs for Josie, her precocious 
knowledge enthralling him.  What's worse, Rigfort and  another of 
Josie's bosses, (funny guy John C. Reilly, miscast here) try forcing 
Josie's hand into an ethically messy situation involving Sam.  And we 
are not supposed to dislike them for this scheme?</P>
<P>Molly Shannon supplies great support as Josie's newsroom friend Anita. 
 Her role also demands several nods to stereotypes, namely promiscuous 
ones.  But Shannon shows that her comic muscles are in shape in scene 
after scene.</P>
<P>As an aside, what causes screenwriters to fall for silly or obscurely 
allegorical names?  Who out there knows the meaning of the name of 
Josie's vacuous office assistant???</P>
<P>'Never Been Kissed' ranks above average in the surplus of teen films 
hitting the market.  Its strength is sincere acting, its weakness a 
cloying predictability.  It's obvious the film is  aware of its own 
need to meet the formula that will satisfy an audience.  The paradox 
here is that the ending makes us wait, and then indeed IS satisfying.</P>
