<P>With storytelling this compelling, who needs books? </P>
<P>Based on the book by author James Ellroy, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL is probably one
of the best piece of work produced by Hollywood in recent years.  Together
with director Curtis Hanson (The Hand That Rocks The Cradle, The River
Wild) whom Ellroy corroborated closely throughout the shooting of the film,
resulted in a movie with a plot and and script so tight, an atom would have
to squeeze itself through.</P>
<P>Set in the 50s, the story revolves around 3 policemen of vivid
personalities. Jack Vincennes (Spacey) is the cop who is more concerned on
busting with fame and stardom ala Hollywood style, concentrating heavily on
work which will attract him media attention. There is also the young
hot-shot rookie, Ed Exley (Pearce), fresh out of the academy and all-out to
carve a name for himself in the footsteps of his legendary cop father. The
tough and unnerving Bud White (Crowe), a cop who believes in justice, the
swift and violent way. 3 policemen, distinct in their characters and paths
but all of them working in a place where there is no real distinction
between good and evil. </P>
<P>When his partner is murdered on the day of his resignation, Bud sets out to
find the people responsible but unwittingly delved himself into something
more than just a simple robbery murder. Even after Exley receives a
promotion for his work on the murder case, happenings began to link itself
to the murder. The 3 eventually reach a point of convergence when what
actually began as a personal investigation turns out to be an uncovering of
a complex web of organised-crime in Hollywood.</P>
<P>The last time I remember a film so clever and compelling was when I watched
THE USUAL SUSPECTS. In L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, you do not get the shock and
cleverness as the former but it has a lot more of `story' going for it.
There is not a single moment in the film in which I felt was slow at all.
Surprisingly, though Spacey did a very convincing job as the street-wise
Vincennes, the movie was carried mostly by the two rather `unknowns',
Pearce and Crowe. Pearce's Exley is cool and calculative in his actions and
there is a slight hint of Val Kilmer in his appearance. Crowe's Bud White
is the most impressive of all; head-strong and temperamental, he should
obtain some sort of recognition for his work here. </P>
<P>Superb acting., wonderful storytelling and one of the best climaxing
gunfights ever. Easily the best Hollywood piece for 1997. </P>
