<PRE>The Green Mile (1999)

<P>Just when I thought Hollywood was on a slide down into mediocrity, I see a 
great film like The Green Mile that proves that there are still good movies 
that come out of Hollywood.  Lately, it seems that the good movies are the 
ones that come from independent studios, but The Green Mile shows that a 
big budget movie out of the stables of Hollywood can still be a gripping 
movie and grab a viewers emotions and drain them.</P>
<P>The Green Mile is like a follow-up to writer/director Frank Darabont's 
"Shawshank Redemption".  Both movies take place in about the same time and 
both movies take place in a prison.  The Green Mile is a milder movie and 
has only one little flaw that can be overlooked if one tries hard enough.</P>
<P>The Green Mile is a prison ward that has a floor that is a light lime 
color.  In this ward is held men who are on their last mile, they are on 
death row.  The head guard on The Green Mile is Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) 
and his belief is that these prisoners should be talked to and not stressed 
during their last mile of life.  One day the biggest prisoner enters The 
Green Mile; his name is John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan).  As it turns 
out Coffey is in prison for the murder and rape of two young girls, but as 
we find out he's just a gentle giant.  Did Coffey commit the murders?  We 
all can guess that plot point.</P>
<P>Coffey though, has a special gift and it is here that we have the little 
flaw that I mentioned before.  Apparently, Coffey can take away disease 
with a touch and spit it out in a cloud of computer-generated flies.  And 
the first time we are introduced to this is long into the movie, probably 
halfway or so (and this is a three-hour movie).  With this much time 
invested in a wholesome movie that doesn't need any suspension of 
disbelief, all the sudden we as the audience are forced to change mindsets 
when that cloud of computer-generated flies comes out of Coffey's 
mouth.  It's jarring.  It doesn't by any means ruin the film, but it is 
jarring.</P>
<P>Both Shawshank and The Green Mile are scripts adapted by Darabont from 
Stephen King stories.  I would say that Shawshank is the better movie, but 
The Green Mile is not far behind.  With Shawshank it is a straight film 
about real people.  With The Green Mile it's a film with some need to 
suspend belief because of Coffey's supernatural gift.</P>
<P>I must say the cast of The Green Mile is excellent.  All of the actors do a 
wonderful job.  Hanks and Duncan give standout performances.  Both were 
convincing and were perfect for their characters.  I have to give big kudos 
to Duncan who has been doing better and better roles.  I first saw him in 
Armageddon, then in The Whole Nine Yards, and now his best role yet in The 
Green Mile.  Among the other cast members that give great performances are 
Bonnie Hunt as Edgecomb's wife; David Morse, Doug Hutchison and Barry 
Pepper as fellow guards; and Michael Jeter as Del an inmate in ward.</P>
<P>The script by Darabont and Darabont's direction of the film are near 
perfect.  And this film is one of the best films of 1999.  I'm sad that I 
kept procrastinating and finally missed see The Green Mile in the theatres 
and ended up seeing it on DVD.  If you were like me and missed The Green 
Mile in the theatres, don't hesitate, go rent the video or DVD right 
away.  Don't Miss The Green Mile.</P>
