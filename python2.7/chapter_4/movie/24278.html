<P>Never been to Baltimore. What I know about it comes from a sampling 
of TV's "Homicide: Life on the Street" (Barry Levinson was one of the 
executive producers as well as the director of some episodes), and 
mainly from Levinson's movies "Diner," "Tin Men," "Avalon" and now 
"Liberty Heights." But the shot of Baltimore that has stayed with me 
was in Hitchcock's "Marnie." When the kleptomaniac woman visits her 
mother, we get a sight of ships at the end of the street, a barefaced 
phony image (rear projection or whatever) of the kind the Master 
sometimes used to thumb his nose at us.</P>
<P>There are no such reality-defying tricks in "Liberty Heights," where 
Levinson blends both memories and imagination. Nor is the film a 
piece of nostalgia. If anything, it is a effort, and a most 
successful one at that, to evoke a certain time (1945-46), its 
Baltimore Jews, Gentiles and Blacks, anti-Semitism, racism , ethnic 
and class distinctions , and slowly changing attitudes. It's a big 
order, yet the movie may seem deceptively simple.</P>
<P>The film goes in several directions, all integrated  somewhat in the 
manner of a  "bildungsroman," a novel about growth. What does the 
trick is not only Levinson's talent but his strong familiarity with 
the subjects, his big-hearted approach and, within his seriousness, a 
sense of humor. He forsakes both broad comedy and mushiness.</P>
<P>The story centers on a middle-class family in a mostly Jewish suburb. 
Mom is sweet and traditional. Dad owns a burlesque house that by then 
was a vanishing institution. He supplements his income with the 
numbers racket. Younger son Ben is in high school, older son Van in 
college. There are major changes in the nation. TV is making its 
mark. Rock'n roll is in. More importantly, schools have just been 
desegregated.</P>
<P>In Ben's class there is now Sylvia, a charming black girl who must be 
the first Negro (in the parlance of the times) that Ben has ever 
noticed in an era when this big minority was of invisible men and 
women. Ben may have seen Claude Rains in a rerun of "The Invisible 
Man" movie, but he certainly had not read Ralph Ellison's "Invisible 
Man" of 1952. He immediately feels drawn to Sylvia. And he tells his 
mother that he finds her attractive. Mom's reaction "Kill me now!" is 
funny, pathetic and full of meaning.</P>
<P>The two youngsters make friends. The daughter of a wealthy surgeon, 
Sylvia  lives in a beautiful home. She borrows her mother's car to 
drive Ben around, but he must crouch down. Interesting how he has to 
become temporarily an invisible man.</P>
<P>The relationship betwen the two is chaste. In her room Sylvia 
initiates Ben to recordings of black performers. It's a revelation. 
But this comes to an end when her father the doctor catches them. 
Forcefully but calmly he makes plain that his child is not allowed to 
frequent white boys. The sequence is a small gem of acting, 
reactions,  revealing black attitudes, and turning the tables on 
whites.</P>
<P>(Later, there is another revelation for Ben, when, with one of his 
best buddies, he goes to most skillfully reconstructed rock 'n roll 
concert by James Brown. The boys are the only whites in the crowd, 
and they become just as delirious as the public).</P>
<P>In the meantime, when senior brother Van and pals go to an 
all-Gentile Halloween party, they run into anti-Semitism that 
culminates in pugilism. Van also runs into  blonde, high society 
goddess Dubbie. He is smitten as never before.</P>
<P>Levinson has directed his young men with acute realism and a reining 
in of theatrics. The brothers have very strong feelings but keep them 
well-controlled. It is even more notable in the case of Van. Actor 
Adrien Brody bears a strong resemblance to the late French actor 
Charles Denner ("Z," "The Two of Us, "'Landru," "The Man Who Loved 
Women"). Both performers are good at pent-up emotions, but Brody 
never explodes.</P>
<P>The film is one of taboos that were just beginning to go away -- and 
have not yet entirely vanished. It reminds one of the days of Civil 
Rights struggles and may make you feel sad that the then-alliance of 
blacks and Jews later came to an end. But that's a subtext of the 
movie. Its open text, while true to life, is steadily respectful of 
minorities. The Jews, for example, never refer to the blacks as 
"schwartze."  They don't badmouth them, even when the plot adds its 
third element, beyond the Ben-Sylvia and Van -Dubbie twosomes.</P>
<P>That element is the boys' father, Nate, a man who apparently buys a 
new Cadillac every Jewish New Year. Circumstances I will not describe 
lead him to a heavy, ruinous debt toward Little Melvin, a black 
hustler, subsequently to an odd partnership and later yet to some 
thrills. As Nate, Italian-American Joe Mantegna would, on paper, make 
an unlikely Jew, but it is not the case. Casting him may well be a 
sly political way towards integrating ethnicities.</P>
<P>"Liberty Heights" depicts it locales, times and segments of society 
with first-class cinematography, sets, costumes, atmosphere, period 
music and the rest.  If there are any anachronisms, they are minor. 
Its touch is light but not superficial. Its people, young and older, 
speak and act in genuine 50s  fashion. The tempo is a good balance 
between fast and leisurely sections. And the film's length is 
justified by an abundance of  very good touches.
