<PRE>Tricky Richard
Dick</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>No, it's not about that! A generation ago (or so), old guys named Richard
used to like to be called Dick -- as a nickname see.</P>
<P>Set in 1972, two dippy fifteen year old girls stumble into the oval office
and are made official presidential dog walkers and later ... "Secret Youth
Advisers" to the president. Misunderstandings across their generation gap
with Nixon seemly dictate Tricky Dick's fate. If you're too young to
remember -- he's the president that got canned.</P>
<P>All of this occurs in a Forest Gumpy kind of way. But the girls, though
amusing, aren't as lovable as Tom Hanks in the aforementioned role. Nor is
their plight as endearing, making "Dick" -- Gump-lite.</P>
<P>I didn't start laughing until I saw Kissinger, however from there after I
enjoyed myself. Perhaps better appreciated by the over forty crowd, "Dick"
will make an excellent renter.</P>
<P>Of considerable muse: Nixon taking leave of office to Carly Simon's "You're
So Vain." His helicopter riding off to those lyrics is eerily apropos.</P>
<P>Starring Kirston Dunst and Dan Helaya.
Screenplay by Andrew Fleming and Sharyl Longin.
Directed by Andrew Fleming. Produced by Gale Anne Hurd at Columbia.</P>
<P>Grade..........................B+</P>
