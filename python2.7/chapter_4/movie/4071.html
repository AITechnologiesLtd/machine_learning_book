<PRE>                      THE YEAR OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY
                       A film review by Ralf Benner

<P>     Scene after dark scene after darker, more humid scene--bring along
your wiper-included night vision specs--you admire the fevered touches
Peter Weir brings to his vision of Third World hell in THE YEAR OF
LIVING DANGEROUSLY.  Based on C. J. Koch's award-winning novel about an
Australian journalist's reckless pursuit for that next front page scoop
during the attempted 1965 Communist coup of the Sukarno dictatorship in
Indonesia, the movie, filmed in the Philippines and budgeted at around
6 mil, summons up the atmosphere almost too well--you can get mighty
depressed as you view the expanses of privation, the polluted waters,
the westernized whores waiting for the foreign press at a local
cemetery, the random brutalities of insurgency and martial law.  The
only other "geopolitical" movies I can think of (at the moment) that
have this kind of horror-as-beauty impact to the eye are Roland Joffe's
THE KILLING FIELDS and, closer to home, Roger Spottiswoode's UNDER
FIRE, in which Oaxaca and Chiapas (later to cause Federales much
trouble) are set-decorated to be Nicaragua during Somoza's reign.
These latter two pictures got caught in the cross-fire of current
politics and propaganda, with governments and journalists at war with
the movie makers for what they believed were distortions, inaccuracies,
out and out lies. (I wondered at the time: What pot is calling what
kettle more black?)</P>
<P>     Weir doesn't have an explicit agenda; in fact, he intentionally
avoids the aftermath of the aborted Communist coup: starting on
September 30, 1965, the ensuing blood bath took the lives of between
300,000 and 400,000 Indonesians.  But what Weir does is brave enough:
he injects the failed revolution into his romantic inferno of sex and
competitive journalism (for which Saigon is the top drawer
assignment).  Taking the safe position of being against hunger and
abject poverty, the director puts a naive Australian reporter named Guy
Hamilton (Mel Gibson) at the center of a moral and ethical dilemma.
Shortly before the Communist take-over, Hamilton is given by dishy
bedmate-British attache Jill (Sigourney Weaver) a secret news flash --
that a shipload of arms for the commies is headed to the country.  If
Hamilton reveals the info, he would not only be endangering Jill's
life, and his own, but also the lives of Billy Kwan, the part-Chinese,
part-Australian dwarf photographer most responsible for his limited
successful filings, and all the remaining foreign nationals.  At the
same time, his energetic quest to be a high priest of journalism
necessitates that he get independent verification of the still-secret
news, as well as to continue to file peripheral stories; while the
other journalists are content to keep low during the bloody turbulence
by boozing, eating and whoring, he carries on his duties with foolhardy
abandon.  Unlike UNDER FIRE, in which journalists commit the gravest
sin by becoming involved and taking sides, and unlike THE KILLING
FIELDS wherein N.Y.Times reporter Sydney Schanberg suffers a case of
the guilts over leaving his beloved Cambodian buddy behind, THE YEAR OF
LIVING DANGEROUSLY confirms the dangers of the naive who compromise
professionalism and risk lives for newsprint glory.</P>
<P>     When THE YEAR OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY was released in 1983, and
Linda Hunt, who plays the male Billy, won a handful of awards,
including the Oscar, some of us were not unfair, but, well, reserved
about the performance.  Partially because we were at the point of
overdose with one sex playing another--as in TOOTSIE, YENTL, and
VICTOR/VICTORIA (and, to a degree, THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP).  Those
reversals deliberate and comic and, generally, quite satisfactory.  In
Hunt's case, there isn't any intended capriccio; this is serious
acting, and Hunt got the part not only because she had unique physical
qualifications, but also because there really wasn't any other male
actor available who had the voice for the needed authoritative
elocution.  Fighting Hunt's performance back then, it seemed to be that
Guy and Jill and Billy had a three-way relationship that we couldn't
get a fix on.  The crux of the bond they shared was never really
stated; they knew "something" we didn't.  Today, I'm still not sure
what they knew, or what Guy and Jill really felt beyond disguised
bourgeois pity.  But now, minus all the publicity that surrounded her
then, Hunt's portrayal seems far more than a director's gamble or
desperate last choice.  Though there's a slight betrayal to her sex
when we hear her reading the wording of an invitation to a swanky
affair, Hunt's Billy is a complex hero as sexual eunuch; with
cauliflower ears and a bad hair cut that accentuate the Asian, Billy
has a face that looks like Gale Sondergaard crossed with Leonard
Nimoy.  Ever the uninvited yet omnipresent photographer (of gloomy,
doomed humanity), who befriends Guy, and who provides Guy entree to the
political factions of Indonesia, Billy is also a secret writer of
dossiers, keeping files on his "finds."  Having a penchant for things
Russian, Billy drops a tidbit about Tolstoy while attacking Stalin for
having "good discipline--he wiped out ten million." (That's an
underestimate by half.) And Billy is the real writer amongst the
foreign journalists--his eyes "see" the real Djakarta, the famished
Indonesia, and is the only one to recognize Sukarno as the "great
puppet master of the right and left."  Dressed in print shirts with
large pockets filled with film stock to downplay the breasts, Hunt is
never ludicrous--not even when dancing with Sigourney Weaver to
"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On."  And the soundtrack's classics, which
accompany Billy, are incongruous-to-the-setting perfect: "September"
from Strauss's "Four Last Songs," performed by Kirite Kanawa, and
excerpts of "L'Enfant" from "Opera Sauvage."</P>
<P>     Watching Hunt in a role of a lifetime, you know that she earns the
right to steal the picture.  But she doesn't, or more precisely, she
can't.  No one could--not when you're co-starring with two super sexy
numbers like Sigourney Weaver and Mel Gibson, both of whom give great
heat.  With a youthful, almost petulant handsomeness, in a high
school-conservative do, wearing skinny, limply knotted ties and L.A.
beach shades and carrying a microphone in one hand and a recorder
hanging over a shoulder, Gibson's the spitting image of our worst fears
about journalists--a thoughtless Gung Dan.  But there's no denying the
power of his looks: his beauty at once disarms our defenses and at the
same time loads our fantasies which, I have no doubt, manifest into
nocturnal emissions.  Back in '83, when I first saw the movie, I told
friends who hadn't seen THE YEAR OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY yet, or the
previous year's ROAD WARRIOR that he'd become the hottest piece on the
international movie-beef rack.  I even wrote in notes that he'll leave
"women with soaked panties."  No one believed me--then.  When Weaver
first meets him at pool side, she lowers her sunglasses to get a better
view of him in a swim suit; when Hunt asks her opinion, Weaver says,
"Cheeky."  Stopping by Gibson's office, she checks him out once
again--giving him a below-the-belt glance that doesn't go unnoticed.
On what is their initial though informal date, Gibson and Weaver share
as a first drink something red-colored, during which he's being
boyishly insolent.  Suddenly thunder is heard and the rains pour down
and the camera moves on their overwhelmingly healthy faces that crack
into mile-wide smiles.  Jumping into a car to protect themselves from
the rain, holding glasses that are filled with a green concoction,
immersed in contagious laughter, the heat between them--and for
us--begins to rise.  We have to wait a bit for their first kiss--a nod
to the pent-up, erotic sneakiness of Liz & Monty in A PLACE IN THE
SUN.  Defying curfews and roadblocks, they speed past a blaze of
automatic weapon fire, so gloriously giddy with passion that they can
hardly keep their hands off one another.  After spending the night
together at Hunt's place, all of diplomatic Djakarta knows they've
consummated the affair and one envious journalist cracks to Gibson,
"You're looking a little pooped, kid." Exactly how we'd all like to be
feeling.</P>
<P>     Their sexiness notwithstanding, Weaver and Gibson are at least
quite adequate.  Let's say they get the job done, despite Weaver's poor
British accent--sounding as if it's a trial run for a vocal coach to
measure its deficiencies--and despite Gibson's runty movement (and
gleamy sweats suggesting a trick-as-trophy).  Weaver's like-no-tomorrow
chin matches her on-screen bulk--in some scenes her face and body have
an Amazonian hugeness--and at times she looks as if she could easily
squash little Mel.  She looks decidedly thinner when she's in a red
dress dancing, and only occasionally does it appear she's wearing
makeup. (In lobby cards, ads and the front cover of the video, she
looks quite cosmeticized--as if she had been done up by that expert
wizard, the late Way Bandy.) In some hairdos hinting at Mary Tyler
Moore, Weaver's Plane Jane is one of those vagabond career types who
has learned to put class in slumminess.  And learned to parlay
criticism into something constructive: when Gibson's Hamilton smarts at
her comment that one of his stories could have been better without the
"melodrama," he returns to the tape of it and realizes she's on to
something: it does sound like Tennessee Williams on a sap-sucking
downer.</P>
<P>     Better Australian movies there are--Fred Schepisi's CHANT OF
JUMMIE BLACKSMITH, for example (and his DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND ain't too
shabby, either)--and more exciting ones, like George Miller's ROAD
WARRIOR, a giant, hyper-scored what's-coming-after-the-bomb? "Argosy"
vehicle that is an intense, thrilling pleasure to be run over by.  And
there are more thoughtful, closer-to-our-experience features, like the
Australian TV miniseries THE BRIDES OF CHRIST, with Brenda Fricker
every 60s Catholic school pupil's recollection of the social and moral
turmoil started by Vatican II (and exacerbated by birth control and
Vietnam).  Weir himself has made movies more popular with audiences
than THE YEAR OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY--like the goody-goody WITNESS and
the retrograde DEAD POETS SOCIETY.  (He's also made two flops that have
been wrongfully neglected: THE MOSQUITO COAST and FEARLESS.  The latter
is a lesson about release dates: dealing with survivors of a commercial
jet crash, the movie opened in the fall, just when the nation was
gearing up to hop abroad planes for Thanksgiving, Xmas and New Year's.
It's not likely to be part of in-flight entertainment.) But THE YEAR OF
LIVING DANGEROUSLY gives the audience what it wants--Gibson and Weaver
locked in each other's embrace, escaping the approaching genocide.
Backed up by the haunting social conscience of Hunt's Billy, and
Maurice Jarre's Vangelis-in-the-tropics score, Weir mixes Third World
exotic with a tempered Anglo eroticism that remains his most effective
movie to date.  It's the kind of romanticism you wish Gibson, currently
mired in juvenilia, and Weaver, stuck in Purex specials like GORILLAS
IN THE MIST and "weep for me" gasbaggers like DEATH AND THE MAIDEN,
would find their way back to.  They'd be the reunion to bring to the
screen the rapture of Anita Baker.</P>
