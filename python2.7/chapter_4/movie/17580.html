<P>  From the looks of the promotional posters that Warner Bros.
has scattered around town, you'd get the impression that
"The Matrix" is targeted to teens.  Perhaps only the recent
constituents of the comic book generation will make sense of
the plot.  There on the billboard are Keanu Reeves, looking
his usual wooden self, backed up by the marvelously
articulate Laurence Fishburne and the leather-clad Carrie-
Anne Moss--whom you'd not mistake for the 1950s Debbie
Reynolds.  They're wearing shades and leather and they
mean business.  If you're an adult patron with a consulting
contract with some teens, you'll get quite a bit of amusement
from the 135-minute movie and should find particular delight
in the design and special effects.  Like Roger Ebert's favorite
of 1998, "Dark City," this one dazzles the eye, overwhelms
the ear, and even challenges the intellect, as it strikingly
merges the conventions of the Woo-style kung fu, comic book
expressionism, computer games, MTV, and some clever
storytelling ideas.  Like "From Dusk Till Dawn," however, the
movie rocks during its first-half exposition and all but goes
down the sewer in the formulaic action-adventure, shoot-'em-
up culmination that resolves the adventure as though its
designers had to emulate a Fourth-of-July fireworks finale.</P>
<P>   The picture is directed by Andy and Larry Wachowksi--who
ignited the screen with their steamy, stylishly violent lesbian
caper "Bound."  "The Matrix" is propelled by a fascinating-
enough concept--which it fails to develop to an appropriate
resolution.  A small group of techno-geeks discover that the
world as we know it does not exist.  Morpheus (Laurence
Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) recruit a software
designer/computer hacker, Neo (Keanu Reeves), to splinter a
group of so-called Agents who are holding the entire
population in slavery--except that we only dimly comprehend
that we're vassals.  The folks on the planet Earth go about
their dull jobs every day as though there were no alternative
and take their conventional two-week vacations each year as
though no greater pleasures could be had.  We don't know
what the Agents get out of their domination of the world--a
serious flaw not found in the superior "Dark City" (in which
the Strangers wanted to study humankind to learn how to
adapt).  We do know that they serve as the manipulators in a
vast computer program that keeps earthlings functioning in a
world that exist only virtually.</P>
<P>   In short Neo, Morpheus, Trinity and their colleagues must
fight against Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), his two partners,
with whatever technology they can muster.  While Neo
reclines in his chair wrapped in a mask to experience the
world of 2199, he sees himself struggling against Smith.  But
he's not watching a movie.  Since the body cannot survive
without the mind, Neo is no couch potato with a mask but is a
man in real danger.</P>
<P>   The battles include the best action scenes in the movie: a
training session pitting Neo against Morpheus in some
amusing kung fu wizardry that would be the envy of Jackie
Chan, as Neo learns to run up and down the walls
horizontally; and a diverting bit of techno-miracle that sees a
computer programmer virtually create an arsenal of weaponry
for Neo to use in the final shootout with the forces of
darkness.</P>
<P>   To underscore the seriousness of this Armageddon, the
Wachowski brothers cite a host of mythic references.  In one
case an Oracle--played as a down-home, cookie-baking
Gloria Foster--is brought in to predict the outcome of a battle
and to decide whether Neo is the world's messiah.  On the
whole, you could easily get the impression that if Plato's
"Allegory of the Cave" were a movie, this would be its sequel. 
The people of the world must be brought out of the darkness
of false images and into the light of truth and reality.</P>
<P>   My choice sci-fi movies are generous with intellectual
concepts and relatively bereft of swollen battle scenes. 
"Fahrenheit 451," my favorite of the genre, comes to mind: a
fable that nicked the influence of TV years before "The
Truman Show" and "EDtv" were on anyone's mind.  Its
conclusion eschewed a physically violent struggle between
good and evil in which the latter seemed unable to hit the
side of a barn with a plethora of firepower.  The story closed
simply, in a manner that would please Thoreau, as a group of
people in a modern Eden commit books to memory.  Books. 
If "The Matrix" allowed the f/x guys to take more breaks and
worked the storytellers harder, "The Matrix" would have been
transcendent.</P>
