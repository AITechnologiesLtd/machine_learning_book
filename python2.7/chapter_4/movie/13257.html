<PRE>                          MADAME BUTTERFLY 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon

                         2 :-) :-) for the music</PRE>
<P>Cast: Ying Huang, Richard Troxell, Ning Liang, Richard Cowan, Jing-Ma
Fan
Director: Frederic Mitterrand
Written by Giuseppe Giacosa and Luiji Illica
Music: Giacomo Puccini</P>
<P>I love the music of Puccini, and there wasn't any doubt in my mind that
I would enjoy MADAME BUTTERFLY - unless of course the actors couldn't
sing. Although, I had been previously exposed to the music of Puccini on
cassette and radio, I was little aware of what the words actually meant.
So with the help of the much needed and greatly appreciated sub text, I
began to uncover the sinister nature of MADAME BUTTERFLY.</P>
<P>I had the general understanding that Captain Pinkerton would eventually
leave Butterfly, and as a result she would end her own life. However, I
wasn't fully aware of what a bastard Pinkerton (Richard Troxwell) truly
was. To think that he entered into a marriage with a geisha girl, as a
temporary solution for his loneliness; knowing well that by American
law, he could cast her aside anytime for another woman – makes my blood
boil! Although, this story may be fictional, it is probably based
loosely on fact. I have been told, that what happened to Butterfly was
not an uncommon occurrence for that era.</P>
<P>So I'm not surprised that the Japanese harboured such anti-Americanism
sentiment for a long time. You can't expect to be overly forgiving when
American sailors treat your women so badly. This probably didn't start
2nd WW, but there wouldn't have been any holding back over Pearl
Harbour.</P>
<P>Ironically, it took an Italian Composer by the name of Puccini to infuse
his music with such a heart-felt tragedy. One can feel the heart of the
loyal, devoted Butterfly in Un bel di, vedremo one of the most
beautifully created Arias of this century. French director, Frederic
Mitterrand has chosen well, his leads in the Chinese Soprano, Ying Huang
and tenor Richard Troxell.  Overall, a great moving piece of Opera that
will haunt us for a very long time. But if I had it my way, I would have
ended the story with Butterfly carving out Pinkerton's wanton heart with
a dagger.</P>
