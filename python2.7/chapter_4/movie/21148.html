<P>The nature of small town life in the American South is the topic of
this film by established director, Robert Altman. This film follows a
traditional narrative, rather than having a ensemble style of earlier
Altman works, such as Nashville or Ready to Wear, but in typical
Altman fashion, the characters are given surprising depth considering
the number that are presented.</P>
<P>The oldest living member of the Orcutt family is Jewel Mae "Cookie"
Orcutt (Patricia Neal). She is a widow living alone and missing her
beloved husband. Her primary company is close friend Willis Richland
(Charles Dutton), who acts as the caretaker of Cookie's estate, which
mainly consists of a stately home and its possessions. Cookie's
closest family in town are her two nieces, Camille Orcutt (Glenn
Close) and Cora Duvall (Julianne Moore). The eccentric Camille is
director of the Easter play that the small town in putting on, in
which the dim-witted Cora is playing the lead. In the play as in real
life, Cora always taking orders from her bossy sister Camille. Cora's
daughter, Emma Duvall (Liv Tyler), has recently return to town.
Although she has a strong attachment to her friend Willis and her
lover, police officer Jason Brown (Chris O'Donnell), she does not get
along with either her mother or her aunt, who disapprove of the
spirited young woman's lifestyle and disregard for decorum. Life in
the small town is quiet until Cookie's death. Although the frail old
woman was longing to rejoin her departed husband, her departure
resembles a murder scene.</P>
<P>Fishing a recurring theme, as it symbolizes the tranquillity of the
small town and the camaraderie it fosters between people. When people
fish together, the long quiet times together build a bond of trust.
This is why one of the deputies, Lester (Ned Beatty), is sure his
fishing buddy Willis is innocent, even though the circumstantial
evidence initially makes him the prime suspect in Cookie's death.</P>
<P>The languid pace of southern life pervades even the murder
investigation. Although all initial evidence incriminates Willis, no
one really believes he is involved. In such a small, interconnected
society, people understand the character and motivations of others.
Indeed, even as he is being held in jail, Willis is surrounded by his
friends and lives a comfortable existence until the investigation
finally unravels the truth.</P>
<P>Altman extracts strong performances from the cast, except from Close,
who goes too far. Camille is an exaggerated and exceedingly annoying
character. Given the narrowness of her character, she is given too
much screen time. Dutton and Tyler are strong as the other main
characters who are given enough time to develop.</P>
<P>The narrative becomes weak when the uninspired theme of just desserts
and racial politics is presented. This part of the story is annoying
because it is unnecessary. The interesting components are the variety
of characters and their relationships. The criminal act and
investigation give a skeleton on which to build a story, but too much
importance is given to this component alone.</P>
<P>Recommended. As usual, Robert Altman uses a composite of many
characters to draw a larger picture, capturing the flavor of the
locale. The writing is capable when it is developing the characters,
but sags when it becomes somewhat preachy. The acting is generally
strong and enjoyable except for one grating character and manic
performance.</P>
