<P>     The idea behind SYNTHETIC PLEASURES is fascinating enough:  examine 
how rapid advances in technology are changing culture and civilization.  
It's a rich and varied subject with more depth than even a lengthy 
documentary could probe.  And, at 83 minutes, SYNTHETIC PLEASURES is not 
long.  That doesn't stop the film from attempting to touch on such 
varying topics as nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, cryonics, 
plastic beauty, virtual reality, nootropics, cyber sex, transhumanism, 
biotechnology, artificial nature, and terminal identity.  Don't know 
what some of those terms mean?  Well, even after seeing the movie, you 
probably still won't.  Each is mentioned, briefly discussed (emphasis on 
"briefly"), then passed by.  SYNTHETIC PLEASURES is a shallow, rapid-
fire survey, not an in-depth essay.</P>
<P>     There's a direct relationship between your ignorance of the 
material and how much you'll get out of the film.  Computer-literate, 
technologically-minded individuals are likely to find much of SYNTHETIC 
PLEASURES insubstantial and trite.  For those of us who are "in the 
know" (hence, most likely to be attracted by the premise), the film 
doesn't offer any revelations.  It rehashes things that we've read about 
or experienced.  On the other hand, those who don't understand how to 
set the clocks on their VCRs may be in for an eye-opening experience.</P>
<P>     It's hard not to applaud director Iara Lee's intentions, even if 
the results are less-than-satisfying.  There's at least enough here to 
spur a lengthy post-film discussion.  Unfortunately, any such 
interaction is likely to be more compelling than the movie itself.  One 
of the most distressing aspects of SYNTHETIC PLEASURES is that when it 
raises a truly thought-provoking issue, instead of staying with it, the 
film rushes on.</P>
<P>     SYNTHETIC PLEASURES asks a lot of questions.  Is cyber interaction 
a danger to interpersonal interaction?  Are we creating an environment 
we won't be able to live in?  Will increasing reliance upon computers 
add to the already-pervasive sense of alienation?  Does a controlled 
life make for a better life, or does the unexpected make life worth 
living?  However, not only are none of these questions answered, the 
film doesn't offer much of an opinion about them.  We get occasional 
sound bytes from talking head experts, but that's all. </P>
<P>     I was intrigued by a few of SYNTHETIC PLEASURES' observations, such 
as the direction Las Vegas weddings are taking ($30 drive up windows), 
the obsession with controlled environments in Japan (where they have a 
"Golf Dome", "Ski Dome", and "Ocean Dome"), and the level of faith that 
some people place in unproved technologies like cryonics.  The film 
mentions so many issues that it can't help piquing everyone's curiosity 
at some point.  For example, if you're wondering how close we are to the 
implant devices of STRANGE DAYS or the holodeck of STAR TREK, SYNTHETIC 
PLEASURES has something to say.</P>
<P>     Visually, the film is unspectacular.  Consisting mainly of crude 
computer animation, SYNTHETIC PLEASURES' look rapidly grows tedious.  
Since most of the information comes through a series of short interviews 
and the voiceover narration, it's possible to close your eyes and not 
miss much.  For a movie that's about cutting-edge technology, it's 
ironic (although not surprising, considering the small budget Lee had) 
that the presentation is so technically limited.</P>
<P>     Essentially, SYNTHETIC PLEASURES is an MTV-style documentary.  When 
it comes to subject breadth, the movie is in good shape, but at no time 
does it attempt anything more ambitious than skimming the surface.  
Unfortunately, it's underneath, beyond SYNTHETIC PLEASURES' scope, where 
the really good stuff lies.</P>
