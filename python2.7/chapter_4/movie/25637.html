<PRE>GIRLFIGHT
---------</PRE>
<P>Diana's (Michelle Rodriguez) getting into trouble at her Brooklyn High School 
over her pugilistic tendencies while her single dad Sandro (Paul Calderon, 
"Out of Sight") is pushing weekly boxing lessons on her artistically inclined
younger brother Tiny (Ray Santiago).  When Sandro won't give her an allowance,
Diana secretly takes matters into her own hands and convinces Tiny's trainer 
Hector (Jaime Tirelli, "City of Hope") that she can come up with his $10 per 
lesson fee in this year's Sundance Grand Jury and Director winner, "Girlfight."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>"Girlfight" cops a tough feminine 'tude from the get go when star Rodriguez,
leaning on a locker, glares up at us from beneath her eyelashes, recalling
Malcom McDowell's punk in "A Clockwork Orange."  Soon Diana's beating on
a pretty classmate who's dared to steal the less attractive
Marisol's (Elisa Bocanegra) boyfriend and insult her in the process.  She
picks up Tiny at the Brooklyn Athletic Club and hauls off and belts Ray,
a boxer and classmate ('I couldn't resist,' she says).  When Diana goes home, 
she glowers as she performs the womanly duties of serving dinner and cleaning 
up, listens to a TV news report of a woman whose boyfriend set her on fire, 
and watches a neighborhood woman struggle with her small children on the 
street below.</P>
<P>Diana's not all about feminist brooding sullenness, however, as can be seen 
when she begins formal boxing training and the top amateur featherweight, 
Adrian (Santiago Douglas) catches her eye.  She listens to Hector, but watches
Adrian flirt with his oh-so-feminine girlfriend.  Soon they're thrown into
each other's company after an amateur bout, sharing dinner at a diner (she
orders a rare cheeseburger with extra bacon, he has a salad with a cup of
soup) and a ride home.  Adrian's intrigued by this woman he can talk to, and,
after squiring his trophy girl to an event Diana also attends, is forced
to realize Diana's the one for him.  Then the real confrontation presents
itself - Hector is entering his prize boxer, Diana, in the finals for the
amateur featherweight championship - against Adrian.</P>
<P>Writer/Director Karyn Kusama (one time John Sayles' assistant, supported here
by his long time producers Sarah Green and Maggie Renzie) has fashioned a
film whose main character is so immediately in your face you reject letting
her in.  Gradually, however, Kusama's screenplay and newcomer Rodriguez' 
performance win you over before you realize it because they're just so real.
Diana, we learn, has a reason to be angry and has very wisely channelled
it into something productive.  She's also not all fight, caring for Tiny
and Marisol, while trying to establish trust with Adrian.  She's believable
physically, training and sparring in the gym.  She subtly projects emotions
as well, such as when, discovering a home totally unlike her own, her eyes 
dart around, taking in all the family pictures.  She can be plain (particularly 
with an eye blackened!) or show smoldering sexiness.</P>
<P>Support is equally strong and well cast, particularly Santiago Douglas'
Adrian who undergoes an anti-macho catharsis because of knowing Diana and
Jaime Tirelli's good-hearted Hector, a small time trainer whose mind is opened 
when he finds talent in an unexpected package.</P>
<P>The screenplay never lets its characters take routine paths and builds
with a graceful arc.  The climatic scene is preceeded by a beautiful
silhouette shot of Hector asking Diana 'Do you know him inside?  Do you 
know yourself inside?'  The denouement is beautifully realized in front of
the dingy window in the broom closet that's been deeded to Diana for a locker
in the all-male domain.</P>
<P>Kusama's direction is sure and strong.  Along with her cinematographer
Patrick Cady and production designer Stephen Beatrice, a real sense of 
place is created.  Whether on the streets, in homes, at school or the gym, 
we know we're in a real, urban neighborhood.  Fight scenes are immediate, 
with some punches coming right at the camera lens.  </P>
<P>The unique score by Theodore Shapiro is heavily percussive, often sounding like 
castanets backing a metronome.  Sound by Mary Ellen Porto is sharp, punctuated 
with thematic bells and buzzers from school halls to ringside.</P>
<PRE>"Girlfight" is the real thing.</PRE>
