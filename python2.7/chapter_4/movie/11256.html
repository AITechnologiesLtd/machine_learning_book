<P>In 1994, a film was released which became a major box office success
mostly due to the controversy surrounding the picture.  This film was
THE CROW, and its star, Brandon Lee, was killed due a faulty blank
bullet.  The dark mood of the film and its story was given a haunting
twist due to the loss of its star.  The director, Alex Proyas, used
special effects to finish the film without Lee, and audiences flocked
to see how Proyas would end the movie.  However, what was most
startling aspect wasn't the controversy, but its rich atmosphere.
This film marked the beginning of a director's career that would only
grow with his next film.</P>
<P>DARK CITY is a highly anticipated film which deals with a subject that
requires thinking to be done in the theater.  Science fiction films
have been the genre most widely known for creating thought-provoking
subjects.  However, due to the success of big-budget films such as
INDEPENDENCE DAY and MEN IN BLACK, thoughtful science fiction films
have become a thing of the past in pursuit of more expensive and loud
films.  If you don't believe me, just look at the good science fiction
movies which have done poorly at the box office (THE ARRIVAL and
GATTACA to name a couple).  And from the look of the film, DARK CITY
will follow on the same path as those films.</P>
<P>The film itself is a step up from Proyas' debut film, with a better
story, better production values, and a terrifyingly realistic premise.
It's still science fiction, but many of the ideas underlying the film
can be interpreted into our own lives.  Beginning with an interesting
monologue from an unseen character, we are told that a race of aliens
have discovered the planet Earth.  The narrator likes to refer to them
as The Strangers, as they have a ghost-like quality to them.  The main
plot begins in a small, cramped room, with only one light swinging
overhead.  A man lies naked in a bathtub, and suddenly awakens,
startled to find himself there.  This man is afflicted with amnesia,
but more startling is the dead prostitute in the bedroom.  He grabs
some clothes from a chair, and finds a set of keys in the pocket.  A
phone call interrupts the silence, and the voice on the other line
belongs to a Dr. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland), telling him to get out
of the apartment quickly.  He complies, and as he leaves, the elevator
opens to reveal three ominous, pale figures.</P>
<P>He discovers that his name is John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), and that he
has a wife, Emma (Jennifer Connelly).  At home, however, he finds
Inspector Frank Bumstead (William Hurt) waiting to question him about
the murder.  Since not even remembering committing it, Murdoch flees,
but finds himself in an even more precarious situation.  At midnight,
exactly, as he tries to find Dr. Schreber, all the noises in the city
stop.  As he watches, the clocks stop moving, people fall asleep at
the wheel of their cars, and trains stop running.  Then, he watches as
several Strangers walk out of a door which has appeared from a wall.
Dr. Schreber follows.  The confusion only increases when the city
becomes alive, as buildings sprout out of the ground.</P>
<P>Revealing any more of the plot would spoil the mystery, and the
mystery is what keeps the story buoyant.  It seems that many of the
great science fiction films are about the unknown (2001: A SPACE
ODYSSEY, CONTACT).  DARK CITY uses its mystery to wonderful effect,
and ends with a surprise ending that doesn't seem contrived or forced.
Instead, it finishes the film with a flourish, giving another level of
meaning for us to ponder over.  And by the end of the film, DARK CITY
equals the many classics of the past, such as BLADE RUNNER and
SOLARIS.  Many people won't like the film because it may seem like a
muddled mess, but it isn't.  Many critics don't like the almost
non-existent lighting, but that has a purpose in the film.  The film
noir setting is emphasized by the darkness, and an entire plot twist
centers around the everlasting darkness.  Critics who complain about
the film obviously aren't thinking during the film, and this spoils
their enjoyment.  DARK CITY entertains while hiding the message under
its visually impressive surface.</P>
<P>Alex Proyas has constructed a masterfully ingenious science fiction
film which toys with the imagination while preaching to its audience.
His thoughts on humanity are never easy to grasp, and yet they are a
basic function of our human lives.  This simplistic approach becomes
frightening as we realize that we as human beings are really like the
characters portrayed in the film.  Proyas, who also wrote the
screenplay, never asks any easy questions, and the answers are left
for us to determine.  Proyas' direction maintains the steady monotony
of darkness, but the film never gets boring.  There is quite enough
action to maintain anyone's attention, including some awe-inspiring
chase sequences that had me cheering with delight.  The pace of the
film is so tight and so continuous that one wishes Proyas would have
stretched the running time even more.  Several of the scenes seem
quickly cut, and Proyas could have taken more time with each scene
(but this is just a minor flaw).</P>
<P>Then, there are the special effects.  No science fiction film goes
without them, and what makes the thought-provoking science fiction
films separate from the destroy-everything-on-screen films is simple:
the special effects in the latter group are more obvious.  When a film
uses special effects to its advantage, everyone should take note.
Everyone seemed to have with TITANIC, but that's only the tip of the
iceberg (pardon the pun).  DARK CITY uses special effects so
flawlessly, that many people forget that they are effects.  I am one
of those people.  The effects are so seamless that it's hard to tell
what is and what isn't real.  When the buildings twist and bend, you
find yourself submerged in the story and characters so much that the
effects seem realistic.  When a film can suspend your belief by making
everything as real as possible, it deserves to be noticed.</P>
<P>As with all films, the cast is an essential part to the overall
impact.  If the wrong cast is chosen, the film won't have the same
impression.  DARK CITY has a top-notch cast, with zany characters and
terrific performances all-around.  Leading is Rufus Sewell who turns
in a solid performance on an ever-growing and impressive resume.  In
1996, he appeared in HAMLET as Fortinbras, and in 1995's COLD COMFORT
FARM.  He can also be seen in the recent Dangerous Beauty.  Sewell
commands the screen, never letting anything overpower his presence.
William Hurt also turns in a rather humorous performance as the older
Inspector, who is baffled by the mystery unfolding before him.  Kiefer
Sutherland portrays Dr. Schreber with a frightened sense of knowledge.
He is the only human being who knows what is going on, and his rasping
breath gives his character an almost haunting sound.  Jennifer
Connelly is perfect as the film noir-ish vixen, unable to understand
the mad rantings of her husband (and yet she still loves him).  Then,
there are the Strangers.  The most prominent are Richard O'Brien (from
THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW fame) and Ian Richardson who appeared in
the visually-similar BRAZIL.  The Strangers speak in monotone and
eerie voices, almost like an echo coming of the walls.  Overall, an
impressive cast to accentuate the style.</P>
<P>DARK CITY is rated R for violence and gore, nudity, and some light
profanity.  DARK CITY could have easily been rated PG-13, though the
subject itself may have warranted an R rating.  With sets that
resemble BLADE RUNNER and other various science fiction films, many
people are likely to think that DARK CITY merely copied those other
films.  However, the story presented is true to life, and the result
is an original film that has something to say.  Of course, as my
philosophy goes towards science fiction films, DARK CITY won't find a
big audience, and that's a real shame.  DARK CITY deserves to be
watched again and again.  The visuals are rich and dark, the style is
gloomy but not overwhelming, and the action is top-notch.  This is
already one of the year's best movies, and it deserves to be held as
an early Oscar contender.</P>
