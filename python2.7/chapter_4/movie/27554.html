<PRE>"The Pledge"</PRE>
<P>Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) is only hours away from retirement with the
Reno, Nevada police department when he learns of the brutal murder and rape
of a little girl in a nearby town. Drawn to the case like a firehouse horse
to flame, Jerry helps with the investigation and volunteers to tell the
girl's parents of her death. He opens a Pandora's box of problems for
himself, though, when he vows to find the murderer in Sean Penn's "The
Pledge."</P>
<P>Director Penn, from the start of his helming career with "Indian Runner"
through "The Crossing Guard" and now with "The Pledge," has proven to be a
serious filmmaker who knows his craft, but fails to give a range of emotion
to his work. He explores the darker side of life in all of his
behind-the-camera efforts and provides a good character showcase for his
stars, but he is too earnest in his efforts. As such, there is a relentless
quality to "The Pledge" as we see Jerry vow, on his mortal soul, to find
the killer of little Ginny.</P>
<P>The stage is set within minutes that this is the story of a man, a cop for
a lifetime, facing the unknowns of retirement. Like an old bloodhound too
tired to continue but too proud to quit, Jerry, in his waning hours as a
police detective, latches on to his last case - the brutal murder of the
little girl. The case becomes an obsession for the ex-cop when he pledges
to the girl's mother, on a cross Ginny made herself, to solve the case, no
matter what. It's a character study by Nicholson that falters only a little
along the way and is a nice departure from his usual "Jack."</P>
<P>Joining Nicholson is a collection of actors who settle nicely into the film
tapestry created by Penn and his companions. Robin Wright Penn goes out on
a limb, forgoing glamour for gritty in her perf as a bruised and battered
woman and mother who accepts Jerry's offer of protection from further
abuse. Wright Penn gives an arc to her role as Lori, who trusts Jerry
implicitly only to have that trust tested by his obsessive dedication to
fulfill his pledge to another. When Lori sees that Jerry put her daughter,
Chrissy (Pauline Roberts), in harms way to honor his promise, she, too,
sees the depth of his obsession. Aaron Eckhart is serviceable as Jerry's
former partner, Stan Krolak). Benicio Del Toro gives yet another different
performance to his growing resume of character roles.</P>
<P>It's amusing to see the star power of someone like Sean Penn when he builds
a project like "The Pledge." Besides his second time collaboration with
Nicholson, the helmer attracts a bevy of name actors who fill in the small
and cameo roles in a who's who of Hollywood. Vanessa Redgrave lends her
grand dame personage to the touching performances as little Ginny's
grandma. Also appearing are Sam Shepard, Mickey Rourke, Harry Dean Stanton,
Tom Noonan and Helen Mirren in a variety of small perfs that help flesh out
the background of "The Pledge."</P>
<P>The story is adapted by Jerzy Kromolowski and Mary Olson-Kromolowski from
the novel by Friedrich Duerrenmatt. The tale is many things, besides its
character study by Nicholson, including investigation of murder and the
search for a child killer. There is an obviousness to the story, not unlike
Jerry's own, that make the unraveling of false leads and would-be killers a
device used to misdirect the viewer from the real killer. The ambiguity of
the ending and Jerry's plunge into mental collapse make "The Pledge" more
interesting as a character study than a murder yarn.</P>
<P>The techs behind the camera are outstanding. Chris Menges provides
unconventional photography that pulls you in close to the action, using the
camera to give very different points of view. Production design is
striking, at times, especially when Jerry goes the turkey ranch owned by
Ginny's parents. In a brief moment of humor, the turkeys appear to be
gathered to hear Jerry's bad news, holding on to his every word. It's a
striking image.</P>
<P>Helmer Penn knows his craft and how to get good perfs from his actors. His
unrelenting stalwartness as a director is keeping him from infusing
humanity into his directing work, though, and he keeps the viewer at arm's
length throughout his telling. Good acting, especially from Jack Nicholson,
helps save the day and I give "The Pledge" a B.</P>
