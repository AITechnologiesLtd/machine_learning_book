Four Trailers and an Alien</PRE>
<P>I had a great day at the movies today (11/26). The last time I sneaked out
mid-day was when Blade Runner was released. Today was better.</P>
<P>You can always tell if you are going to have a good day at the movies if
the trailers are zippy. Today I got _four_ new trailers and three out of
four where zippy.</P>
<P>Oh. Before we go any further - Alien Resurrection is _great_. Webbies and
reviewers who give it less than 4 stars are science fiction unfriendly. Ok,
on a generic scale you can quibble about giving it a full 4 star rating. It
isn't the English Patient (but maybe there is something good about _that_).
But, if you grew up reading science fiction and horror, relishing the
special effects in 1930's and 1940's vampires movies, literally falling in
love with the Bride of Dracula (I still fall for brunette vamps), then ya
gotta love Alien Resurrection. It has action, it has a likeable crew of
rogues, an evil but efficient crew of military and scientific types that
would be at home on the X Files (or at Roswell in ID4)  in their ability to
"do" conspiracy, and it has the most all-time dysfunctional family since
Beauty and the Beast (the real one, not Disney's cleaned up "new age light"
version) - that's right, Sigourney "I know the Company's not gonna pay
worker's comp for this" Weaver and the Alien. It also has some of the most
outlandish, and hilarious, marksmanship I have seen since those old
westerns. In short, it does homage to the prior Alien movies while carrying
the mythos - and conflict - a step further, and closer to home, and while
also being a damn good movie in terms of reviving the fun of movie
story-telling.</P>
<PRE>The trailers.</PRE>
<P>These were trailers I have not seen before. They were new to me but since I
refused to get Jackeled, Red Cornered or Annihilated, my last trailers were
when I got Brain Bugged and so they may be old hat to you.</P>
<P>The X Files trailer was great. Looks like if they can keep up the momentum
the series might make a good big screen experience. Generally I have found
the better X Files episodes on tv to be better than most theatrical
offerings anyway. The only weakness was the music from the series; they
need to keep the theme but come up with something "larger" for the screen.
The opening was priceless - just Sculley's voice calling Mulder's name.
Audience clapped after it was over.</P>
<P>The other trailer I liked a lot was for Zorro. Yes, Zorro. I kept wondering
why those yahoos in Hollywood were whispering that Zorro would be a big
Sumer '98 movie and all I could think about were the Three Amigos. But no,
this was one of the best trailers in a long time with great stunt work. It
is going to take a lot to make "old fashioned" Errol Flynn style swordplay
and tumbling translate well to the big screen in an era of big scale
special effects, but if any movie can do it, based on the trailer Zorro may
be it. Anthony Hopkins looked surprisingly good with scraggly long hair as
the apparent mentor of Zorro; or will he be the opponent? Anyway he had
presence in only a few seconds of trailer time.</P>
<P>"The name's Bond. [long droll pause]... you know the rest....!" Well, it
doesn't write down well, but Brosnan's on-screen delivery of this one-liner
in the 007 trailer played very well to my ear when he delivered it. I
thought his timing was perfect, and he was droll not Bill Murray/Mr. Bean
stupid. The rest of the trailer could have been cut from any number of
previous movies. I will go see this movie because the bungee cord jump and
tank chase through Moscow last time around were worth the price of
admission, and the rest of the movie was ok too. This series is like a ride
at Disneyland: it may not make you wet your pants like the old wood-frame
roller coasters at Pacific Ocean Park, but you can always be sure a certain
level of quality is attained and at least you won't have to wipe the vomit
off your back from an even queasier passenger.</P>
<P>OK. Now here's a non-action trailer. Hey, I had to read Great Expectations
in my freshman English class (Mr. Flowers where are you?). So I could tell,
with my razor-honed frequent movie goer's intuition, that this trailer had
to be for Great Expectations based on the lists of upcoming movies and the
first couple of scenes. But - no Merchant Ivory period costumes? A
modernized, updated Great Expectations? Ok, close your eyes and scroll down
fast so I don't ruin the movie for you with "spoilers" recollected from
English Lit:
>spoilers coming
>told you not to look
>serves you right!</P>
<P>[Spoiler: GE is about a young English boy, poor, who grows up next to a
rich spinster and her adopted daughter. The boy is given an education by
the rich spinster solely so that he can be her daughter's playmate, and the
boy falls in love with her as they grow up together. But, he isn't good
enough for her, according to the rich spinster; she must marry well.
Sideplot: the little boy during the early stages of things comes across an
Australian "convict" set for deportation down under (or something like
that) and he helps the convict with bread and water, a change of clothes,
then forgets about him. Time progesses. The boy discovers he has a secret
financial benefactor who gets him educated and "proper," and he and his
childhood sweetheart are thrown together by "chance" again. The boy is
therefore sure the benefactor is the rich spinster, who has had a change of
heart and wants the two children to grow up and get married and live
happily ever after. But HERE'S THE SPOILER it turns out that the old lady
all along just really wanted her little ward to grow up to be a man-killing
heartbreaker since she got dumped by a guy when she was in her prime. She
just wants her adopted daughter to rake revenge on the male species for
her. The little boy's _real_ benefactor is that embarrassing (in Victorian
England) social leper, the convict, who has grown rich in England,
respectable, but never had a family or true friend of his own. Guess what?
The idiot kid has no appreciation for his true benefactor, and never learns
the little girl is _really_ too much like her adopted mommy. A real Charles
Dickens' study in character and fate.]</P>
<P>>spoilers over - open those eyes, Dilbert! You're supposed to read the
_comments_ and skip the _spoilers,_ not vice versa!</P>
<P>This trailer, non-action, actually got to me - I am a sucker for kind deeds
repaid. But I can't guarantee the same for you, I guess I am just a sucker
for Shakespeare and Dickens. The two greatest living opti-pessi-mists in
the English language. Guess what: Ethan Hawke looks perfect as the boy
grown to man. Gwynneth "I-can't-have-Brad-I'll-take-Hawke" Paltrow looks
sufficiently elegantly icey, but if it were me, hey, I'd dump her, give my
silent benefactor the thanks and appreciation he richly deserves instead of
treating him like the hunchback in the attic (in the trailer Deniro looks
like Ivan Boesky) and go looking for that cigarette-smoking femme-fatale on
the Pretenders.</P>
<P>The last trailer is Titanic. It is starting to look good (but far, far from
"Terminator II" great), or else I haven't had enough movie fixes the past
few weeks. It isn't Waterworld, and the joke going around is that until the
Titanic, Cameron was "unsinkable." (Did they forget the underwater
ectoplasmics he did?) Still, looking like a movie I'll want to see, but not
at the 11:30 a.m. opening day show like Alien Ressurection....</P>
<P>SHEEEE'S BACKKKK! (Alien Resurrection)</P>
<P>This movie is great. A Ripley that is both more human and far, far less
human than ever before (she delivers the goods with good acting; perhaps
our only "thinking, acting" action hero). Brad Dourif in his quirkiest role
since Dune - and he really shines in his all to brief on screen moments
(best lines since Brent Spiner/Data in ID4 said "we don't get out much"). A
military commander who is no b.s., competent, and in a critical moment
proves undeniably that he doesn't have shit for brains after all. A black,
dreadlocked fast gun who really fills the part of the "gun" and doesn't
lapse into stereotype. A commander of a group of misfits (where Han Solo
would have ended up in a less kind, less gentle universe) who is mean
enough to be convincing and caring enough to be affecting. The ugliest,
meanest survivor of the group, with big facial scar, who pulls a Magnum PI
style smooch that is even funnier than the one it pays unintentional
"homage" to.</P>
<P>The universe is in the details. Brief hints of personalities and
divergences: one doctor asks another if they can sew Ripley back up, and
you don't know if it is out of compassion or a Frankenstein-ian curiosity.
A nurse/doctor attendant who, like a Greek chorus, acts like our conscience
when she can't bear to look at the face huggers attaching to their prey;
and acts as our terror when she realizes that things have gotten way, way
out of hand. An Alien who kills its prey with ironic finesse in a chilling
scene where death is by remote control instead of the Aliens' favored
method of one-to-one. The quirkiest sidekick-victim since Harvey Fierstein
in ID4, who after acting Woody Allen-ish, and caring, in a panicked run,
shows that when push comes to shove he can take his "hits" - even bullet
hits - with the best of them. And still beat the crap out of the bad guy.</P>
<P>What is my favorite scene? Well if you like hand-to-hand combat, this movie
has what I would call "ball to ball" contact. Just when you think, "over
the head, around the crowd, nothing but air" Ripley surprises us with a
move that is astonishing, predatory and - funny - at the same time. Great
for basketball fans! (But wear a cup.)</P>
<P>And when I left the movie theater, I felt so sad - for the Alien. Like all
little kids growing up in America, I realized when I first saw them that
the movies like King Kong and Godzilla, even in black and white on a small
screen tv and chopped for commercials, were statements of power for the
helpless (little kids in America back then _were_ pretty helpless in front
of teachers and police and IBM! not like today), the outsider being beaten
by faceless bureaucrats in white shirts and ties, a statement of standing
up and fighting back. Then Hollywood realized the same and eventually
turned all formerly terrible monsters into secret protectors, secret heros,
and all former "organization man" heroes into villains. Alien Resurrection
has by no means gone this far, but certainly the Aliens in the prior
episodes in this revitalized series were always just inhuman killing
machines with no moral entitlement to an "instinct for self preservation."
In this episode, though, there is no doubt that the humans are the true
aliens ("It was a '_human_' that placed that thing in your chest....")
while the last Alien's tortured cry - I won't give it away - at the end is
truely gut wrenching.</P>
<P>Ripley is as conflicted, angry and compassionate as she can possibly be -
but it never stands in the way of her action. She acts despite her caring
both for her human and for her non-human charges. The movie doesn't flinch
from the issue of her identity and human-ness when it shows Ripleys 1-7 -
she is No. 8 - if she is the most kick-ass Ripley in the series, very
predatory, she is also, finally, the most caring and motherly. The most
human of all the Ripley's after all, though it took mother love to make her
so.</P>
<P>That is what makes this episode great.</P>
<P>There weren't any throw-away characters. Human _or_ alien.</P>
