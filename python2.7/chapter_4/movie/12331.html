<P>Seth the angel (Nicholas Cage) and Maggie the surgeon (Meg Ryan) are
discussing tears.  Seth, who has never cried or wiped away a tear, wants
to know why people cry.  Maggie tries to explain it in medical terms:
the tear ducts overact for some reason, nobody knows why.  Seth knows
the real reason and says so -- there's too much emotion, and the body
just can't handle it and weeps.</P>
<P>Well, it could be that the review format just can't handle all the
emotion I feel about City of Angels.  This movie is too big for a
standard review, too majestic for the limits of this column.  In a
Hollywood that celebrates action and explosion and glamor, this is a
movie that's not afraid to embrace the important issues of love, faith,
loss and devotion that we face everyday. It is, superficially, about the
romance between the angel and the surgeon, but it reaches out past the
barriers of the love story to awaken the hearts and spirits of the
audience.</P>
<P>One of the many things that makes this movie so special is its treatment
of angels.  The movie is chock-full of angels, who appear wearing their
long black trench coats (in Los Angeles?!?), watching the world from
their perches on tall buildings, reading over people's shoulders at the
library, hanging around the beach at sunset, silently reassuring
skittish air traffic controllers, comforting the dying.  But instead of
introducing us to Seth standing atop one of the massive Los Angeles
skyscrapers, City of Angels opens at a very human level.  A mother takes
care of her sick daughter, unaware that Seth lurks invisibly, waiting to
take the child home.  It's a touching and wrenching moment, amplified by
Cage's soulful expression -- and it allows us to see the angels as more
than just icons or symbols of something else.  We feel Seth's pain, even
as he is not able to himself -- and we feel it because of Cage's
wonderful acting job.</P>
<P>And if Cage is wonderful, Cage and Ryan together are electric.  Their
early scenes are almost heartstopping -- actually heartstopping at
first, as their eyes meet over an operating room table after a heart
surgery gone awry.  The scenes where Seth is invisibly comforting Maggie
are silently eloquent, and when they finally talk, Cage speaks with such
understated passion and sincerity that it's hard to believe that this is
the same guy who said, "Put the bunny down!" in Con Air.  As an angel,
Cage is pensive and somewhat lacking in effect, but his rare smiles
light up the screen.  And as he falls to earth and becomes human, the
contrast between his previous reserved demeanor and his joyful
exuberance at being able to feel is intoxicating.</P>
<P>Ryan has a much less showy part, but is equally as effective.  Her
opening scene is similar to Seth's:  after a surgery scene straight out
of ER, she has to comfort the family but isn't able to do it.
Unfortunately, she's not given much opportunity to stretch her acting
muscles -- it's as if she's spending the whole movie reacting instead of
acting.  Nonetheless, she's got amazing chemistry with Cage, and there's
an image where golden light floods the hospital's dank locker room that
deserves to be put on a stained-glass window.  Ryan's main task is to
convince Seth of the charms of being human, and she succeeds
marvelously.</P>
<P>I haven't told you everything about this movie, and I'm afraid that I
can't.  I haven't even mentioned the stellar supporting work from Andre
Braugher and Dennis Frantz.  I haven't mentioned a thing about the great
work of the director and cinematographer.  This is a stellar movie,
worthy of much higher praise and analysis than I feel capable of, and I
encourage you to experience City of Angels for yourself.</P>
