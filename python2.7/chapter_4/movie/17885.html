<P>"Videodrome" and "Dead Ringers" director David Cronenberg is really 
getting on my neRvZ. As a follow-up to "Crash," his 1996 endurance test 
about people who get sexually aroused by car wrecks, he offers "eXistenZ,
" a grisly, uninspired tale about virtual reality run amok. Once again, 
Cronenberg operates on the assumption that if you fill the screen with 
enough creepy imagery, people will overlook leaden pacing, flat 
characters and a tired, obvious "question reality" storyline with a final 
"twist" so obvious that it's almost laughable. </P>
<P>The basic theme of "eXistenZ" was explored more effectively in 1995's 
"Strange Days," and with far less goo. Cronenberg throws so much blood 
and guts into this film that at times I felt like I was watching the 
Surgery Channel on a TV placed in a tank full of bait. I wish he would 
just take a job in a slaughterhouse and get this fetish out of his system 
once and for all. </P>
<P>Cronenberg also uses another of his favorite attention-getting devices, 
grisly sexual imagery. To play eXistenZ (pronounced EGGs-iz-TENZ), 
participants must have "bio ports" drilled into their lower backs to 
allow an organic cord to plug the "metaflesh game pod" directly into the 
spinal column. In addition to showing us the vaguely phallus-shaped cords 
being plugged into the "bio-ports," we're also treated to a shot of one 
character inserting a finger into a freshly drilled "port" hole and 
another of a character licking one of the openings. Golly (nudge, nudge, 
wink, wink), what could David possibly be alluding to with these images? 
One thing's for sure: I would never let this guy date my sister.</P>
<P>The gore-porn motif might be acceptable were it serving a novel story, 
but after an intriguing beginning, the film goes nowhere, and takes what 
feels like forever to get there. It starts at a test session for eXistenZ.
 Volunteers meet Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), inventor of the 
new virtual reality game, and prepare to try out her creation. Suddenly, 
an audience member leaps forward, shouting revolutionary slogans while 
trying to assassinate Allegra with a gun that looks as if it were 
assembled from Thanksgiving turkey leftovers. Ted Pikul (Jude Law), a 
company lackey and virtual reality virgin, rescues Allegra and the pair 
take flight. Unsure whom to trust, Allegra cuts off contact with everyone 
except Ted, enlisting his help to repair the prototype game pod that was 
damaged in the attack. With great misgivings, Ted agrees to be fitted 
with a "bio port" and the couple sets off on a virtual reality recovery 
mission.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Cronenberg's virtual worlds are considerably less 
interesting than the real one. Allegra and Ted spend a great portion of 
the film encountering cryptic figures in a trout farm and a Chinese 
restaurant. Everyone chases each other around while brandishing organic 
guns that shoot teeth, Allegra rubs things a lot and bonds with a two-
headed sort-of salamander and, when not fighting or making out, the 
couple wonders whether they've reached reality or just another level of 
the game. Trust me, this description reads more exciting that it plays 
out onscreen.</P>
<P>Although only 97 minutes long, "eXistenZ" plods terribly before stumbling 
to its trite conclusion. Along the way, a great cast is wasted. Wonderful 
actors like Willem Dafoe, Ian Holm and Sarah Polley are given throwaway 
parts and Jude Law is saddled with a terminally bland role. Remember the 
moment in "The Matrix" when Keanu Reeves says "Whoa?" Law's character 
basically stays at that level of emotional development for the entire 
movie. Only Jennifer Jason Leigh, as the shy adventurer, plays a fully-
fleshed out human being. She's good, but not good enough to salvage this 
production. </P>
<P>"eXistenZ" has some redeeming qualities. The score is good and the 
opening scene features some nice moments. Satiric jabs at marketing and 
consumerism are scattered, too infrequently, throughout the story, and 
there is a dandy sequence where several game users critique their own 
virtual characters. But "eXistenZ" is smothered by lousy pacing and an 
awful "been-there, done-that" feeling. Cautionary tales about virtual 
reality have already been covered quite nicely, David Lynch handled 
weirdness more stylishly in any given episode of "Twin Peaks," and 
Cronenberg's gross-out visuals and freaky sexuality are old news. 
Hopefully, before making his next movie, Cronenberg will review "The Dead 
Zone" or "The Fly" and remember how well he can handle the horror genre. 
Or, better yet, maybe he'll take a walk on a sunny day and try to capture 
its essence on film. For the King of Ick, what an accomplishment that 
would be.</P>
