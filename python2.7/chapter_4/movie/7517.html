<P>     I can think of few things more appropriate to call THE DRESS than 
absurd.  It's a bizarre comedy with a brand of humor that, despite 
making fun of normally-serious issues like rape and sexual harassment, 
can inspire bouts of uncontrolled, politically-incorrect laughter. </P>
<P>     Most films follow characters.  Alex van Warmerdam's THE DRESS, like 
TALES OF MANHATTAN and TWENTY BUCKS, accompanies an object as it changes 
hands.  In this case, it's a dress.  From the design of the pattern and 
the garment's manufacture to its passage from owner-to-owner, THE DRESS 
offers us glimpses into the lives of a gallery of characters, all of 
whom are, in one way or another, losers.  There's a mentally unbalanced 
man who stalks anyone wearing the dress, a woman who wants to excite her 
passionless painter lover, a meek young girl looking for a way to assert 
herself, and a businessman who finds himself on the outs after attacking 
his boss.  The dress has an impact upon each of them.</P>
<P>     The dress seems to generate male sexual arousal, and, as a result, 
much of the film's outrageous comedy is sexually-oriented.  Several 
attempted rapes are played for laughs, and, although these scenes may 
not be in good taste, they are funny, and the director recognizes how to 
stage them to limit the potential to offend.  THE DRESS relies on 
coincidence and the recognition of familiar faces from earlier in the 
film to provide its funniest moments.  Several of the characters 
resemble refugees from such diverse, offbeat sources as a David Lynch 
movie, a Coen brothers' outing, or a MONTY PYTHON sketch.  Unusual, to 
be sure, but also quite effective.</P>
<P>     The film isn't completely without substance, either.  Van Warmerdam 
uses this canvas to paint a picture of a suffering, dejected humanity 
whose participants willingly seize upon any chance for love or affection 
that they can find, even if it's of a twisted variety.  THE DRESS is 
well worth a look, not only because it's so much different from anything 
else currently available, but because it's an enjoyable motion picture.</P>
