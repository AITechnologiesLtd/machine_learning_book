<PRE>ANGEL'S DANCE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<PRE>Ah, the power of books.</PRE>
<P>One day Angel is a sometimes shy, sometimes explosive woman who acts
like a mental patient who forgets to take her medicine.  The next day,
she's a killing machine, thanks to the local library.</P>
<P>As Angel, Sheryl Lee, who was marvelous last year as the hooker in
VAMPIRES, gives her character just the right blend of frightened frenzy
and confident swagger.  Angel, a strange character who "works the
graveyard shift at a mortuary," sees books as the answer to everything
from how to repair her own refrigerator to how to stand up against the
mob.  The writer and director of ANGEL'S DANCE, David L. Corley, who was
at our screening, said that Rosanna Arquette was the first choice for
the role of Angel, which ended up going to Lee.  He also said that the
studios wanted a even bigger star in the role, but eventually they
agreed to go with Lee, whom he thinks, correctly, is perfect for the
part.</P>
<P>The story starts when the hit man that Uncle Vinnie uses is run over by
a truck.  He needs a replacement fast and turns to the cocky but
unproven Tony (Kyle Chandler) as the man to kill an accountant who is
scheduled in one month to testify against the family.  First, however,
Uncle Vinnie sends Tony for training to a murder master who lives out in
sunny California.</P>
<P>As vegetarian, Zen philosopher Stevie Rosellini, James Belushi plays a
character who is everything you expect a hit man not to be.  As the
director told us, he took everything you assume about tough killers and
did just the opposite in the design of the character.  Stevie is a
surfer dude who thinks studying Nietzsche provides the perfect training
for an assassin.  When we first meet him, he's in disguise as a
limo-driving slob.  As in most of the movie, the director cannot resist
the urge to telegraph the punch lines to his jokes.  We know from the
moment we see Belushi that he is the movie's Yoda figure and isn't a
limo driver at all.  "Remember, nothing is as it seems," Stevie warns
Tony.  The director takes this so much to heart that the movie is too
predictable.  Assume the opposite, and you are almost always right.</P>
<P>As part of his training, Tony has to choose a victim at random to kill,
and Angel is the unlucky one selected.  The movie, which is heavy on the
sight gags, has them using a tiny MEN IN BLACK-sized gun with a nipple
from a baby's bottle for a silencer.  For target practice they shoot
water-filled balloons with smilies.  The movie's proclivity for such
excessive "cuteness" may begin to wear on your nerves after a while,
but, whenever it does, Angel reappears and the movie picks back up
again.</P>
<P>The movie ends with a twist that is satisfying and only partially
predictable.  Even if it produces few significant laughs, ANGEL'S DANCE
is an entertaining motion picture that will leave you smiling.</P>
<P>ANGEL'S DANCE runs 1:42.  It is not rated but would be an R for some
sexuality, profanity, nudity and comic violence and would be fine for
most teenagers.</P>
