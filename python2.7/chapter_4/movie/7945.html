                       A film review by Tim Voon
                        Copyright 1997 Tim Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Tim Allen, Sam Huntington, JoBeth Williams, Lolita Davidovich,
Martin Short, David Ogden Stiers, Bob Dishy Director: John Screenplay:
Bruce Evans and Raynold Gideon</P>
<P>How deep can the relationship between a father and son truly be? When
one is repeatedly called 'Baboon' and the other is named 'Mimu-Siku',
which literally means cat piss!</P>
<PRE>The answer is not very.</PRE>
<P>The level of this new Tim Allen comedy is as superficial as its idiotic
name calling. The humour is based on jokes involving blow guns used to
kill flies, moronic Russian Mafia, anaesthetised cats, and the dietary
habits of 'Mimu-Siku'; who shoots pigeons, eats tropical fish, and cat
food when denied the cat.</P>
<P>By far the most interesting character is the hairy, pet tarantula who
uses its radio sonic abilities to hunt its prey. What Tim Allen, and
every other character needs is a good bite from this spider, both to
wake them up and prevent  the audience from lapsing into a undeserved
coma.</P>
<PRE>Adults - yawn.
The kids liked it though.</PRE>
