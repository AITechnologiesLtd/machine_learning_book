<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>Very few filmmakers could even conceive of crafting a film in the
manner which Errol Morris did for his latest film, FAST, CHEAP & OUT
OF CONTROL, and even fewer filmmakers could actually pull it off.  It
is no surprise that Mr. Morris was successful, of course -- he's
clearly one of cinema's greatest documentarians (consider, if you
will, that among his illustrious filmography one will find entries
for GATES OF HEAVEN [his first feature, to boot], A BRIEF HISTORY OF
TIME, *and* the landmark 1988 film THE THIN BLUE), and once again he
has brought forth yet another interesting and completely inventive
film with his newest documentary.</P>
<P>Ostensibly a film which examines the varied occupations of four
seemingly dissimilar men -- Rodney Brooks, a M.I.T. robotics expert;
Dave Hoover, an aging circus lion tamer who idolizes the late circus
trainer Clyde Beatty; Ray Mendez, a mole rat researcher; and George
Mendonca, an elderly topiary gardener -- FAST, CHEAP & OUT OF CONTROL
is far more ambitious in scope than to simply document these
vocations, and is subtle in revealing its intended implications.
Only gradually do the parallels between the endeavours of the
subjects become evident, and progressively the film's themes become
apparent.</P>
<P>Initially, one can see no obvious connection between the film's four
subjects -- one can understandably fail to see much in common between
the work of a lion tamer and that of a gardener, or of a robotics
developer for that matter -- but Mr. Morris cleverly utilises
interviews with the subjects and associative footage of their work in
a unique manner.  FAST, CHEAP & OUT OF CONTROL stealthily weaves
interview footage of the four subjects, at times intercutting the
commentary of one with the activities of another, evoking new meaning
to their diatribes and new inadvertent insights.  However, these
implications are never explicit in their presentation during the
film, leaving it very much up as an exercise to the viewer to detect
and decipher the additional layers of complexity given to each of
these scenes.  It's quite a novel and stunning technique which keeps
the audience perpetually involved, and certainly a method which lifts
the film above the drabness which afflicts a typical talking-head
documentary.</P>
<P>Mr. Morris' film is hardly overly cerebral, though -- while
educational and provocative, FAST, CHEAP & OUT OF CONTROL is also
highly entertaining and often funny.  Mr. Mendez's wild enthusiasm
and clear affection for his blind, hairless mole rats, in conjunction
with his attire (especially the bow-tie) make for humourous viewing,
while it is mildly surreal to observe Mr. Brooks' unblinking
cheeriness during his prognostication of the forthcoming obsolescence
of "carbon-based life", to be eventually replaced by his beloved
silicon-based "lifeforms".  However, it's Mr. Morris' great affection
for his subjects, clearly evident throughout the film, which allow us
to titter at the depths of the subjects' fascinations without a hint
of ridicule entering the mix.  The comic nature of FAST, CHEAP & OUT
OF CONTROL is accentuated by Caleb Sampson's quirky score, as well as
mixing typical headshot interview footage with miscellaneous clips
from old movie serials (including one featuring Clyde Beatty), which,
as much in this film, at first appears to have little relevance but
ultimately resonates strongly with the themes explored.</P>
<P>It is perhaps a good thing that FAST, CHEAP & OUT OF CONTROL does not
heavily rely on the interview sessions with Mr. Morris' four
spotlighted men as the sole basis for its highly unconventional
narrative, for it seems to run out of material about fifteen minutes
prematurely; that the film can continue to confound and fascinate
despite the further lack of insight into the four subjects during the
film's final fifth lessens the severity of this shortcoming.  Yet
another triumph for Mr. Morris, FAST, CHEAP & OUT OF CONTROL is both
a profile of four interesting professions, and a contemplation of the
quickly changing scope of humanity and man's unsated, inordinate
demand for control.</P>
