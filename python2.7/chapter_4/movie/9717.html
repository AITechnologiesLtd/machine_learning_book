<PRE>HEAVENLY CREATURES (1994)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Peter Jackson
Writers: Peter Jackson and Frances Walsh
Starring: Melanie Lynskey, Kate Winslet, Sarah Pierse, Diana Kent, Clive
Merrison, Simon O'Connor, Elizabeth Moody</P>
<P>If you've ever seen Jackson's "Dead Alive" or "The Frighteners," you
know that his big forte is the comic horror film.  So why is he doing a
thoughtful study on two girls' obsession with one another?  Why is he
doing a film where the two protagonists try to kill the one's mother? 
And why is there only blood at the beginning and end?  You'd think
Jackson would defintely be the wrong choice for the director of this
film...until you see it.</P>
<P>"Dead Alive" put him on the map because his gorefest was flawless, and
the best ever filmed.  "Heavenly Creatures" put him on the map because
it's an amazing character study, filled with great style, and some
amazing black comedy.  Almost universally acclaimed as one of the best
films of 1994, Jackson showed he can make critically-acclaimed art out
of film, and not just good arty gore.  And it's true that "Heavenly
Creatures" is probably one of the best films of the 90s.</P>
<P>The "Heavenly Creatures" of the title are Pauline Parker (Melanie
Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet, in her first film role), two
teenage girls living in New Zealand who meet in their all-girl prep
school, and quickly become good friends.  But soon they discover they
have a lot in common, and are soon becoming totally obsessed with one
another.  They begin hanging out together during all their spare time,
listening to opera singer Mario Lanza, frolicking in their undies, and
soon writing medieval fantasy stories of a place they wished they could
share together.  They are, what they call themselves, the Heavenly
Creatures, isolated from everyone else.  And, of course, better.</P>
<P>But while their relationship is one of the closest I've ever seen (going
far beyond simple lesbianism), they have some obstacles.  For one, their
parents think they're far too close, and need to be seperated a bit,
especially Pauline's mom, Honora (Sarah Pierse), who soon finds that her
relationship with her daughter is faltering terribly, especially when
they catch her in bed with the live-in worker, Herbert (Simon
O'Connor).  The parents soon want them to be totally seperated, but
they're so close that it's almost impossible to tear them apart.</P>
<P>To answer a particular query, yes, there's a lesbian scene later in the
film.  It's not gratuitous at all (there's no real nudity), and it's not
just like the required lesbo scene: it's a wonderfully directed scene
where we see they share far more than it would seem at first.  I mean,
these girls are so close that when Pauline is having sex with Herb,
she's thinking of Juliet, and how she has "betrayed" her.</P>
<P>By the end, there's a murder plot to keep them together, even though it
would undoubtedly tear them apart when the facts were uncovered.  But to
those of you who would bitch about the stupidity of this, it's all done
in the spirit of psychology...and in the spirit of the fact that this is
a true story.  Pauline Parker was writing popular mystery novels under a
pseudonym, when she came out to say that she was the Pauline in the
famous case of these two, prompting the development of the film.  Just
an interesting back story.</P>
<P>And what a film it is.  Peter Jackson may tone down the gore to a bare
minimum (remember, there's a murder to be comitted here), but his style
is as outrageous as it always is.  He presents a surrealistic world for
these two to live in, complete with a bit of morphing and animation for
the world that they create and shelter themselves in when things are
bad.  He presents everything from the two girls' view, even little
fantasies (there's a great scene where a priest is talking to Juliet
about joing the church, when one of the knights from their fantasy world
comes out and hacks him up).  Not to mention the sets and colors, which
always create the perfect mood for each scene.  His direction has never
been better.</P>
<P>And the acting is awesome.  Melanie Lynskey, native New Zealander, is
great as the depressed, mopey Pauline, creating depth in her character. 
And Kate Winslet is jaw-drop amazing in her performance that even bowed
Emma Thompson over (and got her her role in "Sense and Sensibility"). 
Kate is one of the most talented actresses working now (as well as one
of the most attractive), and her performance is full of energy, life,
and depth.  These two share amazing chemitry, making it believable that
they should never be torn apart.  Also good is Sarah Pierse as Pauline's
strict mother, creating in her a bit of sympathy.</P>
<P>"Heavenly Creatures" is definitely one of the most engrossing and best
films of the 90s, and the film that will put Jackson in the history
books.  If you still haven't seen it, I highly reccomend you get your
arse out there and find it.</P>
