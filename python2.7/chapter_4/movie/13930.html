<P>   In one happy scene of Kevin Rodney Sullivan's movie "How
Stella Got Her Groove Back," Stella's ex-husband sits back,
shares a beer with her upcoming mate, and gives him advice
that he doesn't need.  He counsels the much younger man
that Stella has a long list of rules; that her new man must
have the strength to fight against and surmount them.  Played
by Angela Bassett, Stella is indeed a hardy, intelligent and
determined woman albeit one who gladly meets her match. 
The film, based on a frothy novel by Terry McMillan, focuses
more on society's list of rules than her own, and we all know
how strong the forces of community can be.  Can Stella
overcome these dictates and, in fact, should Stella contest
them at all?  This is the theme of a movie which despite its
predictability makes a clear statement.  Everyone should have
fun in life, McMillan says through one of life's funniest
characters, Whoopi Goldberg, and if the greater culture
stands in the way, it's the greater culture that's got to go.  If
you're an older man, feel free to scan the scene for young
and sexy babes, we seem to believe.  You'll be clapped on
the back by your buddies for your success.  But if you're a
woman who has attracted the attention of a much younger
man, stay back.  You'll be censured for cradle-robbing, you'll
be invited to be ashamed of yourself.  No matter that through
this sensual and inexperienced youth you've found your
groove, that you're suddenly seeing colors more vividly and
the world as a wonderful place to be.  If you're slightly
seasoned, let him go.</P>
<P>   This is a terrific theme to work with, given the scarcity of
movies that center on October women going out with April
men.  An affair between the 60-year-old Warren Beatty and
the 32-year-old Halle Berry ("Bulworth) is praiseworthy; an
attraction between the 56-year-old Harrison Ford and the 30-
something Anne Heche is fine.  With some sharper editing
and more believable dialogue, the film could have been a
milestone, nudging society toward a better understanding of
Stella's need to break the rules.  Unfortunately, Sullivan's
version tries our patience with slugging direction, excessive
length, and cartoonish characters that you'd more
appropriately find in a film featuring the charming Larenz
Tate.</P>
<P>   Yet another story that proves you can be rich and unhappy,
"Stella" hones in on the 40-year-old title character (Angela
Bassett) who is assured in her job as a high-powered
securities analyst, has a gorgeous home outside San
Francisco, and enjoys the affection of a bright 11-year-old
son, Quincy (Michael J. Pagan).  The house is too large for
her and she's lonely.  On an impulse after watching a TV
commercial for Jamaica (she makes a mental substitution of
her own face for the blond visage on the screen), she invites
her best friend Delilah (Whoopi Goldberg) to join her on the
island paradise.  Over a glass of orange juice in the posh
hotel dining room, she is approached by a 20-year-old man
described by some in a screening audience as an Adonis,
Winston Shakespeare (Taye Diggs).  Responding with the
obvious line that she is old enough to be his mother, Stella is
nonetheless flattered by his attention.  When her initial
surprise gives way to a suspicion that this is going to be the
best vacation of her life, she is faced with a dilemma.  How to
carry the liaison a step further?  If she hooks up with the
fetching lad, she will have to introduce him to her family and
friends and, given the almost certain disapproval of her little
world, how will she manage?</P>
<P>   For comic relief the script, adaptated by Ron Bass and
Terry McMillan from the novel of the same name relies on the
extraodinary Whoopi Goldberg.  As Delilah she has no
difficulty latching on to two hale and hearty guys, enjoying
them with her accustomed abandon.  But here the scripters
break a film industry rule of their own, one which makes a
good deal of sense: do not inflict tragedy on the story's comic
relief.  Delilah's serious illness is pumped for pathos in an
unnecessary sequence, which seems to have been appended
only because the novelist lost her own best friend during an
actual affair with a Jamaican man.  Moreover, Stella comes
across as awkward by repeatedly tacking on the colloquial
"girl" at the end of many sentences, an unlikely idiom for
someone of her age, class, and level of education.  Her kid
sister Vanessa (Regina King) is annoyingly stereotypical, but
her middle sib, Angela (Suzzanne Douglas), best conveys the
mood of an upper-middle-class married woman who is
concerned about appearance above all else.  </P>
<P>   A scene that could have been milked further for poignance,
even comedy, involves Stella's surprise meeting with
Winston's parents.  While Winston's dad, a surgeon, has no
role to play, her haughty mother has the temerity to insult
Stella directly, stating that she should be ashamed of herself
for encouraging a relationship with the young man.  Rather
than accept this criticism without a whimper, a more acerbic
Stella might have said, "If you were more of a mother, maybe
he would not now be looking for one."</P>
<P>   Island photography took place on location in Montego Bay
with a series of southern California locales simulating the San
Francisco Bay area.  A strong cast and solid tech credits fail
to make the relationship believable, but not because of the
age difference per se.  Stella is a woman of the world, a high-
powered investment counselor considering a salary offer of
$275,000 plus incentives as executive V-P of a large
securities firm.  For all his sensuality, broad smile, and politely
forward manner, Winston has been nowhere and has only a
vague notion at age 20 of what he is to become.  What
movies will they see together?  In this story, he opts for an
adolescent pick of the "animal house" variety which has him
in stitches while his woman friend sits with a dour look
throughout.  What music will they enjoy?  What will they talk
about when they get over discussions of the 20-year contrast
in their ages?  As 11-year-old Annie says to her divorced
folks in "The Parent Trap," "Sex isn't everything."  If this
movie wants us to accept the fact that one of society's rules is
irrational, it achieves only the opposite.  Stella has every right
to do what she likes within the law to get her groove back, to
have more fun in life.  The trouble is that Winston will not
provide her with that.</P>
