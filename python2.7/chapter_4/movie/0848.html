<P>     ROCKY V (Sylvester Stallone, writer, Michael S. Glick, Executive
Producer) has gotten a lot of press as the "last" of the ROCKY movies.
It is certainly one of the best.  After ROCKY (Best Picture, Best
Director, Best Editing, 1976 Academy Awards), none of the sequels really
had the same kind of "feel" about them.  After seeing ROCKY V the reason
becomes clear.  ROCKY V is directed by John G. Avildsen, who has not
directed another ROCKY since ROCKY I.  Mr. Avildsen has the ability to
direct people so gently, and to direct action so forcefully, that the
effect on the audience is quite stirring.  Mr. Stallone's new found
love for comedy is also evident in this film.</P>
<P>     ROCKY V starts where ROCKY IV left off, which has been the case in
all of the ROCKY films.  Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) has just finished
knocking out the Russian boxer/killer and flys home to meet the press
and face his next challenge.  The first thing one notices hearing Rocky
talk is that dumb-sounding, slurring voice that we have all come to
know.  Only this time it is noticeably dumber-sounding, as are the
things Rocky says.  What we eventually find out is that Rocky has
sustained damage to his brain, which will prevent him from ever being
licensed to fight again (in the United States).  This is a similar
problem to one found in ROCKY II, in which doctors tell Rocky that he
will never be able to fight again without risking blindness.  Somehow
though, director Avildsen really makes us believe that this will be the
end of Rocky as a boxer.  To make matters worse, a crooked accountant
has lost all of Rocky's money and house and leaves him destitute.  If
not for the pleading and crying of Rocky's wife Adrian (Talia Shire), he
would have immediately gone back in to the ring, probably risking his
life.  Rocky must retire and dedicate himself to figuring out a way to
support his wife and son Rocky Jr. (Sage Stallone).  Rocky Jr. is now
of grade-school age and will have to move back to the projects of
Philadelphia.  Eventually, Rocky meets up with a young fighter from
Oklahoma named Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison), who wants Rocky to train him
to be a heavyweight contender.  This movie is about the conflicts
between all of these characters, a Don King-type fight promoter named
George W. Duke (Richard Gant), and Rocky's strong desire to get back in
to the ring so that he can give his family the life they deserve.</P>
<P>     ROCKY V marks the serious acting debut of both Sage Stallone, and
Tommy Morrison.  Sage is one of two of Sylvester Stallone's sons by
ex-wife Sasha Stallone.  After seeing his performance in this film,
there is no question that we will be seeing him again.  His natural
talent for acting could be described as better than his father's.
Perhaps it is due to the fact that he is playing a character who has
many similarities to himself.  Tommy Morrison was chosen to play the
part of Tommy Gunn, solely based on his ability as a boxer, not as an
actor.  After seeing the film, I do not think that this was a good risk.
His acting could not be described as much better than poor, and it is
tough not to laugh when he speaks.  For those of you who do not like rap
music, be prepared to sit through a couple of long raps during action
scenes.  It's a lot different from the "Rocky Theme," or "Frank Stallone
Jr.," or "Survivor" (all music from previous ROCKYs).  A closing credits
song by Elton John is sure to get a lot of airplay from this movie.
Background music is still done by Bill Conti.  Burt Young returns to
play his role of Paulie.  He seems right at home returning to the slums,
and pulls no punches in trying to bring Rocky to reality.</P>
<P>     I found myself really feeling for Rocky for the entire movie.  His
situation is both believable and moving.  As in all sequels, I walked in
thinking, "This had better be the last one."  But as in all ROCKY
sequels (except maybe ROCKY IV which I viewed as terrible), I walked out
thinking, "Another one wouldn't be that bad."</P>
