<P>Lucrecia Martel's directorial debut, a Berlin Film Festival winner, is a
terrific picture, even though it's pretty difficult to watch.  La Cienaga,
which translates into The Swamp, is about a large family in northwest
Argentina who gets together when their matriarch is injured.  There isn't
much introduction to any of the film's 15 characters, which is somewhat
frustrating because a couple of them are damn hard to tell apart.  Instead,
Martel slowly lets things unfold without much explanation.  It's kind of
like going to your partner's parent's house on Christmas and not knowing who
anyone is or who's related to whom.</P>
<P>The most impressive scene in La Cienaga might be its first, which shows what
I will politely refer to as a zombie pool party.  The in-ground pool itself
is a thick, soupy mess and the corpses around it slouch in lounge chairs
like invertebrates.  When Mecha (Graciela Borges) arises and stumbles across
the concrete on her way to get a refill, she trips and lands on the wine
glasses she was carrying, resulting in some deep lacerations.  But none of
the zombies move, despite the coppery smell of blood in the air (that's
because zombies eat brains, stupid!).  Martel's camera work here is
fantastic, using a shaky handheld to make Mecha's dizzying fall something to
remember.</P>
<P>Soon enough, there's a flurry of activity, prompted by Mecha's children and
servants.  Mecha is whisked away to a hospital in La Cienaga, a nearby city
where her cousin Tali (Mercedes Morán) and her family live.  When Tali
learns about Mecha's injuries, her kin heads to the family's decaying
country estate in La Mandragora.  These two branches of the family tree
haven't spent much time together in recent years and, like most family
get-togethers, things don't always go smoothly.</P>
<P>It's hard to even begin explaining the problems.  For starters, Mecha is a
fall-down drunk, and now that she's bedridden, she's afraid she'll rot away
like her mother did.  Mecha's husband Gregorio (Martín Adjemián) is just as
much of a lush, causing their 15-year-old daughter Momi (Sofia Bertolotto)
to develop a disturbingly close relationship with one of the estate's
servants, Isabel (Andrea López).  Young Joaquín (Diego Baenas) spends the
entire film hunting in the mountainous woods that surround La Mandragora,
even though he's already missing an eye (no word on whether he, like so many
mothers have warned, shot his own eye out).</P>
<P>Tali's family isn't much better off.  She wants to go to Bolivia to do
back-to-school shopping, but her husband Rafael (Daniel Valenzuela) refuses
to let her go alone.  Little Luciano (Sebastián Montagna) has a huge gash on
his leg, a stray tooth growing out of the roof of his mouth and an intense
fear of African rats after hearing an urban legend.  Beautiful Agustina
(Noelia Bravo Herrera) doesn't seem to have much wrong with her, but she
could be Momi's twin, which just makes everything confusing.  There are more
kids and more serious problems, but I think you get the idea.</P>
<P>La Cienaga is set in February, right before Carnival (which, according to
Tali, brings nothing but problems), a hot, sticky time of the year for the
southern hemisphere.  The close, cramped quarters do nothing but make
everybody lazy and pissed off.  Martel's fly-on-the-wall style might remind
some of the Dogme 95 aesthetic, and it's a real shock to learn most of La
Cienaga's acting talent had no acting experience (especially the kids, who
were just residents of the villages where Martel filmed).  It's a gritty,
accomplished work that will ultimately pay off if you can sort out the
characters and their stories.</P>
