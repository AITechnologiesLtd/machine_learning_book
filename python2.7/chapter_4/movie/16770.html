4 stars (Out of 4)</PRE>
<P>Simply Irresistible is not only an extraordinary romantic film, but it 
is an incredibly entertaining, fun, and flat out enjoyable movie as 
well. In a time when filmmakers have committed to making bold moves and 
trying to declare political statements in their works, it is a real 
pleasure to see freshman director Mark Tarlov make a debut film that 
audiences can truly enjoy. And although this film may not be 
intellectually challenging, or the type of production that forces people 
to struggle with themselves over issues that effect their day to day 
lives; it is nice to get a break from that type of cinema once in a 
while.</P>
<P>The plot that Judith Roberts has created is the key force behind this 
film. Amanda Shelton (Sarah Michelle Gellar) has inherited her mother's 
restaurant in New York City which is really little more than a room with 
some tables, a kitchen, and a few regulars who eat lunch there daily. 
Amanda is the head chef, and although her food is bland, simple, and 
unoriginal, she has managed to make ends meet. However, as early as the 
second scene, only after the memorable first scene where she chases a 
crab up her destined lover's leg, Amanda discovers that her rent has 
been raised and she will be forced to close.</P>
<P>After the movie quickly does away with the necessary background 
information, the enchanting love story begins. Amanda runs into the man 
whose leg she had pursued earlier, a wealthy man named Tom (Sean Patrick 
Flanery), who is opening up a $4 million restaurant uptown. And, as a 
matter of the obvious, they fall madly and deeply in love. From there it 
is just a series romantic and comedic moments that will enlighten all 
that see this film. The key to enjoying this wonderful comedy is 
suspending all belief before the film ever begins. Certainly not 
realistic, you must come to the understanding that it is all far-fetched 
fiction filled with magic, and that is why it is so uniquely joyful to 
view.</P>
<P>Acing is very rarely a factor in romantic comedies, and therefore is 
often limited to that of a second class nature. That certainly would 
have been acceptable here, and the film probably would have worked with 
anyone in the lead roles. But the casting was brilliant, and the acting 
is truly grade A. Teenage sensation Sarah Michelle Gellar, better known 
to her fans as "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," is absolutely charming in her 
lead role. She surely has a future in the film business, despite what 
some skeptics may say. Dylan Baker has a supporting role in this film 
that shows us that he can act in non-dramatic productions as well. Any 
doubt of his comic ability, after his Oscar caliber performance in 
Happiness, should be shed now, and hopefully Hollywood will accept him 
as a mainstream actor soon. However, despite those 2 great performances, 
Sean Patrick Flanery outdoes everyone. Often similar to Michael J. Fox, 
he is absolutely marvelous, and one of the pillars that holds this film 
so strong.</P>
<P>Overall, Simply Irresistible is a wonderful film. Filled with moments of 
magic, romance and comedy alike, it is a pleasure to watch. I applaud 
Director Mark Tarlov for making a film that is the way the movies were 
meant to be: Entertaining!</P>
