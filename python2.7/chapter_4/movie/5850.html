<PRE>                                   JACK
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     JACK is Francis Ford Coppola's unusual homage to childhood.
Writers James DeMonaco and Gary Nadeau borrow an overused plot device,
the adult in a child's body, to conjure up the terrors and joys of
being ten years old again.  Penny Marshall's BIG staring Tom Hanks did
this so much better.  The script, is so much more intelligent in BIG
and the acting there is believable.  In fact, if you want to see a
excellent show about kids around the preteen age, WELCOME TO THE
DOLLHOUSE is still in the theaters and is ten times better than JACK.</P>
<P>     In JACK, Karen (Diane Lane) and Brian Powell (Brian Kerwin) have
their first baby.  Jack (Robin Williams) comes early during a costume
ball.  Watching Brian get his tin woodsman suit through the metal
detector at the hospital is funny.  Does your hospital have a metal
detector?  But I digress.  Many of the gags in the show do work.  Most
however are nothing more than recycled bathroom humor jokes you can
find in any low budget kid's movie like PORKY'S.</P>
<P>     Soon Karen and Brian find out that their son has cells that are
growing at four times the normal rate and that when he is ten, he will
have the body, but not the mind or maturity, of a forty year old.  The
show then jumps to Jack at age forty when he is ready leave his home
schooling by Lawrence Woodruff (Bill Cosby) and go to a classroom full
of kids his age albeit not his size.</P>
<P>     Immediately one of the fatal flaws of the show becomes obvious.
Robin Williams does little more than a low key version of his comedy
routine.  It is so reserved that it is only infrequently funny, but
most of all it is not believable.  He acts more like he is six, but
mainly it is just Robin Williams doing his shtick.  I did not buy it
for a minute.  Having said that, the show manages to be funny some
times and poignant others.</P>
<P>     We have a sixty pound seven year old with limbs like tornadoes
when asleep.  When he has a bad dream and jumps in bed with us, it is
not easy, but it is nothing compared to the similar episode in JACK.
Imagine a two hundred pound man and his teddy bear taking a flying leap
to jump between you and your spouse.  This scene really worked as did
the one where the losers invite Jack to play basketball on their side.</P>
<P>     Many of the scenes are sensitive and touching.  The best of these
is the scene where Jack falls for his teacher and can not understand
why she can't be his date to the dance since they are the same size.
Gosh, it would be so easy since his mom would be happy to provide
transportation.</P>
<P>     The best piece of dialog in the picture comes in preparation to
the classic essay question.  Jack, looking very sad says, "What do I
want to be when I grow up?  Alive."</P>
<P>     Way too much of the show is either gross, in poor taste or both.
The boys eat concoctions of worms, spaghetti, toothpaste, you name it.
This scene looks like one of those now illegal fraternity hazings.</P>
<P>     The boys engage in contests of who can let off the worse spelling
gas, and then they set it on fire.  They even get Bill Cosby to join in
on this "fun" of theirs.</P>
<P>     Sometimes sexual relations are treated with respect or in good
humor in the show, but usually not.  There is a scene in a bar that is
in poor taste.  Most unbelievable is a scene where one of the kids in
Jack's class tells the teacher that he wants to be a gynecologist when
he grows up.  She is then stupid enough to ask why, and he answers
because of you.  Think he gets sent to the principal?  Oh no, she just
smiles politely at him as if those sexual references are just fine in
her fifth grade class.</P>
<P>     Although this is a sad show with many flaws, it manages to have a
life affirming ending.  Don't give up on the picture as most of the
critics have.  It does have it moments.</P>
<P>     JACK runs 1:53.  It is rated PG-13 for sexual references and
innuendo.  There is very brief nudity but no sex, violence or bad
language other than the bathroom humor.  The show would be fine for
most kids six and up, but I can not figure out the target audience.
This was a show we were going to skip, but Jeffrey (age seven) wanted
to see it.  He gives it one thumbs up, but one thumbs sideways for
having kissing in the movie.  The sexual references might as well have
been in Lithuanian since they went right over his head.  I can not
bring myself to recommend the picture, but there are some interesting
parts.  I give it **.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
