<PRE>"Faithful is when you've got more to lose than to gain."
          - Chazz Palminteri, FAITHFUL</PRE>
<P>     Despite what the advertisements imply, FAITHFUL is less of a black 
comedy than a disquieting drama laced with wit.  Adapted by Chazz 
Palminteri from his off-Broadway play, the film, as directed by Paul 
Mazursky (DOWN AND OUT IN BEVERLY HILLS), unfolds like a three-act 
theatrical piece:  lots of dialogue and not much action.  Only three 
actors have significant roles, and there are a limited number of sets. </P>
<P>     Cher plays Maggie, an unhappy housewife who, on the twentieth 
anniversary of her marriage to an unfaithful husband, Jack (Ryan 
O'Neal), decides to kill herself.  But, before she can down the bottle 
of pills, she receives a visitor.  Tony (Chazz Palminteri), a trash-
talking, borderline-manic mafia hit man ostensibly hired by Jack, breaks 
into her palatial home, ties her up, then tells her he's going to murder 
her.  Unfortunately, he has to wait for Jack's go-ahead signal, and, to 
pass the time, he and Maggie converse about everything from the CLERKS-
like question of what really constitutes sex to why couples stay 
together when a marriage is dead.  </P>
<P>     At one point, Tony confesses that he has "problems like everyone 
else."  In fact, however, his trauma runs much deeper than the average 
person's.  Both he and Maggie are in therapy (in fact, Tony calls his 
shrink from the scene of the hit), and Jack should probably join them.  
These are three very disturbed individuals, none of whom is satisfied 
with the status quo.  Maggie sees her marriage, and, by extension, her 
life, as a failure.  Tony is saddled by guilt at the part he played in 
his beloved sister's death.  And Jack is looking for a way to pacify his 
young, impatient girlfriend.  For over an hour, FAITHFUL allows this 
trio of characters to work through their problems.  They argue, shout, 
plead, cajole, and, at long last, understand and accept.</P>
<P>     The script attempts to incorporate a mystery element into the 
drama:  who actually hired Tony?  Was it really Jack, or did Maggie, 
lacking the courage to end her own life, put out a contract on herself?  
(Remember BULLETPROOF HEART, where Mimi Rogers paid Anthony LaPaglia to 
eliminate her?)  Was it a third party, perhaps Jack's girlfriend?  Or 
does Tony have the wrong address?  Answering that question, however, is 
far less compelling than watching these characters confront their inner 
demons by railing against each other.</P>
<P>     Cher, who hasn't done much since 1990's MERMAIDS, is effectively 
subdued as Maggie.  She's as believable when her character is in the 
depths of despair as when she decides that she doesn't want to die, 
after all.  Chazz Palminteri, who has done some very good (A BRONX TALE) 
and very bad (JADE) work in the past, is in top form here.  He doesn't 
have the most screen time, but he gets all the best lines.  Ryan O'Neal 
is adequate as the philandering husband, although FAITHFUL demands less 
from him than from the other two.</P>
<P>     At times, FAITHFUL is amusing, although most of the humor is of the 
gallows variety (such as Tony's objection to Maggie's having a last 
cigarette because of the danger to him from secondary smoke).  More 
importantly, the unique perspectives created by the unusual situation 
allow the film to offer insight into the issues of fidelity, love, and 
marriage.  FAITHFUL has a tendency to be too talky, and each of the last 
two acts runs on a little too long, but this isn't an unreasonable price 
to pay for a movie that poses several thought-provoking questions.  And, 
although Palminteri doesn't write with the verve of David Mamet, he 
employs enough crisp dialogue in the service of an interesting premise 
to keep the audience involved for most of the ninety-minute running 
length.</P>
