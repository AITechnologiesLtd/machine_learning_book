<P>Plot: Detective John Hobbes sees serial killer Edgar Reese to the gas 
chamber but not long after confronts a baffling series of murders which 
appear to also be being conducted by Reese. As Hobbes investigates it 
appears he is not dealing with a mere mortal but in fact a demon that is 
capable of passing between and possessing bodies simply by touch and 
that the demon has returned to taunt him and destroy his life.</P>
<P>Going in to see `Fallen', one doesn't really expect it to be much at 
all. The plot seems merely a warmed-over version of the mini-vogue of 
executed serial killers come back from the electric chair films that 
were briefly the in-thing around about 1988-9 - the likes of `Shocker', 
`The Horror Show' aka `House III', `The First Power', `Prison' and 
`Berserker' - only revamped with an A-budget. But in virtually no time 
at all `Fallen' proves that simply through good writing an old familiar 
plot can be made to work wonders once again. And the result is a 
surprisingly good film.</P>
<P>The film is made by Gregory Hoblit, previously a tv director who won 
Emmy Awards for his work on shows like `Hill St Blues' and `LA Law' and 
made the jump to feature films with the impressive 1996 courtroom drama 
`Primal Fear'. There is a surprising similarity of themes between 
`Primal Fear' and `Fallen' - `Primal Fear' you could say is a film about 
a killer who has one body but several personalities; `Fallen' on the 
other hand you could say is about a killer who has one personality but 
several bodies. Hoblit does a rather good job. The script is rather 
handicapped in that its central idea - that of a demon that can pass 
between bodies by touch - has been given away by the publicity machine. 
Nevertheless in spite of the fact that owing to this one knows what is 
going on for a good half-hour before the detective hero clicks on, both 
Hoblit and the script unfold these revelations with a high degree of 
tension and suspense. Hoblit generates some marvellous scenes with the 
demon passing from body to body amongst people at the police station and 
in the street, all the while taunting the hero. And there is beautifully 
written twist ending - the first one has ever seen which manages to so 
twist first-person voiceover completely on its head.</P>
<P>The film kept reminding of `Se7en' which seems to have been a strong 
influence. Both employ the same densely textural washed-out lighting 
scheme. And both are very similar films - about detectives who are 
confronting a Biblical menace (`Fallen' an actual demon, `Se7en' a 
serial killer using the motif of the Seven Deadly Sins) wherein the 
Biblically Apocalyptic is raised into a looming millenarian metaphor for 
moral social decay. Although where `Se7en''s moral metaphors were 
dazzlingly literary, `Fallen''s seem stuck down in the idiom of B horror 
movies. Both films also contain one really grisly scene where the film 
seems to hang still for a moment and toy with the audience as to whether 
it is really going to do the unthinkable and kill off one of the 
detective hero's loved one's. Neveretheless for its ability to move with 
tense and exciting grace and juggle a plot that keeps catching one 
perpetually unawares, `Fallen' is a film that is well above average and 
recommended.</P>
