<PRE>                                  THE PEST
                       A film review by Walter Frith
                        Copyright 1997 Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>     Since Jim Carrey started earning twenty million dollars per film, there
has been a fever running through Hollywood to try and do the same.  For most
comedians, the more you try, the more you will fail because Carrey is a
unique if somewhat unoriginal comedian.  John Leguizamo falls flat on his
face with an unfunny farce of a totally unbelievable nature called 'The
Pest'.</P>
<P>     Leguizamo parades his way through this movie invoking almost every
cultural stereotype and while the film intends to be humourous, it ends up as
a racist and unacceptably lame movie.  A Miami con man (Leguizamo) who is in
debt fifty thousand dollars to the 'Scottish' mob, acepts an invitation to an
exotic island by a German businessman (Jeffrey Jones).  He is told there is
an opportunity for a special scholarship but in reality he's the target for
Jones who is a hunter and enjoys collecting the heads of every race of people
on Earth.</P>
<P>     Get this.  Leguizamo picks his nose, farts, barfs and is barfed on (IN
THE FACE!)  This movie is an insult to anyone above the age of twelve and for
any adult who shells out money for this, you will come away angry, insulted,
offended and seeing red.</P>
<P>     Leguizamo has emerged in recent years as an up and coming bright actor
but has taken a sharp turn towards ending his career with 'The Pest'.  </P>
<P>     Hollywood certainly lacks fresh and original ideas these days but its
comedies have become pathetic insults on many levels and they have become
self defeating in serving a purpose which is to make people laugh.  This one
will make you sick.  That's all.  I'm too angry to write about this movie
anymore.</P>
