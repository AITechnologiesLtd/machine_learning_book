<PRE>                          BULLETS OVER BROADWAY
                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1995 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>     BULLETS OVER BROADWAY is a very funny movie that soars on the
talents of an inspired ensemble cast.  Their success springs in part
from the physical absence of Woody Allen, whose celebrity has become a
distraction.  By staying off screen, he showcases his extraordinary
ways as writer, director, and truth-seer.</P>
<P>     Allen wrings truth from life by spotlighting it with exaggerations
of achingly familiar human behavior.  He enlarges the essence of
things.  When his aspiring artists gather in a Greenwich Village
coffeehouse to dissect the dilemmas of the creative life, they are
universal.  When his characters agonize their ways through life, they
are us.  Allen's double edge is that he shows us ourselves so cleverly
that we squirm while we laugh.</P>
<P>     The movie explodes off the starting block when David Shayne (John
Cusack), a writer of bad plays who believes they are good, gets a shot
at bringing his awful new play to Broadway if he will just compromise
his soul.  Nick (Joe Viterelli) will finance David's play if his
girlfriend, Olive (Jennifer Tilly), is given a substantial supporting
role.  Will David sell out? What's to sell when you have no talent?</P>
<P>     Nick's henchman, Cheech (Chazz Palminteri), will baby-sit Olive
for the run of the play.  Prima donna Helen Sinclair (Dianne Wiest)
will star; and she will try to control everyone who steps into her
reflected glory.  Allen brings the cast together for the first
rehearsal in a hilarious piece of revelation, and when he's finished,
we know the foibles and eccentricities of each of his characters.</P>
<P>     This is a gang of Roaring Twenties-era writers and actors who
operate within the magnetic field of Broadway against a backdrop of
period molls, dolls, and the men who own them.  Gangsters talk about
arson, murder, and revenge as if they were items on a grocery list.
People get bumped off on docks as casually as an employee is
reprimanded by a boss.  It's all cardboard, and it's very funny because
Allen telegraphs his obvious punches with great subtlety.</P>
<P>     Diane Wiest invests Helen with the outrageous behavior of the star
who knows her remaining time in the arena is short.  She toasts "an
ideal world with no compromise" as she and everyone around her bargain
their souls away--except for Cheech, who becomes the noble presence.
He is the hood with a surefire ear for the dialogue of life and an
unshakable determination to protect the integrity of the play he has
made his own.  Chazz Palminteri breezed into view last year in A BRONX
TALE, a movie he wrote, directed, and stole from Robert De Niro.  As
Cheech, his performance is nearly perfect.</P>
<P>     Watching other people mess up can be excruciatingly funny.  The
simplest equations in life are usually complicated only by the tortured
egos of the players, and these players twist themselves into pretzels
trying to make life work.  It's a beautiful example of Woody's pastiche
of crystal-clear contradictions.  It's Woody Allen.</P>
