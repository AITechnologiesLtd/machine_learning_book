<PRE>                  Our rating: two lava lamps (out of five).</PRE>
<PRE>Well, it could have been worse.</PRE>
<P>By this, we mean that Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday is not the
worst horror film we've ever seen. It's not even the worst Friday the 13th
film we've ever seen. But it is pretty much pointless, and loses what
little cleverness it has after the first ten minutes of screen time.</P>
<P>That said, let us focus on those first ten minutes. Like many other such
films, Jason Goes To Hell opens with a young woman arriving at an isolated
location. She spends a few minutes making said location (in this instance,
a cabin at Crystal Lake) more habitable, and is startled a few times by
slamming doors and bursting light bulbs. Behaving logically, she then
takes off her clothes and hops in the tub.</P>
<P>Because this is a horror film, the lights go out, and our heroine must
depart the tub wearing only a towel to investigate the cause of the power
loss. This turns out to be a psychopathic madman with a sharp object. (One
of these days the young woman will merely replace a fuse and return to her
shower, but not this time.) And so, our hockey-masked friend Jason
Voorhees chases the girl out of the cabin and into the woods, where she
falls down, moans pathetically, and scrambles back to her feet, obviously
terrified. She's going to die.</P>
<P>Or is she? Hey, is that a clearing up ahead? Why is she diving behind that log?</P>
<P>Jason is suddenly caught in the glare of a dozen spotlights. It's a trap!
Hooray! Someone finally got smart and sent a battalion of policemen (or
FBI agents, or something) after this freak! Jason is blown away in short
order and his pieces are carted away in a zip-lock bag.</P>
<PRE>If only the movie had ended there.</PRE>
<P>But no, we are then treated to the autopsy, during which Jason's heart (a
nasty black thing) possesses the doctor, reincarnating the killer in the
doctor's body. A couple of gruesome deaths later, Jason is out and about
once again.</P>
<P>By way of a segue, we are given a couple of interesting additions to the
Jason mythology. The best is the fact that Jason is apparently famous,
nationwide, as a serial killer. The "American Case File" tabloid tv
program spotlights Jason's killing spree in the morgue and asks a famous
bounty hunter, Creighton Duke, to speculate on what Jason's next move
might be and how to stop him. Duke (Steven Williams, best known as Mr. X
from The X-Files), of course, lights out for Crystal Lake after the
interview, because killers always return to their haunting grounds.</P>
<P>Now at some point along the line here, it was decided that Jason can be
reborn from another Voorhees and can only be killed by another Voorhees.
So, Jason makes a beeline for his only living relatives, his sister Diana
(Erin Gray), her daughter Jessica, and her new granddaughter. Never mind
that Mrs. Voorhees clearly stated in the original Friday the 13th that
Jason was her only child. Now Jason has a whole gaggle of blood relatives
to stalk.</P>
<P>The upshot of all this is that Jason moves from body to body trying to get
in a position to kill or possess Diana and descendants. The weakness to
this scenario is that Jason is in the bodies of other people, so we don't
get to see our favorite hockey mask-wearing psychopath for most of the
movie. We end up watching various unappealing character actors stalk and
kill other unappealing character actors for most of the hour and a half
that this flick lasts.</P>
<P>On the plus side, our favorite horror movie convention is invoked: Those
who have premarital sex are slaughtered -- and wow, that's pretty explicit
sex! Too bad you guys decided not to use the condom. In today's
politically-correct world, Jason punishes those who decide not to practice
safe sex. Just look at that dramatic shot of Jason's foot treading on the
unused prophylactic.</P>
<P>Perhaps the greatest thing in this movie's favor is that the woman
resolves the plot. Some of our more astute readers may have noticed our
continual annoyance at women who scream their way through an entire movie,
waiting for a man to come solve their problems. None of that here -- all
the man gets to do in this movie is get his butt kicked. It's all up to
Jessica to put Jason away once and for all -- until the next movie.</P>
<P>Speaking of the next movie, the final dramatic shot of this film is one in
which Jason's mask is dragged underground by the clawed hand of that other
horror movie great, Freddy Krueger. This, of course, is in preparation for
New Line Cinema's next magnum opus: Freddy vs Jason. Coming soon to a
theater near you.</P>
