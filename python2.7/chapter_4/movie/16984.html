<P>   Eight years ago I was waiting on line to see "Indecent
Proposal" when I overheard a guy about 24 years old
earnestly ask his date of about 21, "Would you sleep with
Robert Redford for a million dollars?"  "Sure," the sweet
young thing replied, "But you'll have to give me some time to
scrape up the money."  Oh, you heard that one?  The idea
that a woman like Demi Moore could be attracted to an actor
who at the time was 55 years old is absolutely believable. 
But could a 24-year-old get turned on by the 53-year-old Pete
Postlethwaite?  As they say, love is blind, but there's a limit. 
That a woman played by the youthful Rachel Griffiths could
go for Postlethwaite--however wonderful an actor--is as
credible as the idea that Tara Fitzgerald would ignore Ewan
McGregor and set her sights on the craggy ol' guy in
"Brassed Off."</P>
<P>   That's why the producers of "Among Giants" call their
movie an offbeat romance, I suppose.  It's not really meant to
be as plausible and everyday as Robin Wright's discovering
Kevin Costner's message in a bottle.  If you accept the story
as caprice--as though Postlethwaite were having a
midsummer night's wet dream--you could go with the
generally bleak and gritty but sometimes touching story of a
crew of working stiffs painting electricity pylons in England's
Derbyshire Peak District.</P>
<P>   Directed by Sam Miller, who is known on the sceptered isle
for his work at the helm of the TV series "This Life, "Among
Giants" shares with that program's emptiness but breaks with
its glittering and slick image.  Quite unlike screenwriter 
Simon Beaufoy's "The Full Monty," this movie's comic
touches seem forced, its working-class men laughing by
compulsion if at all--as they go through the motions of a no-
future existence as freelance painters working off the books
one hundred feet up, taking pride, perhaps, in the danger
attached to the work.</P>
<P>   Crew foreman Ray (Pete Postlethwaite) accepts a
freelance job under the table from a suit with the provision
that the painting of electricity pylons must be completed
within three months, before the juice is turned on.  With his
rock-climbing chum Steve (James Thornton) he assembles a
team of rugged Yorkshire types who then give a lift to an
Australian backpacker, Gerry (Rachel Griffiths)--who is hired
on the spot by the smitten Ray.  The couple seem
mismatched by age and appearance.  The obvious choice for
Gerry would be the young and handsome Don Juan, Steve
(James Thornton).  As Ray and Gerry make goo-goo eyes at
each other one hundred feet up, they arouse the antipathy of
the envious Steve, the demoralized workers, and finally Ray's
estranged wife.  When Ray and Gerry have a falling out,
Gerry momentarily shifts her attention to Steve, causing
increased friction between Ray and his best friend.  The plot
takes an unusual turn when the frustrated Gerry commits the
self-destructive act of climbing the rocks without a belt.</P>
<P>   The most interesting character is Gerry, who is not your
typical Maupintour traveler.  Off on her own from Australia to
the English hills, she fearlessly hitches rides around
Derbyshire and beyond, admitting to occasional loneliness--
which could explain her bonding with the much older
foreman.  When Ray, who finds it as difficult as the audience
to accept the love that is offered to him, asks her why she
doesn't go for young Steve, she replies, "He's not my type. 
Maybe he's too much my type.  I've had loads of Steves; it
never works out."  </P>
<P>   Nor does the movie.  Though we get a sense of working-
class life among a diverse, adventurous bunch of sentimental
Brits--the Saturday night dance scene a la American West;
the downing of endless ales in the local pub; the camaraderie
that comes from togetherness in the wide open spaces--
nothing really happens to the workers, who seem to exist only
to observe and comment upon the romantic interludes of the
three principals.  The film follows working-class formulas:
workers disgruntled because of overdue paychecks, one
laborer needing an advance because he's one step ahead of
the loansharks, a woman seeking her identity through travel. 
Postlethwaite had far far more to work with in his greatest
piece, "In the Name of the Father," and was more realistically
cast as a band leader in  "Brassed Off," while Rachel Griffiths
was astonishing in "Hilary & Jackie," merely functional in the
current selection.</P>
