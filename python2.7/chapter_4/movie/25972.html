<PRE>A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Rarely is any movie such a director and actor triumph. The overall theme of Nu
rse Betty is taking risks, traveling the open road, and discovering the 
person you really are. This applies to both the characters in the movie, and 
the actors playing them. For director Neil LaBute, this film shows he's 
equally skilled at directing material that isn't his own. Screenwriters James 
Flamberg and John C. Richards get a chance to show off their superior wit and 
skill. The screenplay also provides a comic breath of fresh air for each of 
the lead actors. This thing is just ablaze with talent.</P>
<P>Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) lives in the small town of Fair Oaks, Kansas 
with her abusive dimwit husband Del (Aaron Eckhart). Betty's life revolves 
around a hospital soap opera called A Reason to Love that stars George McCord 
(Greg Kinnear) as dashing lead doctor David Ravell. In addition to committing 
adultery, Del's involved in a drug deal with Charlie (Morgan Freeman) and 
Wesley (Chris Rock). One night Del invites the men home for a business 
discussion. He is unaware that Betty is watching a tape of her favorite show 
in the next room. Since Del hasn't delivered some promised heroin, Charlie 
and Wesley assume he's keeping it for himself. So they kill him, and Betty 
witnesses the whole thing. She goes into a state of shock. When she hears Dr. 
Ravell on television saying, "There must be something special out there for 
me," Betty assumes he must be talking about her. She heads to Los Angeles in 
hopes of finding her "ex-fiancee," and starts accepting the show as truth. 
What she doesn't know is that her car has that missing heroin in the trunk. </P>
<P>It's about time that Renee Zellweger received a good comic role. Both The 
Bachelor and Me, Myself & Irene saw her humor opportunities limited by a bad 
leading man. This film hands her many chances to shine, and she gives a 
brilliant performance. The whole picture rides on her shoulders, and she 
makes a very good leading lady. Thank casting directors Heidi Levitt and 
Monika Mikkelsen for the appearance of Morgan Freeman. Like Steve Martin, he 
is one of America's most outstanding, but underused actors. The job he does 
here, and the chemistry he has with the Chris Rock character, steals the 
whole movie. Rock is good too, if a bit familiar. They are best when 
together. Greg Kinnear, after a string of flops, shows why he became such a 
big actor. His biting work exemplifies some of Hollywood's crueler 
personalities. </P>
<P>The screenplay has a steady pace and creates room for small, memorable 
characters. At the same time, it generates outrageously hilarious scenes that 
are just priceless. Betty is a perfectly established persona, and since 
everyone in the film is so quirky no individual's actions seem random and 
without meaning. Movement between the various locales is surprisingly fluid 
thanks to dexterous directing and editing. However, all things are not 
completely rosy in Fair Oaks or Los Angeles. There is quite a bit of violence 
that doesn't fit the tone of the movie. While nothing overly graphic takes 
place, the scalping and shoot-outs didn't need to be as bloody as they were. 
The film dips ever-so-briefly into some sex humor that's not required. Beyond 
that material, few jokes ever fail.</P>
<P>Everything about this movie is different. That may be why USA Films is 
releasing Nurse Betty, which is at its heart an independent film, to 
multiplexes. They're probably trying to create another comedy sleeper like 
last year's Being John Malkovich, which they also released. This movie isn't 
quite that unique, but is considerably less dark, and no less inspired. See 
this movie, tell a friend about it, and have a good time. It is the antidote 
to a summer of boring and predictable flicks.</P>
