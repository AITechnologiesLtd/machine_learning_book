<P>High-school kids are human, but you'd hardly think so from a large number
of movies about them, including Can't Hardly Wait. It's the first
directorial effort by Kaplan and Elfont whose main claim to fame was being
among the five writers of A Very Brady Sequel.</P>
<P>A few teen films have been on the thoughtful side: the classic
post-graduation American Graffiti, the excellent end-of-school-year Dazed
and Confused (by Richard Linklater),  some works by John Hughes  (The
Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles), the funny-to-hilarious Fast Times at
Ridgemont High (by Amy Heckerling), Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Weird Science
(both by Hughes).</P>
<P>Note that the Hughes titles above were set in Illinois, while Dazed and
Confused  is in Texas. The school of the CHW kids is in California, the
center of the universe as per Hollywood. The sad denial of another America
beyond the southern Pacific coast continues, obviously for practical
filmmaking reasons.</P>
<P>The opening credits are a quick, cutesy way to introduce the main
characters, their accomplishments, aims, favorite quotes, etc.  As a rule
this gimmick makes one suspect the worst. One quote is "A true friend stabs
you in the front," attributed to Oscar Wilde. I cannot guarantee its
authenticity, but a search for it turned up a Wildeism more germane to the
film: "There is no sin, except stupidity."</P>
<P>The film's title must refer to the impatience of the kids to leave
adolescence for maturity, as well as to the state of English in schools.
Following the seniors' graduation ceremony, their class has the usual
ritualistic bash--in the home of a girl who ought to have known better
than volunteer the place. The party is a rite of passage --not the Rites of
Spring but the Trites of Spring. The motto, as in other such events, must
be Brew and Screw.</P>
<P>For its characters, the filmmakers round up the usual suspects, all of them
types found in the teen genre. If there is some originality here, it is
well-hidden by cliches gathered from earlier flicks. CHW's  deja vu types
and actions make up a pot-pourri, an expression where "pourri" means
"putrid." But this epithet would be too strong a condemnation of a movie
whose main guilt is total  superficiality.</P>
<P>The action almost entirely takes place at the shindig. Celebrants range
from geeks to nerds to jocks to cuties.  Without a central plot or guiding
thread, the whole thing is just a collection of skin-deep subplots. The
main one is this: athletic Mike, the BMOC, has just dumped Amanda, his girl
since freshman class, as part of "game plan" with his pals. The idea is
that those among them who are going on to college will have women by the
regiment falling into their arms and beds, so why not break with the boys'
current liaisons? It's not only a dumb idea but a revoltingly cynical one.</P>
<P>Learning this, college-bound would-be writer Preston  wants to declare his
love to now-uncommitted Amanda. He is a likable, shy fellow who has been
adoring her silently ever since they both were freshmen. In a flashback to
four years ago, the movie goofs by showing Amanda, Preston and others
looking exactly as they do now. Add to this the sin that Hollywood has been
committing since silent  movie days and in many contemporary films as well:
too many screen students --high-schoolers or undergraduates--are
perceptibly older than they would be in real life.</P>
<P>Preston comes to the party with his confidante and best pal Denise. She is
brainy a la Janeane Garofalo, even  looks like a mix of Garofalo and a
young Kathy Bates. She lacks confidence in her own appearance, is outside
the girlish loop,  critical of others, has a mordant tongue. Another
subplot will involve her being accidentally locked inside a bathroom with
Seth, with predictable consequences. He is  a white boy whose solution to
having an identity has been to adopt a black personality in dress, speech,
manners, music, and the like. (There are, by the way, some merely token
minority students at the party)</P>
<P>As for Amanda, she's been a kind of First Lady all along, Queen of this and
of that. She is nice but, like almost everyone else, not a thinking person.
(You wonder how the vague Preston will perform  as a writer)  Amanda does
get the film' s main profundity when she realizes (and confesses a bit
pathetically) that all her glory came from being Mike's satellite. With
some people, it takes time to see the obvious.</P>
<P>I will not mention other characters, events or gratuitous developments of
CHW. The partygoers, are without exception not just undeveloped but
undersketched. There are  few small saving graces. One is the movie's
relative briefness. Even though the title calls for the joke I Could Hardly
Wait For It To Finish, I did not find it unbearable -- just blah. Another
is that Preston is neither depicted as pathologically shy nor as a
caricature intellectual. There are no drop-dead gorgeous women. And, in a
near-surreal sight, as Preston tries to use a public phone, a woman, a
tired stripper with fake angel wings,  hassles him for the use of the
cabin. She is played by the uncredited Jenna Elfman, who recently had a
major part in Krippendorf's Tribe and is married to the nephew of composer
Danny Elfman.</P>
<P>Obviously made for high-schoolers who may or may not get some mini-shocks
of recognition, and full of references to current pop culture, CHW will
survive only if its target audience shows up.</P>
