<P>The world needed American Pie about as badly as it needs Dubya leading it
into oblivion.  It was Porky's for the next generation (believe me, kids -
that's no compliment); a funny, teen-oriented film that people flocked to
even though they already knew its biggest gags.  Aside from the strong
performance by Jason Biggs, the three other main characters were so
painfully bland, they could be described as The Guy Who Acts Like He's 40
(Eddie Kaye Thomas), The Guy Who Acts Like He's Retarded (Chris Klein) and
The Guy Who May As Well Not Even Be There (Thomas Ian Nicholas).  And the
aforementioned world needs a sequel to Pie as badly as it needed Porky's 2:
The Next Day.</P>
<P>When we last saw our four Michigan misfits, Oz (Klein, Say It Isn't So) had
just fucked glee-club nerd Heather (Mena Suvari, Sugar & Spice), Kevin
(Thomas Ian Nicholas) had just fucked longtime girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid,
Josie and the Pussycats), and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas, Freddy Got Fingered)
had just fucked Stifler's mom (Jennifer Coolidge, Legally Blonde).  Our
hero, the nebbish Jim (Biggs, Saving Silverman), had fucked band geek
Michelle (Alyson Hannigan, Buffy the Vampire Slayer), after, of course,
fucking a pie and coming really close (twice) to fucking Nadia, a Czech
exchange student with a really bad accent (Shannon Elizabeth, Tomcats).</P>
<P>Hey, why mince words?  Pie was a movie about fucking, and the sequel isn't
any different.  Pie 2 opens just after the gang's freshman year of college
as they tackle the 12 weeks of summer with a party-minded vengeance.  Oz is
patiently waiting for Heather to return from a European trip so he can fuck
her.  Kevin really wants to fuck Vicky again, but she just wants to be
friends.  Finch can't stop thinking about fucking Stifler's mom, and poor
Jim is about to fuck a classmate (Joelle Carter, Just One Time) when his dad
(Eugene Levy, Down To Earth) walks in on them in the film's opening salvo.</P>
<P>It's a funny scene, but just about the entire thing is shown in Pie 2's
trailer, which was a big problem with the first film, as well.  When the
people sitting behind you at an advance screening recite the dialogue along
with the actors, you know they've divulged too much of the film in the
coming attractions.  Pie 2 is essentially built around five set pieces that
are very funny and extremely well-executed.  But two of these five scenes
are shown in the trailer, and everything that takes place between these five
scenes is crap.</P>
<P>When Stifler's (Seann William Scott, Evolution) summer party palace is
busted up by the fuzz, Kevin's wise old brother (Casey Affleck) suggests the
quintet rent out a summer home on Lake Michigan.  Most of the action takes
place here, where the boys are forced to get jobs as house painters to
afford their swank new digs.  And, of course, they get themselves in various
sexual predicaments that usually lead to subtle-as-a-jackhammer Pepsi
product placement.</P>
<P>To top it off, this Gen-Y Porky's is packed full of songs by blink-182, 3
Doors Down, Sum 41 and a myriad of other lame Abercrombie-core bands with
numeric monikers (I think my musical combo is going to be called Smell My
Weiner 285).  It might be easy to overlook the fact that most of these
"kids" are too old for grad school, but it's downright shocking to learn
that 22-year-old Natasha Lyonne (Scary Movie 2) is one of the youngest
actresses involved in Pie 2 (Elizabeth is 28, Hannigan 27, Reid 26).</P>
<P>Original directors Chris and Paul Weitz are producers here, handing the
reins over to James B. Rogers (Say It Isn't So), who was an associate
producer and assistant director on the first Pie.  Grand Rapids native Adam
Herz once again provides a script full of shocking, gross-out humor that is
rooted exclusively in bodily fluids and copulation.  If you like that kind
of humor, and aren't put off by the fact that most of the laughs have
already been given away for free, then Pie 2 will be a surefire hit.</P>
<P>1:40 - R for strong sexual content, crude humor, language and drinking</P>
