<P>I walked into "The English Patient" expecting to see "an epic story of love
and war," and unfortunately, that's exactly what I got. This is one of the
most disguised films I've ever seen; a melodramatic soap opera pretending to
be a moving and touching film of grand proportions. It has very little charm,
characters without depth, and a very formulated, predictable, and boring
story.
Ralph Fiennes stars as Count Laszlo de Almasy, who is some kind of British
military intelligence officer fighting in World War II. As the film opens, he
is shot down in his biplane and burned very badly. He is taken in by a MASH
unit and later moved to a deserted house way out in the Italian countryside
where a nurse named Hana (Binoche) takes care of him and listens to his long
story of how he got to where he is now. 
One of the film's biggest flaws is present immediately, as it takes a long
time for this little amount of action to occur. It also feels the need to use
every overly dramatic and sappy device possible. Hana's entire character
allows for countless cliches: she has a heart of gold kisses wounded
soldiers; her friend is killed five seconds after she says "I love you" to
her; she actually says aloud why she cares for her patients. Even the fact
that Almasy's disfigured face is constantly shown is a bit melodramatic. We
feel sorry for him because of his appearance, not because of his character.
What makes for good love stories is characterization of the lovers, their
chemistry, and their situation. This film establishes none of these, instead
it just depicts a passionate affair we're supposed to care about. Through
constant flashbacks we learn Almasy was part of an Allied military troupe,
and from the moment Katherine (Scott-Thomas) (his friend's wife) appears, it
is obvious they will fall for each other. But there is no substance to their
so-called relationship. The dialogue is too poetic and overly romantic, and
therefore completely unbelievable because people don't talk so eloquently, so
Shakesperian-esque in reality.
The actual storytelling is very choppy: it skips back and forth between the
present and the past just as something starts to become interesting. And then
when Almasy's relationship seemed to be the driving force for the film, it is
nearly forgotten as the focus shifts to the nurse and her romantic encounter
with an Indian bomb defuser, and then to a Canadian spy named Caravaggio -
"Moose" (Dafoe). Some of the individual scenes showing the characters'
stories are interesting, but nothing comes together as a whole. 
Usually it is the action/adventure movies that contain the most unbelievable
events, but melodrama often does the same thing. Katherine and her husband
are involved in a plane crash, but miraculously only Katherine survives. Then
there is the typical scene where Almasy drags her to a cave (in the middle of
the desert) and promises to return with help. He survives a three-day walk
through the burning desert to an embassy of some sort, but is arrested when
he is considered insane. He then proceeds to single-handedly escape his
shackles, jumps off a speeding train, and then is able to find the exact same
cave. And I thought "Indiana Jones" was a bit over the top!
I walked out of "The English Patient" very frustrated and disappointed. The
film does have a good sense of style and production, but its plot is
shamefully exploitative and its storytelling is jumbled. I can usually detect
subtle-but-powerful emotions and plot devices, but I didn't see anything
remotely profound here.</P>
