<P>David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" was one of the most influential films of the 
1980's, and arguably jump-started the idea of independent filmmaking. 
But aside from that, it is also one of the most original, invigorating 
films I've ever seen.</P>
<P>In a tour de force opening sequence, which has been widely praised, 
brightly-lit, picture-perfect clips are shown of a small town: a man 
watering his green lawn, a milkman waving as his truck drives by, 
flowers blooming beside a picket fence...and then the happiness of the 
scene vanishes as the man watering his lawn collapses on the ground, and 
the camera slowly burrows down through the glass until it comes upon a 
mound of bugs, symbolizing the dark secrets buried in the seemingly 
perfect town.</P>
<P>The film then switches to a college student (Kyle MacLachlan) returning 
to his hometown of Lumberton to stay for awhile and visit his father in 
the hospital. While walking through a field, he spots a human ear lying 
on the ground, which leads to him meeting up with the town's sheriff's 
teenage daughter (Laura Dern), and convincing her to help him out to 
solve the mystery of the ear, which involves a nightclub singer 
(Isabella Rossellini), murder, and a sadistic kidnapper/drug dealer 
(Dennis Hopper).</P>
<P>One of the many pleasures of "Blue Velvet" is watching this 
multi-layered, intricate mystery unravel and develop, and it would be 
criminal to give anything else away. It is completely unpredictable, and 
the characters, just like the plot, are true originals. MacLachlan is a 
perfect center for the movie, Rossellini is superb as the tortured 
singer, Hopper is very, very creepy as the kidnapper, and Dern is 
outstanding, giving one of her best performances to date, and bringing 
much depth to her role, as well as her sweet, tender relationship with 
MacLachlan.</P>
<P>"Blue Velvet" also involves a masterstroke of style and atmosphere. 
Lynch wonderfully gives the movie a film noir feel, but it also has a 
small-town, postcard essence, which mixes together brilliantly to create 
a look and feel never before seen on film. </P>
<P>The opening scene, as already noted, is flawlessly realized, and is a 
perfect contrast to the darker elements of the story, and town. It is 
also a picture that could not be placed in a specific era. Some elements 
are right out of the 1950's, but it could also very well be set in the 80's.
The same thing goes for its location. The town is called Lumberton, but it
pretty much is set in 
Anywhere, U.S.A.</P>
<P>There is no doubt that "Blue Velvet" contains many disturbing moments, 
and much of it involves sadomasochistic behavior, sex, degradation, and 
elements of an even darker nature. But it is at this level that "Blue 
Velvet" succeeds in becoming a true masterpiece in all senses of the 
word, because these terrible things occur in this quiet, peaceful little 
town, which harkens back to the opening of the film. It makes the point 
that no town, no matter what, is perfect, because there will always be 
something dark hiding right behind the surface, and it is called human 
nature. </P>
