<P>If you like Willy, this IS as good as it gets.  Though it is a bit too
wordy for most of us, this is one of those productions where the passages
somehow make sense, and don't lead you astray very much.  I do recommend you
take a break somewhere in the middle of it, because it IS really intense.</P>
<P>Peter Brook got his start with theatre in England, and has specialized in
Shakespeare, though his best work is in the field of experimental theatre.
This LEAR is not set on a stage, thus freeing it from the overly confined
spacing which befalls all of Willy's work.  It is not a theatrical
production of any kind, for example, there is no music beyond what is heard
and required in the scenes ( the FOOL playing his lute, etc ) and the sound
effects are nature's wonders.  The usual stage allegories are done away
with, and the strong scenes, like the storm/thunder moments are actually
done outside in an environment that I don't think many actors enjoy working
on, and with, ... it is very difficult to act with robes that weight nearly
50 to 75 lbs. and on top of it are wet,... and the scene continues,...</P>
<P>The actors here are Paul Scofield as LEAR ( geesus h charrrist ); John Hurt
( ever wonder where he got started? ); Diana Rigg; Cyril Cusach; Patrick
Magee, Ian Hogg.  Stunning camera work and editing.  The most realistic
costumes you ever will see in a Willy production.  Filmed in northern
England in the area where it would have taken place.</P>
<P>It all makes for a rather 'brutal' presentation of Willy's, but one which is
reminiscent of the same appeal which Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet did in
the late sixties.  It is thorough, it is honest, and lays it on the line. If
you like literature, and an occasional Willy, take a dose of this.</P>
<PRE>Peter Brook's other fine films worth seeing;
        Lord of Flies ( early sixties ) the novel is Henry Fielding, and
        the children are something else.  The American remake a few years
        back couldn't kiss the r... end of this one.</PRE>
<P>        Meetings With Remarkable Men ( mid seventies, occasionally found
        in the shelves of the new age stores,... gasp,  GASP, ... ) based on
        Gurdjieff's books and life, with incredible scenery in Afghanistan,
        Pakistan, Egypt, and northern India.  And the ending will just floor
        you.  Features Terence Stamp, Athol Fugard ( he single handedly owes
        his fame to Peter Brook's productions of his work,......in SOUTH
        AFRICA, too,.... they weren't about to insult the best art in the
        land, were they,... take that DeKlerk... Athol is black,... Sizwe
        Banshe is Dead and several other plays. ), and many others.</P>
<PRE>        The Mahabharata.  With the script by himself and Jean Claude
Carriere,
        who had written many films for Luis Bunuel, Jean Luc Godard, and
        Francois Truffaut, they put together a ten hour play,... about the
        beginning of earth, and the Gods that ruled it then, based on the
        book of the same name from India.  The book is older than the oldest
        Hebrew scriptures known to man, by at least five thousand years.
The
        play had first been done in Paris, where Mr. Brook has a special
        theatre/acting school comprising of actors from at least thirteen or
        fourteen different cultural backgrounds.  The production, which was
        shown on PBS a few months ago, was adapted for film.  And it was an
        experience which was hard to top.</PRE>
<PRE>        Theatre... A midsummer's night dream ... traveled with it in the
        early sixties.  Done in a frame like playground ( I guess ) much
like
        the ones you find in the parks with sand on them,  it featured Diana
        Rigg ( The Avengers ), David Warner ( Strawdogs, Morgan ) and the
        Royal Shakespeare Company.  There is a video of this production
around
        in the black market.  It is worth nearly $500.00 per copy.
        ... Marat/Sade ... Most incredible play of the 20th century.  Made
        Glenda Jackson, Ian Richardson, and Patrick Magee famous.  Taken
from
        the play by Peter Weiss, it was an incredible assault on the
hierarchy
        of government,... a most revolutionary evening of theatre, if you
wish to
        find out how Charlotte Corday killed Jean Paul Marat, the scene
taken
        directly from the famous DAVID painting from the 18th century.  If
you
        are a theatre major, you must see this, and then decide if this kind
        of life is for you..... It is because of this production that John
        Lennon and Paul McCartney went out and wrote Revolution and
Revolution
        # 9 for the white albums.... there are direct moments from the play
        all over the album,...  if you ever wonder where rock'n'roll got
some
        inspiration,...</PRE>
<P>Peter Brook's work is always challenging, and does not bang you over the
head  with 'heavy' meanings.  But the intensity of the work, and how it's
done will surely awake your mind up,...   highly recommended for serious
enthusiasts.</P>
