<PRE>Mulan  -- A Film Review by Oliver Bollmann
          Nearly Spoilerless</PRE>
<P>Mulan is the latest Full-Length Feature Animated Movie to emerge
from the Disney studios.  Being an avid fan of many Disney movies
(having seen _Lion King_ in the theatres 5 times, etc) I went to
see Mulan on opening night, and again a week later to better
formulate my feeling for this movie.  I will admit, I was really,
really looking forward to this film, and as such, it may have
coloured my final impressions of it.  Looking at recent Disney
films, TLK and then Hunchback both raised the bar in terms of not
only visual style and animation quality, but also the (for the
lack of a better word) matureness of storytelling, the characters
involved and the issues tackled.  In three of cases (BatB, TLK
and H) they were followed by films that were both less than
serious and less successful overall.  It was thus in great
anticipation and hopes that I entered Mulan, to be dazzled by
what I had heard to be the most adult Disney film to date.</P>
<P>If there's a film that better exemplifies the schizophrenia of
the Disney full-length feature animation department, I'm not sure
I know one.  In a word, yes, I am disappointed.  The dichotomy
that stands as the culprit that hurts this film is that it is
torn between being a 'serious' film or being a film like
Hercules.  It is as if there were two factions within the
scriptwriters department that were fighting, each stealing parts
of the script to write it in secret of each other, then returning
it.  The end result is a movie that does not balance the elements
of humour and depth, but instead flip-flops between the two, a
situation that left the movie, for me, far to Hercules and not
enough Mulan.  </P>
<P>Hercules was an amusing, if not great film.  How it invades in
Mulan is seen in the amount of slapstick, caricatures and what I
term 'unnecessary toonage' bits, coupled with the ever-classic
"out-of-context" references and humour that spoil, in my opinion,
what was otherwise building. Rather than a balancing act, it
overwhelms the film, preventing any solid and serious thread from
developing and dampening the good parts of the film.</P>
<P>And good parts do abound in the film as well, do not get me
wrong.  There are some very intense scenes that are quite
advanced for Disney; this is, after all, a war movie.  The
destruction of a village, the murder of guards and for perhaps
the first time, blood is shown (on a major character) as a result
of an injury.  Make no mistake here, behind the farcical facade
there is a serious movie trying to get out.  (Which almost leads
me to speculate if they didn't include so much farce to feel they
would then be justified to show more serious) The scene where
Mulan decides to take her father's place is a wonderfully
powerful sequence.  The solemnness of the burnt-out village, and
the death of the main army.  These are both well-handled where
did the film go wrong?</P>
<P>What may be the reason struck me during the second viewing. 
Mulan is not a character-driven movie, as it should be.  Instead,
it is event-driven.  The characters exist only to move the action
ahead to the next scene, or to the next joke.  Actions or
realizations take a half a second to occur, are dwelled upon for
about 30 more, then zip ahead to what's next.  All Disney films
are short, true, but not all _feel_ short.  Mulan felt brutally
short at its total of 89 minutes.  There is very little sense of
character growth, of character's motivations, of character
continuity.  </P>
<P>Perhaps the greatest victim to this is the Hun leader, who is
presented just enough to give the impression he's a mean SOB, but
who's drive isn't expressed enough to make us want to fear or
loath him.  He's evil, pure and straight, so we can't like him. 
Hmmm.  Scar had the motivation of wanting to take power that he
felt was denied to him.  Gaston wasn't necessarily evil, just
selfish, but BatB takes the time to show us how shallow he is,
how he would protect his ego above all else.  In Mulan, a simple
'because it was there' (literally!) mentality is all that is
offered us to dislike the villain.  Mulan herself also suffers
from the 5 second treatment, whether it be the instant decision
to take her father's place, and her instant realisation later on
what the truer reasons may be behind it.  </P>
<P>Of course, one of the most talked about characters is the ever-
present sidekick, in this case, Mushu.  Mushu does have a twist,
however, compared to most other Disney sidekicks, and in this
case, it is that he himself is on a quest, a quest of redemption. 
In the end, however, this does not really change much in the way
of the behaviour or use of the sidekick.  Make jokes, get
character in trouble most of the time, but be there just in time
to save the day.  (What's worse, btw, is that I found many of the
jokes about posing as a man pretty much standard fare, items that
have been used before and hence, relatively predictable) Mushu
shall forever be compared to the Genie in Aladdin as to who is
the more wild sidekick.  Problem is, wildness isn't what this
film required.</P>
<P>Another aspect that could quite well have been left out is the
songs.  Yes, this is not a new argument by many, dating back many
Disney features now, but with Mulan, the songs just add to
further fragment the already tenuous story thread.  (Unintegrated
might be a good word to invent for this situation)  Only one song
did I find worthwhile, and by no surprise, it was the main-piece
song by Donny Osmond.  The score, on the other paw, is amazing. 
Jerry Goldsmith may not have been as skillful as Hans Zimmer in
integrating various themes and music typologies together, but the
score does flow and flow strong when needed.  The soundtrack is
on my to-get list, and will be gotten by this evening.  </P>
<P>Unsurprisingly, the main beauty for this film comes from the
animation.  Breathtaking in many places, the computer-gurus at
Disney have managed to integrate their wares almost seamlessly
into the main pictures, leading to some very jaw-dropping
visuals.  In the middle realm, we have the use of the computer as
a layout-tool, allowing many more sweeping visuals and
camera/angle changes than have been seen before.  Finally, at the
"hands-on" realm, there are some gorgeous backgrounds created in
a Chinese-watercolour-like style and atmosphere, the quality of
which makes me want to own many of the cells and hang them on my
wall.  Not to be outdone here, though, the warring factions (I
mean those at Disney, not he Huns and the Chinese) pepper the
film with caricatures and odd-balls that serve to firmly root one
in their seat, rather than becoming enveloped in the world being
shown on screen.</P>
<P>In the end, even Mulan isn't able to save herself.  No, instead,
she relies on the help of her trusty sidekick to put her plan in
motion.  A very quick wrap-up, and she is home for the final
indignity, that of having to follow in the lines of all Disney
heroines and have her life made complete by getting the guy. 
(Forget all that stuff about discovering who you are, or having
achieved honour through your actions, hey, the REAL honour is
that now you can get married!)</P>
<P>The premise of Mulan is ripe with opportunities and could very
easily have been the most mature Disney film to date.  I'm not
sure who to 'blame' for the result, but I just wish so badly
they'd continued the drive towards a meatier animated feature. 
To say I dislike Mulan, or that I do not recommend it would be
wrong, as oddly as that might sound after this review.  The harsh
words I type above are there simply because of this burning
disappointment I felt after seeing this movie.  But buried behind
Hercules is the real Mulan, IMHO, and what shows through is
enough to make me believe in this film.  I would never call Mulan
the best Disney film ever made, not even close... but it
certainly isn't the worst Disney film made in recent memory
either.</P>
