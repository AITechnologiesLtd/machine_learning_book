<P>PLOT:
Based on some actual events and a healthy dose of make-believe, this story
takes a behind-the-scenes look at director F.W. Murnau's making of
NOSFERATU. With all of the cast and crew on board, the director brings in an
unknown to play the lead vampire. The man in question likes to remain in
character at all times, and ultimately draws fear from others on the set.
The question now becomes, is he really a vampire or just a method actor
"becoming" the part?</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A film that is sure to appeal to the art-house crowds more than the mass
audiences, this film gives us a super-creepy performance by Willem Dafoe,
some very cool atmosphere, a unique style of direction and an okay story. I
wasn't bowled over by this story because it was difficult for me to come to
grips with the whole reality vs fantasy elements of this movie. I mean, the
film is obviously based on real people, a real movie and a real movie
production, but many of its elements are purely fantasy-based and made up,
so I was sorta left scratching my head at certain points (if you see someone
grab a bat and devour it right in front of you, wouldn't you "kinda" think
that he "might" be a vampire?). I guess I would have rather seen the whole
film made completely as a fantasy or an ED WOOD type scenario, in which all
of the actual events are portrayed, but this point didn't really spoil my
viewing. In fact, I quite enjoyed the movie as a whole, loved the way
Merhige shot the actual scenes in color and then transformed them into black
and white when the "film within the film" began to shoot, and appreciated
the dark and mysterious mood of it all. But I guess that I might've been
expecting a little too much in the first place.</P>
<P>Critic or not, I am but a person, and that definitely happens sometimes,
especially when you've heard about a movie for such a long time, and
anticipate it so. This is the kind of movie that I, or anyone else for that
matter, will likely enjoy more on video or DVD. It's slow-paced and doesn't
really follow any conventional arc of a story, feeling much more like a
documentary based on the possible events of a film production, rather than
an actual film created to entertain. In fact, the film is original in that
sense, since it rarely possesses any real thrills, suspense, romance, humor
or action, but does still manage to keep you interested throughout (well, at
least it did me). I definitely don't think this film will work for everyone,
and it certainly won't work for anyone looking for a horror type of movie,
or a slasher with blood, etc... In fact, this movie barely sheds one drop of
any blood. It's really much more about the ambiguous nature of the lead
character and the full extent that the director is willing to go in order to
get his film made. Does that sound interesting to you? If yes, check the
movie out. If you're not really interested in that aspect of the film, and
don't particularly care to see one of the most bizarre portrayals of a "man"
on screen in the past few years, that would be Willem Dafoe, I'd say skip it
altogether.</P>
<P>I liked it and I certainly look forward to catching it again on DVD real
soon. And if the Academy doesn't toss Dafoe a nomination for this memorable
role, it will all but assure the fact that they're filled with a bunch of
dodos (since we all expect them to diss Christian Bale as well).</P>
