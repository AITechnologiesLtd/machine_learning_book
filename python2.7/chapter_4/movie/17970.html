Susan Granger's review of "LOST & FOUND" (Warner Bros.)</PRE>
<P>       David Spade is a "Saturday Night Live" alumnus who survived
"Black Sheep" and is now on TV's "Just Shoot Me."  In this movie,
however, he's a cloying wimp who's better doing what he knows how to
do - sketch comedy - than what he doesn't. Meaning - he can do a
wickedly clever caricature of Neil Diamond but developing a
fully-fleshed character is beyond his grasp. In this lame, derivative
romantic comedy, which he co-wrote with J.B. Cook and Mark Meeks,
Spade plays a snide, smug, wise-cracking restaurant owner who attempts
to woo his dream-girl neighbor, a beautiful French cellist, Sophie
Marceau, by stealing her cairn terrier and then pretending to find the
hapless animal when she thinks he's lost. Of course, his plan is
somewhat foiled when her obnoxious ex-boyfriend (Patrick Bruel) flies
in from Paris to help with the search and Jon Lovitz is summoned as a
"dog whisperer," who senses the pooch's pain and recommends pampering.
There's a tasteless sub-plot that revolves around Spade's partner's
diamond anniversary ring that's swallowed by the dog and his frantic
determination to be there when it comes out the other end. As a
result, there are lots of poop jokes. Directed by Jeff Pollack, Sophie
Marceau shows some deft comic timing in her pink lingerie but Spade is
all attitude and grin, nothing more, which leaves a lot to be
desired. Estelle Harris ("Seinfeld's" Mrs. Costanza) does a cute
comedy bit with some lascivious elderly poker players. On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Lost & Found" is a cheesy 3. It's a geeky TV
sit-com that never should have made it to the big screen.</P>
