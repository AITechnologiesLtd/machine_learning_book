<PRE>THE AVENGERS
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>With Hollywood's fascination with television series remakes, it is
surprising that no one has tackled The Avengers before.  The comically
cool spy adventure series seems like just the type of "franchise"
material usually sought by the studios.  However, franchise hopes are
likely to fade with the premiere of this awkward adaptation.</P>
<P>The Avengers for this big screen adaptation are the prim and proper John
Steed (Ralph Fiennes), who's as impeccable in his manners as he is
deadly in his combat. And then there's the brilliant, seductive and
dangerous Mrs. Emma Peel (Uma Thurman).</P>
<P>The film chronicles the meeting of the two Avengers.  Mr. Steed is
already part of the Ministry, a top secret British spy organization.
When England's weather-defense systems are sabotaged, Mrs. Peel is the
chief expert, and also the chief suspect in the crime.  She is paired up
with Steed to prove her guilt or innocence.</P>
<P>The villain in the film is played with relish by Sean Connery.  He
finally gets to play a Bond-ish villain in Sir August DeWynter, a
megalomaniacal Scottish lord with designs on controlling the weather.</P>
<P>Anyone familiar with The Avengers should know that the show had a
particular brand of humor, but the proceedings in the film are extremely
tongue-in-cheek, and at times get downright silly.  For instance, the
traditional villain-to-henchmen speech for anonymity's sake is here
played with all participants in giant teddy bear costumes.  It doesn't
make much sense, and the goofy antics are certain to displease anyone
expecting a straightforward adventure story.</P>
<P>The film seriously suffers from some horrendous editing.  Clocking in at
under ninety minutes, it seems that most of the expository material has
been cut, as well as many transitions.  The result is certainly fast
moving, but confusing and off-putting as well.</P>
<P>In the plus column, however, are the main actors.  All are guilty of
slightly (but appropriate) hammy acting, but they all seem to fit nicely
into their roles as well.  The supporting cast don't quite fare as well.
As leaders of The Ministry, Jim Broadbent and Fiona Shaw never quite
settle into their roles.  Eddie Izzard is never fully developed as Sir
August's Clockwork Orangish henchman.</P>
<P>There are plenty of moments in The Avengers which have a delightfully
surreal quality.  However, there are just as many scenes which go a bit
too far in their outlandishness.  At the same time, some very crucial
plot points breeze by, imperceptible in the clutter.</P>
<P>The Avengers is likely a little too bizarre for those expecting the
standard spy adventure.  It's not a horrible adaptation, but definitely
a flawed one.</P>
