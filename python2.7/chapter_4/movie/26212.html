<P>     Quick.how funny is this:  "Fish or get off the pot."  Or "Grab the 
bull by the tail and look him in the eye."  Or "Don't just sit there 
like a sore thumb."  Or "Do you think I've got an ace up my hole?"  
Or.or..</P>
<P>     Now imagine them multiplied a thousand-fold.  Imagine a new one 
every time the title character opens her mouth, a mouth filled with gum 
and a painfully off-the-mark Chicago accent.  It's like spending the 
holidays with your wiseacre brother-in-law who thinks he should have 
been a professional comedian.  Worse than that.  It's like spending two 
hours in an Alan Rudolph movie. </P>
<P>     Emily Watson, an actress with a previously sparkling resume' 
("Breaking the Waves", "Hilary and Jackie") but a shallow track record 
at comedy, is the eponymous Trixie, and the fall girl for Rudolph's 
embarrassing go at what he calls "screwball noir".   She's a security 
guard who gets a job undercover at a casino spotting pickpockets, and 
comes to think of herself as a "private defective".  There she falls for 
Dex (Dermot Mulroney), a two-bit Lothario who works for a scumbag 
building contractor (Will Patton), and gets mixed up in trying to solve 
the murder of a lounge singer (Leslie Anne Warren) who is the mistress 
of a state senator (Nick Nolte). </P>
<P>     It's hard to tell what Trixie's main interest is - solving crime or 
mangling the language.  Her relentless torrentof malapropisms could only 
be intentional, but she delivers them with a stonefaced determination 
that spreads a leaden pall over any spark that might ignite the story.  
Come to think of it, there is no such spark, and no story.  There are, 
however, a few game performances.  Nolte works hard as the obfuscating 
legislator with a mouthful of political platitudes, though Rudolph's 
determined lack of writing, pacing, and editorial sense leaves him high 
and dry, especially in a long, long restaurant scene that goes nowhere.  
Almost rising above the mess is Nathan Lane as a stand-up comic who does 
nifty impressions in his casino lounge act. </P>
<P>     Alan Rudolph is a miracle of modern cinema.  Backed by his 
producer/mentor Robert Altman, he has put out a numbing string of movies 
over the years without ever resorting to talent.  It may be time to put 
him together with Keanu Reeves and see what magic they can make 
together.   </P>
