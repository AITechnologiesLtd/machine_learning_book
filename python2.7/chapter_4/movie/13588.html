<PRE>Review: 12 Angry Men (1997)</PRE>
<P>Starring: Jack Lemmon, George C. Scott, Tony Danza, Edward James Olmos,
Ossie Davis, Hume Cronyn, Mykelti Williamson, Courtney B. Vance, Armin
Mueller Stahl, James Gandolfini, William Peterson</P>
<PRE>Directed by William Friedkin</PRE>
<P>In 1957, a young man by the name of Sidney Lumet ventured into the world
of feature film directing with 12 Angry Men, a taught and involving
drama about the events that unfold while a jury of a dozen men from
different worlds delibertate in a murder trial.</P>
<P>40 years later, a second attempt at the film is made, and the only
question this viewer could manage was `why?'</P>
<P>William Friedkin, no doubt one of the finer directors around assembled
one of the most impressive casts in modern-day movie history,
particularly when you consider that this movie was made for HBO. But the
rehearsal for these fine men was obviously to watch the film that came
before it. Each somehow manages to give sub-par performances that look
like lame regurgitations of thier thespian colleagues' work of 40 years
earlier. </P>
<P>In 1957, Sidney Lumet worked with Boris Kauffman, one of B&W cinema's
finest cinematographers, to develop a `style' for the film. As the tense
afternoon turned into evening, the room seemed tighter, and the lenses
changed. The camera was tighter on each character as we got deeper
inside their heads. Each character had his own motivation which was
beautifully conveyed. Here, Friedkin picks a seemingly arbitrary camera
plot, one in which the frame is either at some funky dutch angle or
rather a jerky steady-cam. (In a confined space?)</P>
<P>Another fault of the modern-day remake is the dialogue. As great as it
is, the banter worked better when taken in context. This was written
nearly 50 years ago, and the expressions sound like it. But the script
is redone ver batim, though a few brief dialogue scenes are added, and
none of them need to be. James Gandolfini asks Mykelti Williamson if he
was a `Nation of Islam guy'. Courtney B. Vance `modernizes' his story
about coaching a league championship football game in the rain, and then
starts to cry. A few jurors talk behind other's backs while in the
restroom. But none of it means anything. Each actor re-performs the work
of another great actor, only it is blatantly obvious.</P>
<P>The original film dealt with a cultural problem that is no longer an
issue today. There were no black men on the jury in the original, and in
the remake there are four. Mykelti Williamson is the oddest choice to
play juror number ten, and his character is the most changed from the
original. The juror is a bitter racist, but Williamson plays him that
way. He talks of latino's as lesser people and talks about scum from the
ghetto, while he doesn't make any attempt to hide his urban slang, nor
does he hide the fact that he is a mechanic. When Ed Beagly played the
role, it was very fitting that he was a white racist, but Williamson's
re-invented character is just a mystery here. His extreme hatred and
ignorance really takes away the power of the group dynamic. When the
climax is reached, it is now very unsatisfying, because of how
dominating his character was. The story really ends with juror number
three, and the transformation he makes. But because of Williamson's new
edge (no fault of the actor) he becomes the focal point, though he is
not involved in the climax.</P>
<P>The best thing HBO could have done last year would have been to put the
money from this budget into digitaly re-mastering the original film and
presenting it in widescreen format. It would have been fitting, since it
was the film's 40th anniversary. Instead, a boatload of talent is wasted
on one of the most completley pointless remakes of all time. Lemmon
can't outdo his old friend Fonda. Williamson's character is way over the
top and even the Great Scott can't perform with the power that Lee J.
Cobb could. (Though Danza gives Warden a run for his money in a
surprisingly good performance.) Rent 12 Angry Men 1997 ONLY if you've
seen the original masterpiece and want to compare.</P>
