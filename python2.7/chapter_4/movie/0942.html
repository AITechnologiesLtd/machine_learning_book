<PRE>                            DANCES WITH WOLVES
                       A film review by Laurie Mann
                        Copyright 1991 Laurie Mann</PRE>
<P>     I'm not a Western fan at all, but when I first saw the trailer for
DANCES WITh WOLVES last fall, I knew I'd go see it.  The photography in
the movie is absolutely gorgeous.  Kevin Coster and the team that
photographed the movie did a magnificent job.</P>
<P>     The story is very simple on the surface.  A Union soldier asks to
be posted to the frontier after he accidentally becomes a hero after
being wounded in a battle.  Dunbar (Costner) wants to see the frontier
before it becomes shopping malls, and I can't say I blame him. (:-))  He
wants to see buffaloes.  His post turns out to be a deserted sod hut on
the prairie.  He's alone, and while he wonders why his relief never
shows up, he enjoys his solitude.</P>
<P>     Eventually, the local Indians find him, and they learn to trust one
another.  Communication between them is quite difficult, but it is made
a little easier when a white woman who has lived with the Indians since
her childhood agrees to "make the white man's talk."  The woman, Stands
with Fist, is portrayed by Mary McDonell.  The Indian holy man, Kicking
Bird, is portrayed by Graham Greene.  Greene gives a wonderful
performance, and McDonell's is a little more tentative (though so is her
character).</P>
<P>     Gradually, Dunbar spends more and more time with the Indians.  In
the movie's highlight, he joins them on a buffalo hunt which is a
magnificently photographed sequence.  Costner deserves enormous credit
in pulling that one off.</P>
<P>     Most of the movie is quite subtle and understated.  The photography
is the real star, the long shots of the prairie.  So when reality
"intrudes" about a half hour before the ending of the film, it's
jarring.  I suspect the people who gripe about revisionism in the movie
are complaining about this portion of the film.  The movie is quite long
and leisurely but never boring.  It also feels quite realistic until the
ending.</P>
<P>     While I still think AWAKENINGS was the best movie of last year,
DANCES WITH WOLVES is so strong for so long that it comes close to being
a great movie.  For a first directorial effort, Costner deserves an A.</P>
<P>     Aside from the ending, the Barry score is the film's other major
weakness.  John Barry hasn't written an original score in many years.
He wrote a nice military piece that's used in the beginning, but isn't
used for the rest of the movie.  Barry's score is okay, and it suits the
movie, but it isn't at all original.  If you've seen KING KONG [the
remake -Moderator] or OUT OF AFRICA or MOONRAKER, you've heard the score
already.</P>
<P>     This movie is an 8 on the Chuck scale.  I think it will win Best
Picture, Best Actor, and Best Cinematography.</P>
