<PRE>THIS YEAR'S LOVE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>So many characters, so little time.  In writer/director David Kane's
THIS YEAR'S LOVE, Danny (Douglas Henshall) dumps his wife of 35 minutes,
Hannah (Catherine McCormack, the star of DANGEROUS BEAUTY), after it
comes to his attention that she has recently slept with his Best Man.</P>
<P>This event sets off a chain reaction which causes them and many other
characters to play a game of musical beds, not surprising in a movie in
which shallowness rules.  Obviously incompatible characters form quickie
relationships based mainly on coincidence and convenience.</P>
<P>Besides Danny and Hannah, the other human couplers include: Sophie
(Jennifer Ehle from WILDE), a 30-year-old single mom with a penchant for
abusive partners, Cameron (Dougray Scott), a bad painter who washes his
hair every few months, Liam (Ian Hart), a wimpy comic book dealer, and
Marey (Kathy Burke), an airport janitor and band singer.</P>
<P>Marey, as the anti-model, is the least likely character of all.  Plump
and completely unattractive, she can't understand why handsome men would
rather date her than the gorgeous women to which they are accustomed.
Neither will you.  One character claims it is because of her sense of
humor, but the script gives her little funny to do or say.</P>
<P>Kane falls back on the usual assortment of romantic comedy clichés.
Drunken women pass out or throw up at the most inopportune moments.  And
sober characters trying to engage in sexual activities fall into the
furniture and each other in slapstick routines worthy of vaudeville.</P>
<P>Although the performances are pleasant enough, the problem with the film
is that we've seen it all many times before.  THIS YEAR'S LOVE can best
be thought of as a dumbed down FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL.</P>
<P>THIS YEAR'S LOVE runs 1:48.  It is not yet rated but will undoubtedly be
an R for sex, drug usage and language.  The film would be acceptable for
older teenagers.</P>
<P>The film will be playing as part of the San Francisco International Film
Festival (<A HREF="http://www.sfiff.org">http://www.sfiff.org</A>), which runs April 20 to May 4, 2000.  It
does not currently have a United States release date.</P>
