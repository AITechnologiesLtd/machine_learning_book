<PRE>NOTHING TO LOSE (1997)
STARS TIM ROBBINS AND MARTIN LAWRENCE
A TOUCHSTONE RELEASE
A REVIEW BY DAVID WILCOCK
(C)1997 DAVID WILCOCK</PRE>
<P>Tim Robbins and Martin Lawernce team up in this road
movie comedy. Robbins plays an exec who discovers his
wife having sex with his boss. He goes into depression, and
drives around his neighbourhood until he arrives inside the
usual 'ghetto' side of every American city. There,
Lawernce attempts to steal his car, but to no avail, and is
dragged along with Robbin's on a trip to Arizona. There,
they hold up a store, are mistaken for two other robbers
(just like in My Cousin Vinny) and are chased by the
police, and the other robbers. Of course, there's gags along
the way, usually from Lawernce. </P>
<P>Although the film is midly funny, and quite watchable,
there's something so horribly familiar about it all. This
film should really be called Beverly Hills Midnight Run
There's Lawernce with his wisecracking and heavy
profanity, just like Eddie Murphy in Beverly Hills Cop,
and pratically the same idea as Midnight Run. It's full of all
the road movie cliches, and even has a 'comedy' car chase,
which just seemed so eighties. Even the credit sequence
seemed to be out of a Steve Martin, or Chevy Chase,
eighties comedy. </P>
<P>There also isn't much chemistry between Robbins and
Lawernce. In PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES,
there was real chemistry between Steve Martin and John
Candy. In NOTHING TO LOSE, there is hardly
chemistry at all. Towards the end the chemistry seems to
work, but for the bulk of the film, there is hardly any, </P>
<P>The director directs the film in a workman like fashion, but
gets the jokes across. And although there is no chemistry
between the two leads, they give good performances on
their own. Lawerence gives a good Eddie Murphy
performance, and Robbin's is alright aswell. However,
Robbin's performance is nowhere near as good as the
characters he played in JACOB'S LADDER, and THE
PLAYER. In fact, if you want to see Robbin's do comedy
much better than in NOTHING TO LOSE, I suggest you
rent out THE HUDSUCKER PROXY, where he is much
funnier. </P>
<P>NOTHING TO LOSE does have some funny moments in
it, however. The humour isn't particulary sophisticated, but
if you enojyed DUMB & DUMBER, you might enjoy this.
The characters in Arizona are funny, and there's also a
good scene where Robbin's asks a shopkeeper which
'threatening approach' was better, Lawerences (which
consisted of Lawerence threatening to shoot the
shopkeeper's ass, and swearing a lot), or himselfs, (which
was speaking in a deep, scary voice) But the gags are
predictable, the lack of chemistry infurating, and the
ending too far-fetched and 'perfect' </P>
<P>NOTHING TO LOSE then, is Robbin's first 'bad' movie
(and hopefully his last), and suggests that Odereick should
twice before making another film. He nearly ruined
Carrey's career with ACE VENTURA: WHEN NATURE
CALLS, let's hope he hasn't ruined Robbin's (or even
Lawerence's) with NOTHING TO LOSE. </P>
