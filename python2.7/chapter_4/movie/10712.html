<PRE>THE MALTESE FALCON (1941)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: John Huston
Writer: John Huston (from the novel by Dashiell Hamet)
Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor, Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre,
Elisha Cook Jr, Jerome Cowan, Gladys George, Barton MacLane, Lee
Patrick, Ward Bond, Walter Huston</P>
<P>There are a few perfect films in their own respects that have been made
in cinema.  This is one of them.  "The Maltese Falcon" gets my vote for
the greatest piece of American film noir, simply because everything
about it is so flawless.  Filled with twists and turns which are
plausible and amazing, intriguing characters from all sides, and a story
which is never boring, "The Maltese Falcon" actually improves upon each
viewing.  They just don't make films like this anymore.</P>
<P>"The Maltese Falcon"'s labyrinthine plot revolves around the least
amoral and most intelligent character in the story: detective Sam Spade
(Humphrey Bogart), half of the detective office of "Spade and Archer." 
One day, a woman named Miss Wonderly (Mary Astor) comes in, asking them
to find her sister who has been stolen from her by a man named Floyd
Thursby.  When Archer (Jerome Cowan) tails him that night, he is shot by
point blank by someone.  Only minutes later, Thursby is also shot in the
back four times.</P>
<P>Not only out to clear his name since the cops think he shot one or both
of them, but also to get vengeance for his partner, Sam begins to do
some more investigating, and discovers that Thursby was thought to have
in his posession an antique "malteese falcon," which is worth millions. 
Also, Miss Wonderly is revealed to be a liar who's real name is Brigid
O'Shaughnessey, but whether she killed either of them is still
questionable.</P>
<P>As the plot slowly unfolds, we are introduced to a trio of more unshady
characters, all out to find the falcon: Joel Cairo (the great Peter
Lorre), an aquaintance of Thursby's who uses some witless tactics to
search Sam for the bid; Kasper Gutman (Philip Greenstreet), who's last
name describes his shape, and a rich man seeking the bird for years, and
willing to do anything to get it; and Wilmer Cook (Elisha Cook Jr.),
Gutman's dim-witted hitman who makes a name for himself inconspicuously
tailing Sam throughout the first half of the film.</P>
<P>The film has a brilliant plot, devoid of plot holes, implausibility, and
genuine stupidity, but is only secondary to the characters.  This is how
film noir should work: the plot is fueled by the characters within it. 
None of these characters are trapped by a gimmick, or by a plot which
needs to go only one place.  Even the romance between Sam and Brigid is
intelligently done, opening up whole new dimensions in the story.  And
the plot isn't just about who will get the bird; it's about who's smart
enough to get it.</P>
<P>The film also sometimes feels like a play, posessing a lot of the
intensity of watching live action occur.  On my third viewing of the
film, I timed the final scene at around 27 minutes, and in that scene,
we get a continuation of the story, as well as a wrap up.  The way this
scene is done, with very few cuts, is one of the most intense scenes in
cinema, as you're watching the end unfold mysteriously.  One of the best
things about this film is because it is character motivated, you don't
always know where the plot is going to go, and this allows every future
second to appear like a blind gaze.  In this scene, which is long, we
get tension purely because it is so superficially contained, and it's
one of the best scenes in all of Hollywood history.</P>
<P>The script is also amazing, as it is rumored to be word-for-word from
the novel it was adapted from (novel by Dashiell Hamet; script by
director John Huston).  The dialogue these people have are incredibly
deft, and create well-drawn characters.  There are numerous memorable
scenes consisting of just dialogue that moves the action around,
including the end, and a brilliantly done scene between Sam and Gutman,
when they first meet.  There are also some of the great lines that would
become Bogie staples, like my personal favorite, "When you're slapped,
you'll take it and like it!"</P>
<P>And the acting from everyone is incredible, as their characters are
written amazingly.  Elisha Cook Jr nails his role as the dim-witted
Wilmer, especially in the long final scene.  Peter Lorre gives a
memorable performance as Cairo, who has one of the coolest sounding
voices in history (which was later an influence for the cartoon
character, Ren - Lorre even gets a chance to yell at Gutman "You bloated
idiot!").  Sidney Greenstreet is incredible as Gutman, playing his
intelligent character appropriately cool, yet with undertones of
scariness.  And Astor plays her role so well that even I was as confused
to her innocence as Sam was.</P>
<P>And, of course, there's Bogie.  Humphrey gives one of his best if not
his best performance of his career as the anti-hero Sam Spade, a lonor
with a personal code of ethics which deems that he investigate the case
further.  Every scene he's in, he nails his character fully, embodying
him completely.  Every move he makes, and every piece of dialogue he
utters is his that of Sam Spade.  Not many people can embody a character
in a film this well, but Bogie can do it.</P>
<P>The direction by John Huston (in his first directing of a film) is
incredible.  He paces everything perfectly, and has written a highly
intelligent script which never loses the audience or insults their
intelligence.  Every single character is well-defined, and every twist,
turn, back-stabbing, is plausible and shocking simultaneously.  This is
a film where it is almost impossible to be bored at, and definitely
impossible to not be thrilled by.</P>
<P>Film noir is always a hard thing to do, but when every element is
balanced correctly, when everything comes together effortlessly, you
have a gem on your hands.  "The Maltese Falcon" is the best film noir
I've ever seen - better than "Chinatown" and the recent "L.A.
Confidential" (also better than the recent "Jackie Brown," which also
has great characterization).  By creating a world where the selfish and
cruel can abound by trying to screw eachother over, "The Maltese Falcon"
suceeds in thrilling an audience on simple pleasures, and coming off as
one of the most memorable and greatest films of all time.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ****</PRE>
