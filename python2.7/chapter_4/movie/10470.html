<P>    I don't know a single person that doesn't think that Woody Allen is
annoying. I, myself, am one of those
people. I think he is intensely annoying. I watch him jitter and shake
around the screen, spewing
half-sentences like a broken verbal machine gun, with those black little
eyes magnified behind those
ridiculously thick glasses, and I wonder why I repeatedly go to see the
films that he writes, directs, and
stars in. It doesn't take me long to figure it out--he's really funny.
That's usually what it comes down to.
Maybe the character he plays isn't always really funny, but his
supporting characters are so funny, and the
situations are absolutely hilarious.</P>
<P>    Deconstructing Harry is his latest film, and I imagine that to
obtain complete enjoyment, one should know
Woody Allen pretty well. I, for one, do not--I have not seen a lot of
his films (I think this marks the fourth
or fifth), and what I know of him outside of his work is just what I
read in the tabloids and Entertainment
Weekly. But I know that this film is one big stab at himself, and I can
assume that it is successful. But like
most of his films, this one is successful because of the numerous
interesting characters, and the witty,
sharp, Woody Allen humor. What this film seems to have that his others
do not is a jagged edge, a kind of
licentious and hateful quality, an element present simply to make more
fun of himself.</P>
<P>    It's about Harry Block (Allen), a godless, sex-crazed author who, at
the time of the film, is in complete
disarray. He's just written a book that gives up the secrets of some of
his closest friends and ex-girlfriends,
and none of them are particularly happy with the situation. He's never
allowed to see his kid, his parents
have all but disowned him, his sister and her husband look down upon him
because he isn't a true Jewish
man, and so forth. On top of all this, he can't get motivated to write
anything significant, so his life is on
hold.</P>
<P>    The film is kind of a journey for Harry to understand himself, or
maybe make himself better, should he
reach the point of caring about himself. It leads to a situation in
which he's driving in a Volvo with a
hooker and a corpse, on his way to get honored by the school which
expelled him. Like all of Allen's
films, he has a huge cast. It's nearly distractingly large, with almost
every part filled up by a big-name star.
Most of the women turn in the best performances, with genuinely funny
moments delivered by Judy Davis,
Kirstie Alley, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Demi Moore. If you're familiar
with Allen's films, then you'll know
what to expect--it's the same kind of humor, pacing, and mood to which
we're all accustomed in his
movies.</P>
<P>    This one, however, seems to suffer from a peculiar storytelling
technique. Because of the nature of the
story, Harry frequently relives pieces of short stories that he has
written; most of them star a guy thinly
disguised as himself, and tells a true story. He remembers one of the
first stories he wrote, about his first
encounter with a prostitute. Another story he remembers is one in which
he goes to hell to save the woman
he loves. Throughout the film, the action also switches to a different
cast doing the exact same thing,
which is meant to represent the book which he has just written (the one
that everyone is upset at him for).
If my explanation of this is confusing, then I'm doing my job--it is
also rather confusing in the film. I didn't
put the pieces together until the last quarter of the movie. It's really
not that obvious, nor is Allen's reason
for doing it (though I imagine if you're familiar with all of his work
then there is something here to give you
a hint). The flashbacks sure are funny, though.</P>
<P>    Towards the end, he actually meets the character that he created,
his alter-ego, and this individual gives
Harry all kinds of advice. I like the idea (look into your writing for
advice), and the central idea behind his
character--he can function in the artistic world but not in the
realistic world--is a fascinating one.
Ultimately, the film aside from the comedy works because Allen really
thought about his concepts and
materialized them effectively (although the flashbacks to his stories
could have been less confusing).
Whether you love him or hate him, you're likely to enjoy Deconstructing
Harry. And if you know Allen
really well, you'll probably get a lot more out of the film. As for me,
it proved to make a worthwhile
evening of entertainment, even if though is about a godless, sex-crazed
author in complete disarray.</P>
