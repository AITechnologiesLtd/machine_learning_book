<P>With his first two films, "In the Company of Men" and "Your Friends &
Neighbors," writer/director Neil LaBute explored corporate and sexual
politics with a searing eye that thrilled many viewers, while sending
others racing for the exits. This time around, Fort Wayne, Indiana's
most noted provocateur ventures a little closer to the mainstream,
albeit a mainstream with some choppy waters and the occasional acidic
eddy.</P>
<P>"Nurse Betty" is a skewed fairy tale, a loopy road movie that shifts in
tone from whimsical to soothing to shocking and back again. With a
(mostly) crackerjack cast and a plot that zags every time you expect it
to zig, the production is a welcome relief after weeks and weeks of
lousy flicks.</P>
<P>The story, which earned John C. Richards and James Flamberg a Best
Screenplay award at this year's Cannes Film Festival, chronicles a
pivotal period in the life of Betty (Renee Zellweger), a coffee shop
waitress and ardent soap opera fan in Fair Oaks, Kansas. Although her
smarmy car-salesman husband, Del (Aaron Eckhart), has forgotten her
birthday, Betty plans to celebrate in style, borrowing a car from her
hubby's lot for a night on the town with a girlfriend.</P>
<P>But matters go terribly wrong. After watching a tape of her favorite
serial, "A Reason to Love," and swooning when the show's most popular
character, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear) intones "I know there's
someone special out there for me," Betty glances into her living room
and witnesses a horrific sight. Husband Del is frantically negotiating
with hit men Charlie (Morgan Freeman) and Wesley (Chris Rock), when an
ugly exchange leads his being scalped and then shot to death (sensitive
viewers should be ready to avert their eyes several times during the
film). The shock throws Betty into a fugue state, marked by a
combination of amnesia and physical fright. The suddenly psychotic
woman, who always dreamed of being a nurse, hops into the 1997 Buick
LaSabre and heads towards Los Angeles for a romantic "reunion" with her
beloved Dr. Ravell.</P>
<P>Among the many things Betty doesn't know is that the car's trunk holds
the very cache of drugs that prompted Del's visit from the hit men.
Charlie and Wesley set out after Betty, determined to recover the
narcotics and wipe out the witness to their work.</P>
<P>"Nurse Betty" is one of those rare films able to reference numerous
other movies ("The Wizard of Oz," "Thelma and Louise" "The Purple Rose
of Cairo," "Being There" and "Pulp Fiction," to name but a few), while
still feeling like a true original. LaBute, whose previous movies were
marked by inventive, but minimalist camera movements, proves adroit at
fluid filmmaking. As always, he brings out the best from his performers.</P>
<P>Renee Zellweger, so terrific in "Jerry Maguire," does her best work to
date here, making a remarkably smooth transition from sweet, mousy
housewife to whacked-out adventurer. But her best moments come when the
fugue state cracks, plunging the woman into an alien reality. Despite
her massive, understandable confusion, she displays a grand air of
strength and personal resolve while sorting things out.</P>
<P>Morgan Freeman is equally impressive as senior hit man Charlie. Freeman,
one of the best actors working today, creates a complex persona that
somehow manages to remain sympathetic despite his deadly occupation.
Greg Kinnear is solid and likable in the dual roles of a soap opera
character and a "real life" actor, while the wonderful Allison Janney
gracefully steals scenes as the producer of "A Reason to Love."</P>
<P>On the down side, Aaron Eckhart is wasted in a brief, cartoonish turn as
Betty's piggish husband. Eckhart, who starred in both of LaBute's other
films and won a wide audience as Julia Roberts' boyfriend in "Erin
Brokovich," deserves more than a glorified cameo appearance. And then
there's Chris Rock. Yes, I know he has legions of fans. Yes, his
abrasive behavior fits that of junior assassin Wesley. But Rock's loud,
whiny style is pure, fingernails-on-the-blackboard annoying to me. I
look forward to the day when he becomes seasoned enough to deliver his
high quality jokes in a less screechy fashion.</P>
<P>Still, "Nurse Betty" is a corker. The highlight of the film is
unquestionably Betty's cocktail party exchange with key members of "A
Reason to Love," where her psychosis is mistaken as a Method Acting
audition, but what happens soon after is even more admirable. I won't
spoil it for you. Suffice to say that the screenwriters recognized the
perfect moment for Betty's fugue state to end, allowing her journey to
move from fantasy to substance. Following a summer where most film
characters were depicted spinning in circles, it's gratifying to watch
someone grow as a person. It's gratifying to watch the enormously gifted
Neil Labute's filmmaking growth as well.</P>
