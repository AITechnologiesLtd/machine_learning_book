<PRE>                             BEVERLY HILLS COP 3
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     I went into the third installment of Eddie Murphy's BEVERLY HILLS
COP saga with very low expectations, but I must admit that it was
better than I expected, I had a few good laughs, and it was nice
diversion.  On the other hand, I can not recommend it.</P>
<P>     There are some funny scenes.  Bronson Pinchot from the first
BEVERLY HILLS COP is back again with a small part.  This time he is
running a weapons boutique rather than an art gallery.  Pinchot's
boutique features the 3 Ps (protection, prestige, and pretty) and has
the slogan "why should you look ugly when you are trying to survive".
Pinchot's machine gun, CD player, TV, and microwave oven combination
and how Murphy uses it is the only really hilarious scene in the show.</P>
<P>     So what was wrong with it?  The director, John Landis, and lack of
energy.  I keep wanting to tell Murphy to go get some caffeine - lots
of it.  It was as if this was BEVERLY HILLS COP 15 and Eddie was now 80
years old playing Axel Foley one last time before Murphy retired from
acting.  There are some scenes in the show where Murphy is his old self
again, and they are excellent.  The director's pacing, the editing
(Dale Beldin), and the way the director had Murphy playing the role
were all sad.</P>
<P>     BEVERLY HILLS COP 3 runs long at 1:44.  It is rated R for bloody
violence and filthy language.  I guess it would be okay for teenagers.
I give the movie * 1/2 as they were some good parts, and I managed to
have an enjoyable time waiting for Murphy to wake up periodically and
act.</P>
<P>     Now for three pieces of trivia.  First, my whole family is in the
movie.  90% of it is set in Great America (called Wonderworld in the
movie).  We were there when they were filming the scene on the triple
looper ride (beats me what it is called).  If you look very carefully,
you can see 3 ants way down on the ground.  We ARE those ants!  We
could not see us, but I know we are there.  I will see us when I freeze
frame that laser disc next year.  Maybe you can find us.  Prizes are
possible to the first reported sighting.</P>
<P>     Second, they added many rides to Great America to make it look
more like an amusement park, and it was made by the people, Paramount,
that own the park!  It was fun the day we were there seeing all of the
imported rides that were used only in the movie.  A couple of the
fictional rides, I really wish they had.  The dinosaur ride looked
especially neat.</P>
<P>     Third, I have had dinner three times with Bronson Pinchot.  We
were staying on a remote Caribbean Island (Young Island off St.
Vincent) in 1986, and he was there by himself.  He was really funny in
person but kind of lonely.  One of his best stories was about the
filming of THE FLAMINGO KID.  It was set at a posh Long Island resort
in the summer.  Actually, to get the place, they had to film it all in
Long Island in November.  They nearly froze to death in their swimming
suits.  They had gofers on the set whose sole job was to hold big
towels around the stars until the director yelled action and then they
let them loose.  Because of the wind noise they had to dub most of the
speech later.  This was a problem because their speech pitch was
accentuated due to the cold and so they had trouble dubbing their own
words later.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
