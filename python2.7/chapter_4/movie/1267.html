<PRE>                             MISSISSIPPI MASALA
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1992 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     MISSISSIPPI MASALA is a film by Mira Nair.  The script was written
by Sooni Toraparevala.  The film stars Denzel Washington, Roshan Seth,
Sarita Choudhury, Sharmila Tagore.  It is rated R for sexual situations.</P>
<P>     MISSISSIPPI MASALA is the creation of the same director who gave us
SALAAM BOMBAY! (1988), one of my favorite films of all time.  MASALA
does not have the visceral impact as the film about Bombay's street
kids, but it does have the same sweetness and affection for its
characters.  This film is a variation on Romeo and Juliet, for all
intents and purposes, wherein the opposing families are
African-Americans and transplanted African-Indians, coexisting in
Greenwood, Mississippi, superficially peaceful until Demetrius (Denzel
Washington), the self-starter with his own carpet-cleaning business,
crosses the invisible line and finds himself in a situation with the
dark-skinned Mina.  Mina (Sarita Choudhury) is the 24-year-old daughter
of a former lawyer (Roshan Seth) who is consumed with getting back his
Ugandan citizenship, lost when Idi Amin expelled all the Indians in his
country in 1972.  Her mother (Sharmila Tagore) runs a liquor store and
tries to run Mina's life and marry her off to slightly slimey Hari.  </P>
<P>     Like EUROPA, EUROPA, another film about racism and displacement, 
MASALA is concerned first with the characters' quest for identity, for
finding a place that is home.  The Indians seem to take India with them
whether they are in Kampala or Greenwood (Mina herself has never been to
India).  The Indians, especially a trio of men, seem to be somewhat
stock characters, figures of satire, on whom little love is wasted; the
most sympathetic of the three is played by Ranjit Chowdry (LONELY IN
AMERICA, 1991) as a motel owner.  The black characters are treated
overall more affectionately.  However, it is Nair's skill with the major
actors that makes MASALA worthy of your attention.  Certainly the story
itself is familiar and predictable.</P>
<P>     Denzel Washington is just as charming and handsome as ever,
obviously having a great time playing a homeboy.  Sarita Choudhury is
innocently sensual, fiercely determined to become her own person; the
actress grew up in Jamaica--look for her Bob Marley T-shirt.  Sharmila
Tagore, a regular in the films of Indian master Satyajit Ray, is
strong-willed, loving, frightened for her daughter and her husband, the
sole support of the family while the father is lost in his dreams of
return.  He is played by Roshan Seth, who played Nehru in GANDHI (1982);
he is deeply sympathetic, and infuriating at the same time.  It is his
personal discoveries that are the backbone of the movie.  </P>
<P>     MISSISSIPPI MASALA (masala is explained in the movie as being mixed
up, like spices) satirizes the rivalries of two oppressed races in the
former heartland of racial oppression.  It says racial bigotry is not
only irrational, but doomed to die.  The final scene, at Entebbe
Airport, involving Seth and an black African baby is deeply moving and
emotional, a symbol that passes beyond explication and says it all at
the same time.</P>
<PRE>     I recommend MISSISSIPPI MASALA to you at whatever price you need to
pay.</PRE>
