DR. T AND THE WOMEN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Robert Altman's DR. T AND THE WOMEN is an excessively cute type of story 
in which much is made of the sales clerk at Tiffany's having the name 
Tiffany, and in which one of the characters named Bree (Helen Hunt) 
keeps pointing out that her name isn't like the cheese but like "breed" 
without the "d."</P>
<P>In a sea of women patients as raucously noisy as Grand Central Station 
at rush hour, their Ob-Gyn, Dr. T (Richard Gere), reigns supreme.  A 
dozen noisy "fillies" wait for him while gabbing a mile-a-minute.  Most 
are ostentatiously wealthy women with long blonde hair.  It's the sort 
of office in which a patient, after getting the good doctor's wise 
advice, runs through it shouting, "I'm going to be the best damn 
menopause patient you've ever had!"  This is greeted by boisterous 
applause from the staff and patients.  </P>
<P>As God's gift to women, Dr. T proudly spouts his rules, worthy of pillow 
embroidery ("Never take a good woman for granted" and "Women by their 
nature are saints and must be treated as such.").  The doctor drives a 
big, old, cream-yellow Cadillac convertible with "DR T" vanity tags.  
His favorite past-time is hunting with his buddies.</P>
<P>The state of Texas (the setting of the story), especially it's place 
names and famous women, are so prominently featured that one wonders if 
the state had to fork over a large product placement fee.  The doctor's 
examination rooms are all named for well-known Texas women including Ann 
Richards, Belle Starr and Phyllis George.  The story even flaunts the 
great apartment rental prices offered in the Dallas area.</P>
<P>The movie's large and talented cast swarms around Gere likes he's the 
queen bee.  His performance, wise and soothing, is the best of the 
bunch.  It's too bad that the flitting and unconvincing script and 
direction gets in the way of our enjoying the acting.</P>
<P>Dr. T's wife, Kate (Farrah Fawcett), is losing her mind due to a disease 
that afflicts, we are told, only "women who are loved too much."  This 
causes her to strip completely naked in an exclusive shopping mall and 
dance in the indoor fountain.  This is first of many hard to buy 
episodes from Anne Rapp's script.  Notice how people just walk right by 
with few noticing a crazy, naked blonde, dancing and singing away.  Kate 
is the type of wife who notifies her husband that there will be no more 
sex, ever, since "it's not nice."</P>
<P>But don't worry about the good doctor, he'll still get his.  Although 
she knows he's married, Bree asks him over to her place.  After dinner 
she gives him a come-hither look and strips naked so that he can get 
from her what he's not getting at home.  This casual approach to 
infidelity should give viewers pause.</P>
<P>Other unbelievable parts of the narrative include the patient who 
insists on smoking like a chimney during her entire examination.  And 
another who wears a hat with a large feather during hers.</P>
<P>The story is way too cluttered.  One of the doctor's grown daughters, 
Connie (Tara Reid, BODY SHOTS), works as a guide at The Conspiracy 
Museum in Dallas.  This plot device allows Altman to take us to the 
infamous Texas School Book Depository.  Connie, pointing to the literal 
"X" in the road in front of it, enthusiastically tells her tour group, 
"That's where JFK's head exploded."</P>
<P>Kate Hudson (ALMOST FAMOUS) gets a small part as the doctor's other 
daughter, who is about to get married.  As her Maid of Honor, Liv Tyler 
is a woman with a secret in yet another of the many subplots.  Laura 
Dern is a mother who is a bulimic lush.  And Shelley Long is the 
doctor's unflappable office manager.  </P>
<P>The script's quirky charm does sometimes manage to shine through the 
clutter.  But the ending, reminiscent of MAGNOLIA's raining frogs, 
reminds us again of everything wrong with the movie.  For my money, the 
only Dr. T movie worth seeing is the 1953 movie, THE 5,000 FINGERS OF 
DR. T., based on a Dr. Seuss story and starring Hans Conried as Dr. T.</P>
<P>DR. T AND THE WOMEN runs a long 2:01.  It is rated R for graphic nudity 
and some sexuality and would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
