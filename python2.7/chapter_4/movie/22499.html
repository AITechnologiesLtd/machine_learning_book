<P>James Woods is such a volatile, energetic performer that he somehow makes every
film he's in his own, and does so by charging up the screen with tightly
controlled rage and tension. The same cannot be said for the turgid, monotonous
shenanigans of "John Carpenter's Vampires," a shallow film where Woods is
reduced to a one-dimensional sideshow attraction. </P>
<P>"Vampires" is set in New Mexico, where Woods plays vampire hunter Jack Crow,
whose mission is to search and destroy vampire nests in the countryside. He's
assisted by an anonymous motley crew of professionals armed with crossbows,
shotguns, and fishing lines (so they can drag the vampires out into the sun).
Oh, and there's a priest who comes along to bless each burnt vampire corpse.
The master vampire, Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith) eludes them during one of their
raids. As an act of revenge, he visits a party they are at that same night and
slaughters nearly everyone of them except for Crow and his partner (numbingly
played by Daniel Baldwin). Crow is then hired by the Vatican to kill Valek and
any other vampire nests that may have developed. In the meantime, Valek's
mission is to find a cross that will enable vampires to walk the earth during
the day. </P>
<P>"Vampires" could have been an old-fashioned B-movie with lots of gore and
witticisms courtesy of Crow and his crew. Once the crew is vanquished, though,
the movie loses focus and treads along cliched, charted territory. We get the
hooker (Sheryl Lee) who's bitten by Valek and can telepathically anticipate his
every move; the typical stake-in-the-heart theatrics (there must be more
original methods of killing vampires); the naive priest who turns out to be
heroic; and so on and so forth. As directed by Carpenter, this movie is
sluggishly paced and completely devoid of humor or horror. There's also an
anticlimactic ending that fails to deliver any thrills at all, surprisingly. </P>
<P>There are some pluses. For instance, when the vampires emerge from the ground
(as opposed to coffins), it is spectacularly shot and very menacing. One can
also savor the former "Twin Peaks" star, Sheryl Lee, who brings an element of
empathy to her stereotypical hooker character - she's abused and slapped around
by Jack and his sidekick in such a manner that you can't help but care for her.
Griffith is perfectly cast as Valek, and he'd be great as Lestat ("Interview
with the Vampire") if anyone cares to make another film version of Anne Rice's
novels. I also enjoyed the musical score by Mr. Carpenter himself. </P>
<P>This pseudo-horror western is not the first of its kind. I fondly remember the
cult film by director Kathryn Bigelow called "Near Dark," which also had a
western setting and an interesting central relationship between a vampire
couple. At least that movie moved along at a good pace. This one represents a
new low in Carpenter's career - he's lost the element of surprise. </P>
