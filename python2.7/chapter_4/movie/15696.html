<PRE>Happiness</PRE>
<P>Last week I was priveleged to catch the original _High Noon_ on the big
screen.  Gary Cooper plays the everyman, faced with a life/death
situation, and despite every opportunity to run, despite the objections
of a scared and lazy town, despite the logistics detailing a hopeless
situation, he stays and fights.  He miraculously triumphs.</P>
<P>_High Noon_, alongside the stellar _Casablanca_ and _It's A Wonderful
Life_, are similar in the base content, which is no doubt why they are
among the most powerful films ever made.  Each tells of a protagonist
who, despite all objections of society, sticks it out, and does the
hard, but honorable thing.  Sometimes he wins.  Sometimes not.</P>
<P>_Happiness_ is the polar opposite of the films I just described.  In
this film, we have a society that is peachy-keen, family-oriented, and
"perfect"; we have characters who "have it all."  But just below the
surface lies the makings of thieves, perverts, murderers, and
pedophiles.  Despite all inclinations to secure "happiness", every
character's moral failings catch up to them.</P>
<P>Todd Solondz, who wrote and directed _Happiness_, raises the debate with
this situation (one of many): A popular grade-school teacher turns out
to be a drug-addict.  Should she stay or go?  Initially, we side with
the mother: this is a potential harm for our children, the future of
society.  But the father raises an interesting point: should the woman
be ostracized for having a terrible addiction?  If she could do her job
without jeopardizing the kids or her health, while she fights to be
free, then shouldn't she get the support of the community?  Suddenly the
issue isn't so black-and-white.</P>
<P>This father, played by Dylan Baker, is the pedophile in the film.  He
acknowledges he to his wife that he is "sick", but she is oblivious to
his cries for help--she wouldn't want to upset her "perfect" family.
Baker has an impossible role, and succeeds.  He is indeed, a very sick
man, but despite all indications of the contrary, is a loving father and
responsible husband.  His final scene with his son, is as heartbreaking
as it is awkward as anything you'd find this year.</P>
<P>Another character reaching for perfection is that of Joy Jordan, played
excellently by Jane Adams.  (She's the sister of the wife, played by
Cynthia Stevensen).  She's still single, still living in her parents'
house, and unable to keep a steady job.  A former boyfriend kills
himself.  Another steals her guitar and CD player.  She's by far the
most sympathetic character in the film, and also the funniest.</P>
<P>The third sister, Helen Jordan is a sultry, successful single played by
Lara Flynn Boyle.  She's a critically acclaimed writer, but sees the
shallowness of success, and is angry that people do not see her
shortcomings.  When she receives an obscene phone call, who insults her
and threatens her with rape, she becomes immediately attracted to the
caller, (unknown to her, he lives down the hall).</P>
<P>He is Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman, with memorable turns in _Boogie
Nights_ and _Next Stop Wonderland_).  We would initially want him locked
away for good, but the film sympathizes with him.  He is obese, shy, and
socially inept.  The best scene is when he finally confronts Helen, she
invites him in, and they sit at polar ends of the couch, blank gazes.</P>
<P>There are many more characters here, but suffice it to say that this
isn't kiddie fare.  What's hard about reviewing (and praising) a film
like this is that we don't want to admit that we can relate to these
deplorable characters.  We don't want to exonerate the sin that has
become more and more commonplace in society.</P>
<P>Gratefully, the film doesn't explicitly show us the worst of these
crimes.  It miraculously maintains a light-hearted, breezy tone, coupled
with Air Supply and Debby Boone songs.  It is in this context that the
film forces us to examine these lives.  The "Hate the sin, love the
sinner" concept hasn't been more in-your-face.</P>
<P>Needless to say, box office predictions are very low.  I nearly
abandoned seeing this film, before forcing myself to catch it at a
second run theater.  I couldn't have been more surprised.  Despite every
plot detail pointing to the contrary, that this is truly one of the
sharpest, funniest, and most observant of films out there today.  It
deservedly won Best Picture awards at Cannes and Toronto.  It is
brilliantly photographed, which makes the material all the more
heart-wrenching.</P>
<P>While funny, I cannot express how adult the material is.  It is limited
in nudity and violence, and yet it is clearly NC-17 material, due to its
story and to humor that one-up's the jokes in _There's Something About
Mary_ (both films cover nearly the same terrain).  I highly recommend
reading the Screen It! review (www.screenit.com) if you are cautious
about racy material.</P>
<P>If I have any reservations of the praise, it's that the film ultimately
sides against the caring wife, in the dilemna posited above.  Of all the
negative characters in the film, she is the one who is bad because she's
so "good." Therefore, the script _must_ make her snide, haughty, and
self-righteous.  I don't think that's fair--"don't drink/don't
smoke/must be something inside."  Great satire is usually not
sympathetic to the one who stays and fights for what's right.</P>
