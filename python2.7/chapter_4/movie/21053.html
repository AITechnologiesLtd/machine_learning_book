<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Dirty Work is America's best comedy.  There.  Now maybe MGM can use that
quote in their newspaper ads.  Apparently, the buzz on the film was so
bad that they didn't screen it to the press until after the release
date.  I don't get it, because I thought the movie was very funny.  In
fact, I haven't laughed this hard since Ron Brown's helicopter crashed.</P>
<P>Funnyman Norm Macdonald stars as Mitch Weaver, a lifelong loser who
finds himself fired and kicked out of his house in the opening reel.
Mitch crashes at buddy Sam's (Lang, Mad TV) house, but not before his
sex-crazed father (Jack Warden) has a massive coronary from watching
aerobics on the telly.</P>
<P>Turns out Pops needs a heart transplant, which will run $50,000
according to the gambling-addict Doctor Farthing (Chase, Fletch).  So,
Mitch and Sam decide to start a revenge-for-hire business to earn the
money within the two-week deadline.  Simple enough, right?</P>
<P>The two dunderheads have quite a history in the vengeance business,
framing a childhood bully, a perverted crossing guard and the
neighborhood Doberman as kids.  And, my friend, they don't miss a step
in the transition to duping adults.  In fact, they ruin businesses and
condemn apartment buildings virtually at will.  There are also two
bizarre hallucination sequences featuring Gary Coleman (?).</P>
<P>Yeah, the story is boringly predictable, but it's loaded with tons of
filthy dick and shit jokes – most from so far out in left field that you
can't see them coming at all.  Most people forget that Macdonald wrote
for Roseanne back when it was somewhat cutting edge, and co-writer Fred
Wolf worked on the Chris Farley laugh-fests Tommy Boy and Black Sheep.
Bob Saget's direction is unassuming while the film is punctuated with
tons of hot, overplayed modern rock tracks.  But ruin a movie, they do
not.  Dick and shit jokes trump frat-boy music any day.</P>
