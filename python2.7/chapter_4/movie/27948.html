<P>In "The House of Mirth" no character is three-dimensional, therefore 
convincing. Not the irritatingly vague Lily, not the hazy male or 
the incomplete supporting female roles. Not even Eleanor Bron, one 
of the movie's rare non-American performers. She plays the 
disapproving, rich aunt whose speech, enunciation and pauses feel 
amateurish in a role that in bygone days would have featured Dame 
May Whitty or Edna May Oliver. (She's unrecognizable from the 
charming parts she used to play in the 60s, as in "Bedazzled.")</P>
<P>I like writer-director Terence Davies's modest output, especially 
his "Distant Voices, Still Lives" (two separate but interconnected 
films in one) and "The Long Day Closes." These are all based on his 
dreary life and working-class family in wartime and post-war 
England. The films are splendid downers in which the only solace for 
their denizens seemed to be lavishly sampled, mostly American pop 
songs and Hollywood flicks. Well worth renting.</P>
