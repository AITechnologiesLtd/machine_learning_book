<PRE>DIVIDED WE FALL
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Jan Hrebejk's DIVIDED WE FALL (MUSÍME SI POMÁHAT), a LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL LITE
tale, has trouble deciding on its tone.  Long serious moments are punctuated by
whimsical, light-hearted music, suggesting that we should be laughing, although
at what isn't apparent.  The settings are authentic, but the acting comes across
fairly flat.  </P>
<P>As the credits roll, the movie opens in 1937 in a field in which men are
urinating together.  Then a minute later, it skips to 1939 with men loading
boxes at a warehouse.  This brief scene is aborted in order to skip to another
inconsequential episode in 1941.  As the story jumps again to 1943 and the
credits are still showing, you being to calculate that the story will end
sometime in the twenty-third century.  Actually, it turns out that the movie is
set during the ending of World War II.  The purpose in this bizarre beginning is
never quite clear.  One supposes that it must have been an attempt at a
lightning fast introduction of the characters.</P>
<P>Josef and Marie Cizek (Bolek Polívka and Anna Sisková) are a Czech couple who
end up hiding a Jew, David Wiener (Csongor Kassai), in their secret room. 
Childless, they talk unconvincingly about how pleased they are that they can't
bring a child into the crazy world in which they live.  Horst Prohaska (Jaroslav
Dusek), a gregarious and obnoxious Nazi collaborator, likes to pop in
unannounced on his old friend Josef so that he can ogle his wife.  This causes
Josef and Marie to squabble about the importance of David's staying hidden in
his room.</P>
<P>Horst tries to teach Josef the art of blank facial expressions in order to keep
of out of trouble with the Nazi authorities.  The problem with the movie is that
too many of the characters seem to have mastered this statuesque lack of
expression.  The result is a movie that has little impact, save a few nice
moments here and there.</P>
<P>DIVIDED WE FALL runs 2:00.  The film is in Czech and German with English
subtitles.  It is rated PG-13 for some violence and sexual content and would be
acceptable for kids around 12 and up.</P>
