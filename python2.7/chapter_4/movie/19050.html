<P>PLOT:
Billy Madison is the spoiled, rich, immature, slacker son of a
multi-millionaire who is about to retire. To prove that he is worthy of
taking over his father's company, Billy must go back to school and pass all
of his classes from 1st to 12th grade. If he doesn't make it, one of his
father's evil henchmen will take over the corporate reins.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Adam Sandler's first starring role is pretty standard Sandler fare with a
touch of weirdness sprinkled throughout. This film is definitely not for
kids, geared more towards adults who love all of Sandler's stupid schticks,
his man-child character, rude behavior and over-the-top acting. I personally
like Sandler's tricks, despite the fact that not all of them work in this
movie. The plot in itself is a farce, and should not be taken seriously by
anyone, unless they are looking to hate this movie. It's a stupid comedy
movie that has been created to make you laugh at the exaggerated behavior by
Adam and his goofy buddies (Chris Farley and Steve Buscemi come through in
their nutty cameos). Unlike his other flicks, this movie takes some very
strange turns in its second half, with Sandler breaking into a musical
number, a person in a Penguin suit floating around, a wrestling character
saving the day and plenty of material to demonstrate the possibility of soft
drugs or heavy liquor being related to the writing of this screenplay :)
Throwaway plot but enough funny "Sandler moments" to satisfy anyone looking
for some strange, cheap laughs.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Sandler's love interest in this film, actress Bridgette Wilson, was Miss
Teen USA in 1990.
Adam Sandler brought some of his buddies from TV's "Saturday Night Live"
along for this one with Chris Farley playing the crazy bus-driver, Robert
Smigel portraying Mr. Oblaski, Tim Herlihy (head writer at SNL) co-writing
the screenplay with Adam and Norm McDonald playing his buddy Frank. Robert
Smigel is known for doing those goofy cartoon sketches on SNL and for being
the lips and voice of Bill Clinton on Conan O'Brien's TV "Late Show".</P>
