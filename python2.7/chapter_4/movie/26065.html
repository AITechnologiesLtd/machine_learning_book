<PRE>Rating: Near Miss  (2 out of 4 stars)</PRE>
<P>(Romijn-Stamos). It changes skins from social commentary to action film
to character study, never quite showing its face long enough to get a
good look. What's seen in those glimpses are the promise of a thrilling,</P>
<P>potentially thought provoking franchise of movies.</P>
<P>an allegory to man's oppression of man, whether it's racial or
ideologically based. The X-Men are a group of people whose genetic
makeup differentiate them from the rest of mankind. Their mutant DNA
gives them enhanced abilities. Some are powerful telepaths able to read
minds, such as the X-Men's leader, Professor X (Stewart). Others can
control magnetic fields, giving them mastery over anything with metal in</P>
<P>it, such as Magneto (McKellen). Still others have enhanced healing
abilities, or can create ice, or fire. Rather than consider their
abilities a gift, they are often viewing by those possessing them,
mutants, as a curse, serving to ostracize them from society.</P>
<P>The comic book series has been wildly successful for decades, mixing
kinetic, savage action with an often-blistering acuity for capturing the</P>
<P>despair of the downtrodden and disenfranchised. X-Men, the movie, gleans</P>
<P>the essence of the comic and effectively puts it on the screen.</P>
<P>The film opens as a flashback study of its villain, Magneto. Seen as a
young boy, his family is ensnared in the machinations of the Nazi war
engine as soldiers tear young Erik's parents from him as the family is
sheparded into detention camps. The experience unalterably shapes his
worldview. He thinks the only way for mutants to survive is to dominate
those who would subjugate his kind.</P>
<P>His opposite, Professor X, has a background that's only hinted at. He is</P>
<P>obviously rich and influential. He believes that humans and mutants can
co-exist, despite a senator's (Davidson) efforts to whip the country
into an anti-mutant frenzy. It's a thinly veiled allusion to McCarthyism</P>
<P>and the nazi regime. Professor Xavier is an ersatz King to Magneto's
Malcolm X.</P>
<P>With two decades worth of character development to mine and a squadron
of characters to manage, Singer succeeds with mixed results. Hayter and
Singer shrewdly balance the action scenes with character development,
but due to time constraints, some actors come off better than others. Of</P>
<P>the X-Men, worst of the lot is Storm (Berry), who not only is given
nothing to do, but has an accent that noticeably fades in and out.
Wolverine is an intriguing mix of toughness and emotional vulnerability.</P>
<P>Blessed/cursed with a skeleton made of indestructible metal, blade-like
claws that can project from his hands and the ability to heal from
almost any wound, he forges a surrogate father relationship with Rogue
(Paquin). Much of the film's empathetic and emotional strength draws
from the wellspring of their budding relationship.</P>
<P>Jackman plays Wolverine with the sharpness of ..... While the classical
theater trained Stewart and McKellen serves as solid bookends for the
acting ensemble, it's Jackman who provides the entrancing, substantive
middle. His Wolverine is perhaps the most confused and lonely of all the</P>
<P>deadly. Jackman could have done a lot of self-conscious posturing and
overly pensive emoting, thereby crushing any hopes the film might have.
Instead, he plays it remarkably straight. Wolverine is  a confused,
grown man yearning to find a place in the world, rather than a
wisecracking, super thug with the right answer to every situation.</P>
<P>Cyclops (Marsden), the X-Men's field leader and love of Dr. Jean Grey
(Janssen), projects a borderline arrogant smarminess.  An unbalanced
attempt is made at a potential love triangle between Wolverine, Cyclops
and Grey, but it's a sparkless connection.</P>
<P>Of the evil Brotherhood of Mutants, Toad (Park) and Sabretooth (Mane)
revel in the physicality of their roles. Sabretooth is an animalistic
sledgehammer of force, showing a reckless brutality unhampered by any
sign of true intelligence or cunning. Toad has all the grace of a grade
school bully, enjoying any opportunity to inflict pain with the warped
glee of a child burning ants with a magnifying glass. Romin-Stamos is a
bit of a cipher as Mystique. She has few words of dialogue and is
covered in blue scales and body paint, rendering her unrecognizable. Of
all the evil mutants, her presence is compelling. Is this due to some
heretofore-unseen acting ability, or the strength of the script playing
to her acting weaknesses?</P>
<P>The gist of the story involves Magneto's attempt to influence world
powers in embracing mutant kind, in the opposition to senator Kelly's
dogmatism on the subject. To that effect, he plans to use a special
device to genetically alter many of the world's leaders into mutants.
Xavier means to stop him. It's an admittedly simplistic story, but it
serves mainly to introduce the characters and set up conflicts for
future films. Hopefully future X-Men films will present themselves with
the same straight-faced earnestness of this one. By playing up the
humanistic angle, rather than heroic preening, Singer has made a film
that's accessible to both fans of the comic series and newcomers to the
storyline. There are obvious rends and tears in the fabric of X-Men's
script, but on the whole it plays as smart, fun entertainment with
promise. What more can you ask of summer fare?</P>
