<PRE>                             SUMMER OF SAM
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     As narrator Jimmy Breslin (as himself) puts it, there's 8 million
stories in the naked city, and this is one of them.  I just wish it
didn't have to be so long.</P>
<P>     Spike Lee's latest joint, like much of his recent work, is an epic
exercise in tedium.  While it's punctuated by moments of greatness – and
sometimes, even genius -- those moments come too few and too far between
to make SUMMER OF SAM a truly great film.  Sure, the tale of New York
City in 1977, when David Berkowitz, a.k.a. Son of Sam, was marauding
Brooklyn with a .44 revolver, is a great place to start.  But clocking
in at almost 2 1/2 hours, you're likely to wish Son of Sam had taken you
out at the halfway point.</P>
<P>     Again, Lee has plenty of raw material to work with: Leguizamo,
Sorvino, and Brody are all great actors (I'm blocking THE PEST from my
mind, forgive me), and the clever, neo-16mm look Lee has put on the film
really drops you into the late 1970s lock, stock, and mirrorball.  With
the disco/punk clash going on, a record heat wave, and Reggie Jackson
taking the Yankees to the World Series, the mis en scene is certainly
set.  Spike knows New York cold.</P>
<P>     But what about this script, which wanders aimlessly among Leguizamo
and Sorvino's marital troubles, Brody and his infatuation with the punk
scene and his need to do gay porn to earn cash, the mob society of
Brooklyn, and, of course, the Son of Sam and the dog which tells him to
kill Kill KILL!  These are actually four of those stories in the naked
city, and it's hard to care about all of them together.  A dozen
meandering side plots don't help matters either.</P>
<P>     However, Spike does excellent work putting you dead center in this
turmoil, and that I can respect.  But please, somebody bring me the head
of the editor on a silver platter.  (Of course, there were actually two
of them working on this picture... sigh.)</P>
