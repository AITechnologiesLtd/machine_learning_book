<PRE>BLADE                                
RATING:  6.5 / 10 -> So-so </PRE>

<P>Take some SHAFT (7.5/10), toss in a couple of pieces from the original
CROW (8.5/10), slap in some special effects a la SPAWN (6/10), and top
it off with some LOST BOYS (8/10) and BATMAN (8/10) wanna-bees, and
you've got yourself this summer's dark superhero flic via New Line
entitled BLADE. </P>
<P>PLOT:
An underworld of vampires is living amongst us, and they are no longer
satisfied with being second-best. They are ready to take over the
world, and only one half-man/half-vampire named Blade can stop 'em. </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Regurgitated plot line from a dozen better pictures, superb action
sequences, half and hour too long, and one bad-ass mutha' as the
superhero carved by way of Wesley Snipes, makes this comic-book based
movie bearable, but far from highly recommendable or rewatchable. If
you like the martial arts and the crazy special effect action
arrangements, this movie might be moocho enjoyed by you. If on the
other hand, you are one of those rare people who still likes to sink
their teeth into a little plot once in a while, you might as well wait
for the video version of this toothless story.  </P>
<P>Having said that, Wesley Snipes was totally kickass in this role, and
rocked the house in every scene in which he appeared: cool and f-ckin
scary! Unfortunately for the audience, Kris Kristofferson joined the
fray as some wise old fart there to help Blade or something, but God
knows Blade didn't need help from some boring actor with a fake bum
limp (And aren't we all sick of these superhero movies that always seem
to contain the proverbial sensible ol' saps there to aid our hero in
their quest for goodness? I know I am.) Add that to the contrived
over-acting by Stephen Dorff, whose career is going nowhere and slow,
the uncharismatic N'Bushe Wright who can't seem to muster any interest
into her unnecessary character, and the rest of the no-names who
delivered their cheezy lines much like the dead bodies on which they
gorged. </P>
<P>Luckily for us all, Blade does spend a lot of time kicking people's
ass, and splattering blood wherever he roams, so that pretty much
dragged me over the more tedious moments in this overly long film.
Snipes was super-cool, and much like Shaft, I'm not afraid to admit
that he was one bad mutha! (Shut your mouth!) The style of the film was
basically in MTV mode, with all the required flashing lights and
electro music following close in tow. I thought the soundtrack could
actually have been much better, instead of what seemed to be the same
electronic beat dancing through all of the action scenes (see THE CROW
soundtrack for a much better mix). All in all, this film is lightly
recommended on the action scenes and Wesley Snipes' performance alone.
On the other hand, if you do not like blood, Snipes or action
sequences, skip this dull knife, crack open a couple of cold ones, and
dunk your fat face straight into a pile of nachos, and call it a night.
Your primordial senses will thank me in the morning.</P>
