<PRE>                                 MORTAL KOMBAT
                       A film review by Thomas Wheeler
                        Copyright 1995 Thomas Wheeler</PRE>
<P>Presented by New Line Studios and starring Christopher Lambert</P>
<P>     Video-game based movies have never done especially well.  Nobody
wants to talk about SUPER MARIO BROTHERS anymore, and while STREET
FIGHTER wasn't bad, most aficionados of the video game weren't
especially impressed.  I've always felt the reason that such movies
fared poorly was the lack of background information on which to build a
successful movie.  In STREET FIGHTER there were some interesting
characters, and there *is* a fair background to them in their Japanese
incarnation, but really, for a full-length movie, what could you *do*
with them?  There was also a complaint about a lack of *fights*, which
is what the game was all about.</P>
<P>     All of that is easily taken care of in MORTAL KOMBAT.  This isn't a
movie for everybody, and it surely lives up to its PG-13 rating.  Don't
think that this is a kids' movie.  Older kids, yeah, but there are some
truly horrifying scenes, such as the destruction of Scorpion, that are
not appropriate for small children.</P>
<P>     You want fights?  This movie is a cross between a roller coaster
ride and a swift kick in the head.  It is absolute, unmitigated, almost
non-stop slam-bang action that *still* manages to tell an interesting
story, which, for a change, ties in *very* closely with its root concept,
in this case the video game.  Too often, I feel, some producer,
director, or studio takes a concept from some other source; book, comic
book, cartoon, or whatever, and feels the need to twist it around and
put their own mark on it.  This is *not* the case with MORTAL KOMBAT.  If
you like the game, you'll *love* the movie.</P>
<P>     The actor who plays Liu Kang (his name escapes me) is a well known
martial arts actor in various Oriental countries.  Martial arts movies
haven't been too popular in America for a couple of decades now.  We've
gotten used to the types of action scenes that generall involve either
fisticuffs or large heavy equipment.  These fights are truly
choreographed, and the effort put into them shows.</P>
<P>     Then there's the eight-foot tall, four-armed Goro.  This is no
Muppet, folks.  He's one very large, very nasty piece of
audio-animatronics equipment.  The special effects, mostly computer
generated, are truly spectacular.  There's even a bit of humor here and
there, mostly from Christopher Lambert, who plays Rayden and seems to
enjoy playing the least physical role in the movie while everybody else
gets the stuffing kicked out of them at one point or another.</P>
<P>     I went to the first showing, and the theater was *packed*!  This
on a hot Arizona day with school having just started.  Like I said,
this isn't a movie for everyone.  But if you like action movies, and
have even the slightest knowledge of Mortal Kombat, go see this film.
You *will* have a good time.  I'm going again just so I can pick up on
what I missed the first time around.</P>
