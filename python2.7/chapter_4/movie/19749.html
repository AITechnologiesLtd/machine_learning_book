A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Garry Marshall</PRE>
<P>Written by: Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott</P>
<P>Starring: Julia Roberts, Richard Gere</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
Small town bride Maggie Carpenter (Julia Roberts) has been nicknamed the
runaway bride for leaving various men stranded at the altar. On three
different occasions Maggie has gotten cold feet and dumped the groom by
running away in the middle of the wedding ceremony. Because she's too used
to playing along rather than asserting what she really wants Maggie just
can't make the big commitment.</P>
<P>When cynical USA Today columnist Ike Graham (Richard Gere) blows into town
to cover Maggie's fourth wedding attempt and write a nasty article, he ends
up falling in love with Maggie. </P>
<P>Opinion: 
After nine years PRETTY WOMAN director Garry Marshall and stars Roberts and
Gere are reunited for another romance, apparently in the hopes they'll cash
in on the PRETTY WOMAN nostalgia crowd. While RUNAWAY BRIDE does provide
the nostalgia of seeing Roberts and Gere reunited in romance, it lacks two
key ingredients: warmth and conviction.</P>
<P>As city slicker Ike Graham, Gere is condescending to the rural folk,
treating all townspeople like idiots to be easily swindled and charmed. The
townspeople actually vindicate this view by acting like rubes, dolts and
alcoholics, especially during the pre-wedding dinner. RUNAWAY BRIDE's
portrayal of rural people as self-absorbed, unintelligent, or drunk never
wavers, and this is how the film loses charm.</P>
<P>The token characters that Roberts and Gere play aren't written with
conviction. Maggie says her basic problem is that she is unable to assert
her individualism. But how come in her spare time she kickboxes and creates
unique art? Similarly, Ike Graham is supposed to be from New York, but his
New York accent occasionally vanishes.</P>
<P>RUNAWAY BRIDE is an okay movie for taking the wife or girlfriend because it
is a paint-by-numbers romance, because crowd favorites Roberts and Gere are
easy protagonists to cheer for, and because the movie contains at least one
great commercial for Federal Express. But if you hate predictable movies
you'd better buy yourself a big cup of coffee.</P>
