<P>"October Sky," a film directed by Joe Johnston ("Honey, I Shrunk the 
Kids," "Jumanji"), had a fair amount going against it. For one, Johnston 
previously had specialized in mostly special effects-laden productions; 
it's film studio was Universal, who recently released the painfully 
manipulative "Patch Adams," and the story, judging from the trailer, 
could have easily gone the same easy route into utter corniness. 
Fortunately, "October Sky" appears to have been written instead with a 
great deal of care by Lewis Colick, and therefore comes across as a 
realistic portrait of a certain moment in time. The film is based on a 
true story, by the way, and also unlike "Patch Adams," appears to have 
stayed very, very close to what actually happened, instead of taking 
noticable liberties in exchange for cheap, artificial melodrama.</P>
<P>Set in Coalwood, West Virginia, circa 1957, "October Sky" begins on the 
monumental day of Oct. 5 when Russia beat the Americans to space with 
their first satellite, called Sputnik. Homer Hickum (Jake Gyllenhaal), a 
teenager whose father (Chris Cooper), a stubborn coal mining supervisor 
in the town, clearly favors his older brother who has just gotten a 
football scholarship to college, knows that he was not meant to be a 
miner, and doesn't want anything to do with it. Soon, inspired by 
Sputnik, Homer acquires his two buddies (William Lee Scott, Chad 
Lindberg) and the class brain, Quentin (Chris Owen), to begin to make 
small rockets. Their understanding and friendly school teacher, Miss 
Riley (Laura Dern), encourages them to enter the state science fair 
because she truly believes in them, and Homer automatically sees this 
opportunity as a way to possibly get away from his ultimate dead-end 
existence as a coal miner (the winner of the state goes on to the 
country, and the person who takes first place gets a college 
scholarship).</P>
<P>Although "October Sky" follows a fairly predictable pattern, the film 
turned out to be first-rate, thanks to the delicate and innocent way 
that the story was told, and in the satisfying way that the characters 
were handled. The subplot involving Homer's stern father could have 
easily characterized him as a one-dimensional jerk, but instead, played 
terrifically by Chris Cooper, who also stood out in John Sayles' 1996 
film, "Lone Star," we learn that he does care about his son, even if he 
has a difficult time showing it. Quite a few moments between father and 
son are finely-tuned and ring with a resounding truthfulness that you 
don't often see in mainstream films today. Also making an impression are 
Gyllenhaal, in his first major feature film role, who acts as our 
likable and sympathetic protagonist; Natalie Canerday, as Homer's loving 
mother who becomes torn between her feuding husband and son; and Laura 
Dern, radiant as always, in the relatively small, but touching role of 
Miss Riley, a young woman who sees teaching as a pointless means of work 
if she can't inspire and help her students get out of their nearly 
unavoidable destinies to become miners. It is ultimately in the exact 
performances and writing that are the primary reasons "October Sky" 
works so well. </P>
<P>If there is one subplot in the film that could have been dealt with in a 
more gratifying manner, it is that of Homer's crush on his older 
brother's girlfriend, and another girl who does like Homer, even though 
he mostly ignores her. This almost same exact situation was far more 
satisfying in the recent brilliant motion picture, "Rushmore." One 
slapstick-style sequence that seems out of place shows the four boys, 
early on, testing out their rockets, only to see them fail in some way; 
the way that the scene was filmed and edited together, played to the 
tune of a '50s song, didn't really seem to belong in the context of the 
rest of the film.</P>
<P>These, of course, are mostly insignificant criticisms when compared to 
the whole of the film, which is a rare film that does not short-change 
its characters or their plight in any way, nor does it trivialize them. 
In its surprisingly effective, subtle concluding moments when we find 
out the fates of all the characters, shown with home-movies of the real 
people the film was based on, I had realized that "October Sky" was made 
by a group of filmmakers and actors who cared deeply enough about the 
people and true accounts that the story was based upon that they in no 
way attempted to add a bunch of flashy extra stories that would make the 
film more accessible or commercial to a wider audience. Good for them.</P>
