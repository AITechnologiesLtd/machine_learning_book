.                             THE BIG LEBOWSKI
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1998 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     It bears repeating: Just because you happen to make an amazing,
perfectly-crafted, wildly funny movie (FARGO), doesn't mean you can do
whatever the hell you want in your follow-up and pass it off as art.</P>
<P>     THE BIG LEBOWSKI is the definitive answer to skeptics like me who
wondered if FARGO was the fluke, and ho-hum flicks like THE HUDSUCKER PROXY
and RAISING ARIZONA were more the norm for the Coen brothers.  They
undoubtedly are.  In THE BIG LEBOWSKI, the Coens had the world to play with
as a palette.  What they delivered is a wreck.</P>
<P>     The story, what little there is of one, follows Jeff "The Dude"
Lebowski (Bridges), a bum/amateur bowler who gets caught up in a
kidnapping-gone-wrong scheme involving a millionaire who happens to have the
same name.  Promising premise (even if it sounds familiar...), but the story
is totally blown on one-dimensional goofball characters, blind side plots
that go nowhere, and a meandering plotline that barely keeps you awake.</P>
<P>     Sure, with characters like Goodman's Vietnam vet/wacked-out bowling
buddy, Moore's new age "vaginal" artist, and, most memorably, John
Turturro's minuscule role as Jesus, the most flamboyant bowler alive, there
is plenty to be amused by in the film, and sometimes it's absolutely
riotous.  But the laughs are hollow... because the story just sits there
like a 7-10 split.</P>
<PRE>     I wish the Coens the best, but they're going to have to do better than
this.  I know they can.</PRE>
