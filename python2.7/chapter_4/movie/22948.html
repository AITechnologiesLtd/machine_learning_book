<P>_The_Big_Tease_ (R) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>        Watching the opening moments of _The_Big_Tease_, my heart immediately
sank.  Here was another comedy using the much-exhausted mock documentary
format (last used, to ill effect, in _Drop_Dead_Gorgeous_) only to
frequently break its rules--as in, how the heck did they get all these
angles with one camera?  Furthermore, director Kevin Allen was not
executing the premise--Scottish hairdresser Crawford Mackenzie (Craig
Ferguson, who also co-wrote) comes to Los Angeles for the premier
hairdressing competition, "the Platinum Scissors"--beyond the obvious:
broad, cutesy, and obvious fish-out-of-water gags.</P>
<P>        Then a strange thing happened from the 25-minute mark: I began to be
charmed by this film.  The key to the big turn is that Allen, Ferguson,
and his writing collaborator Sacha Gervasi stop trying so hard to be
outrageously funny and trust the absurdity of the story to speak for
itself--resulting in some golden comic moments, such as one where
Crawford wins over a snooty publicist to the stars (Frances Fisher) by
identifying her entire hair care regimen with a simple glance. 
_The_Big_Tease_ is far from original--it fits squarely in the
_Full_Monty_ tradition of feel-good comedy from the British Isles--but it
gets the predictable job done.</P>
