<P>     THE LOST WORLD made me sweat, which may be the highest compliment
that I can pay to what's really just a jokey, at-times-intentionally
hokey monster movie.  For better or worse, the Master (again along with
writer David Koepp, loosely adapting from Michael Crichton's best-
selling screenplay, er, novel) has simply cut and pasted the same scare-
tactics from the first film:  thud scream chomp run repeat.  Only, this
time, there's more.  More mechanical dinos.  More high-tech toys to
smash.  More humans getting gobbled, from the four-person research team
sent to Site B (a *second* island, where the creatures have been running
amok for four years) to the band of big-game hunters, who are also on
hand.  Same-o same-o, really, but with a handful of changes and one up-
roarious final sequence, set on the streets of... well, now, that would
be telling!</P>
<P>     The most noticeable change in Steven Spielberg's sequel is that
it's darker than the original, both literally (photography) and
figuratively (tone).  There's more death, though most of the munching
occurs off-screen.  (What you *do* see, you won't forget.  Such as, heh,
two Tyrannosaurii playing "wishbone.") And there's more humor.  Jeff
Goldblum, still wearing black leather in the tropics, gets off a good
number of sarcastic quips and exasperated asides.  ("She can't not
touch," he exclaims when his paleontologist girlfriend pets a baby
stegosaurus.) The other human actors (Julian Moore as said girlfriend,
Pete Postlethwaite as the Great White Hunter, etc.) are less funny and
largely less interesting.  Those stars with the *least* personality,
however, are the dinos.  Rex Galore exhibits nothing in the way of wit,
intelligence, or good manners, and, frankly, if they didn't keep killing
people and smashing stuff, this would be one boring amusing ride.  Which
it isn't, unless you're expecting something other than a give-them-what-
they-say-they-want sequel.</P>
<P>     My dinosaur bones of contention are few and far between.  The over-
lighting at the beginning is a bit distracting.  As are most of Spiel-
berg's trademark reaction shots.  (I would submit that *any* shot that
gets in-between the good stuff and more good stuff is counter-productive
to a creature-feature's best intentions.) So, no, the sequel to the
highest grossing film of all time isn't exactly the leanest thing on
either two or four legs.  Nor is it entirely mean.  Despite the darker,
harder edge-- for a pleasant change, a Disaster Movie Dog *doesn't* make
it out alive-- THE LOST WORLD is very much a corporate-sponsored family
film.  And while it does push the "PG-13" rating to new limits, this
WORLD is still *way* too nice.  No mass death.  No chunks of gore.  No
ordnance-induced animal control.  By, hey, it may make you sweat!</P>
