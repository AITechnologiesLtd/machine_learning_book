<PRE>SMALL TIME CROOKS</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * *</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Woody Allen                                                 
                           Written by: Woody Allen</PRE>
<P>Ray Winkler (Woody Allen) is an ex-con who now works a menial job and 
dreams of a better life. His latest lame-brain idea is to rent space in 
a store across from a bank and tunnel under the street into the bank's 
vault. Ray brings three friends, Denny (Michael Rapaport), Tommy (Tony 
Darrow), and Benny (Jon Lovitz), into his scheme to help him dig the 
tunnel. His wife, Frenchy (Tracey Ullman), and her brain dead cousin, 
May (Elaine May), work a cookie shop in the space they have rented to 
hide Ray's activities. The plan doesn't work quite the way Ray intended. 
In fact, it doesn't work at all. The group has been so busy tunnelling 
they haven't noticed what a hit Frenchy's cookies are, and they decide 
to turn the little store into a huge franchise. Ray and Frenchy are now 
rich beyond their wildest dreams, but it affects them in two very 
different ways. Ray somehow turns into even more of a slob, wanting 
nothing to do with a rich lifestyle. Frenchy has become so completely 
infatuated with her new way of life that she hires an art dealer, named 
David (Hugh Grant), to teach her how to act like her new wealthy 
friends. Soon Ray and Frenchy are drifting down very different paths, 
and Frenchy starts to think she may have outgrown Ray.</P>
<P>Let me start by saying that I have never cared for Woody Allen's films, 
thus my opinion of this movie may be a tad biased. I've never understood 
Allen's humor - like when Frenchy says something sarcastic to Ray, and 
he responds with "I'm this close to popping ya Frenchy, just one more 
word." It wasn't funny back when Jackie Gleason said something similar, 
and it's somehow even less funny when Allen says it now. The only funny 
thing about it is that I think Tracey Ullman could probably beat Allen 
up. I will say this, "Small Time Crooks" actually starts off rather 
funny, with Ullman given a few amusing, witty comebacks to some of 
Allen's dumber statements. In fact, the first third or so of the film is 
really quite funny. Watching the four bumbling criminals try to carry 
out their plan is uproariously funny at times, especially when they 
break a pipe in the wall and flood the entire store. Unfortunately, once 
they make their fortunes, and the whole rags-to-riches story takes over, 
all the humor is sapped out of the movie. I suppose Allen was trying to 
show the benefits of a simple life compared to an extravagant one; but 
if that's the case, he failed miserably. Both lifestyles looked pretty 
horrendous.</P>
<P>Woody Allen has always seemed to be one of the more irritating actors in 
Hollywood. I think his stuttering over every word and bumbling around 
like a buffoon is supposed to be funny, but here's the fact of the 
matter: Woody Allen is too smart to play a stupid character. I've seen 
him in interviews, and the man is too intelligent to convincingly play a 
bumbling idiot. This may be why he has surrounded himself by characters 
even dumber than Ray. Michael Rapaport ("True Romance") is notorious for 
playing brainless characters, and he plays more of the same here. Jon 
Lovitz ("Trapped in Paradise") is infamous for playing irritating 
characters, and Benny probably would have been fairly annoying if given 
more screen time. Actually, nearly the entire supporting cast is stupid 
(I mean that in an unfunny way), irritating, or both. The only 
exceptions are Tracey Ullman, in the film's first half, and Elaine May 
(you remember, she wrote and directed "Ishtar" way back when) as the 
hilariously dense May. If it hadn't been for Elaine May's presence, I 
probably would have rated this film quite a bit lower. She is so 
likeable and naive that she can't help but make the movie at least 
somewhat enjoyable. Last, we have Hugh Grant ("Mickey Blue Eyes"), who 
serves no purpose and seems to realize this judging by the performance 
he gives.</P>
<P>The thing which most bothered me about "Small Time Crooks" was that 
Allen leaves a dozen or so loose ends. Characters vanish half way 
through the film and are never heard from again; romantic angles arise 
but are never dealt with; and the ending doesn't tie things up quite the 
way I would have liked. There are numerous other faults, though they are 
fairly minor. There isn't much of a soundtrack; some of the scenes feel 
rushed (the first dinner party and the aftermath of the cookie company 
being created), while others seem to drag on forever (any scene with 
Hugh Grant); and the comic pacing is non-existent at the film's 
midpoint. The film's high points are Elaine May, Ullman's occasional 
smart-alec comments, and the attempted bank robbery. "Small Time Crooks" 
does run an admirable 94 minutes at a time when films running less than 
two hours are becoming a rare breed. Fans of the old Woody Allen films 
will probably enjoy it because he's back to his screw-ball antics rather 
than the dramatic pictures of the last few years. If, like me, you don't 
care for Allen's brand of humor, I'd suggest you skip this one. I give 
it three out of five stars.</P>
