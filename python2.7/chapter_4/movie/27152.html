<PRE>Creator/destroyer
Pollack</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>Ed Harris paints a striking portrait of this talented artist/butt-hole. 
A docu-drama (with the accent on drama), "Pollack" follows the ten last 
years of the life of American abstract artist Jackson Pollack who died 
in 1956. </P>
<P>It's a story of splashing paint, sobering love, anger, self-doubt and 
spilt and broken liquor bottles. Filmed in one strong arch-like stroke 
that peaks in the middle then splatters off the canvas in an untimely 
manner, the production, like Pollack's life, feels truncated and 
unfulfilled. </P>
<P>Paced well, aside from a laboriously slow introduction, Harris is 
intoxicating. Marcia Gay Harden, as his lover, endless supporter, is as 
steadfast as a whipping post. It's great to see Bud Cort again (Harold 
and Maude) though his bright-eyed smile too soon leaves the screen. 
Kilmer's brief appearance adds little. </P>
<P>I loved the artistic moments of creation. Harris staring at his shadow 
on a huge white canvas (so huge he knocked down a wall in his apartment 
to erect it). Harris finally finds inspiration to contrast his stillness 
with sharp confident motion pulling the emotions from his chest to the 
end of his brush. Simply awesome, simply beautiful. </P>
<P>When asked, "How do you know you're finished with a painting?"
Pollack replies with a question, "How do you know when you're finished 
making love?" </P>
<P>But more often than not, this portrayal captures a bottle at the end of 
his arm, not a paintbrush. And an unforgivably belligerent mood, that 
rushes like red pigment into the lives of those around him. </P>
<P>Probably an excellent depiction ... if so, Jackson seems a man, I'd have 
not enjoyed getting to know. Hence, this intimate movie ... of me will 
not a friend make. </P>
