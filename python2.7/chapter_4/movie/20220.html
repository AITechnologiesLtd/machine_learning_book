<PRE>HOW YA GONNA KEEP 'EM DOWN ON THE FARM?</PRE>
<PRE>XIU XIU, THE SENT-DOWN GIRL
Directed by Joan Chen
With Lu Lu, Lopsang
Grand Illusion     not rated   </PRE>
<P>     In 1975, during that Chinese orgy of ideological puritanism known as
the Cultural Revolution, young people from the cities were sent to the
sticks to purge themselves of the stench of urban sophistication and learn
good peasant values.  The teenage Joan Chen escaped ruralization by being
accepted at the state acting school, and went on to a distinguished
international career ("The Last Emperor", "Twin Peaks", etc.)
     In her directorial debut, Chen revisists those days with the powerful
there-but-for-the-grace-of-God tale of Xiu Xiu (Lu Lu), a teenager from
Chengdu who is farmed out for a six-month apprenticeship to a horse herder,
on some vague and woolly-headed plan that has something to do with the
starting of a women's cavalry.  Her assigned mentor, a rugged older man
named Lao Jin (Lopsang), lives alone in a hide tent in the middle of a vast
empty range near the Tibetan border.  
     Though they share close quarters, Lao Jin is no sexual threat.  He was
castrated while the captive of enemy tribesmen.  In any case, his
temperament is gentle and protective.  He does all the work, while Xiu Xiu
sulks and puts on airs.  She doesn't seem to learn a thing, but when her
time should be up she becomes concerned when nobody comes to fetch her
home.  Eventually a peddlar shows up who tells her that the youth program's
over, and everyone's scrambling for a permit to go home.  For a roll in the
hay, he might be able to pull a few strings....
     The performances by the two principals are compelling.  Lu Lu builds a
character whose attitude is not always appealing, but whose helpless,
battered naiveté touches your heart.  Xiu Xiu's loss of innocence, which
accelerates through a series of callers with cynical promises of help as
word spreads of an easy lay in the wilderness, is made the more poignant by
her continued cluelessness.  Lao Jin's impotence extends to his inability
to interfere; he can only withdraw in disapproving sadness as the stream of
visitors passes through, and be ready to tenderly pick up the pieces. 
Lopsang makes him a figure of crippled dignity and wounded depth.     
     There is a rugged, almost nightmarish beauty to Chen's vision of this
forgotten outpost, where the eye sweeps from horizon to horizon unrelieved
by anything but the encroaching menace of storm clouds.  Chen shot most of
her footage on location without a permit from the Chinese authorities, who
would not have granted one and will not allow the film to be shown in
China.  Though it suffers at times from the monotony of its situation and
the adolescent petulance of its heroine, "Xiu Xiu" is a trenchant
indictment of a system in which ideology goes to bed with bureaucracy and
the progeny are abandoned to indifference.</P>
