<P>If Paul Newman acted in a so-so movie and nobody went to see it, would he
still be considered a great actor? You bet! Newman recently announced that
he would be making one more picture, his "swan song", and calling it a
career. Of course, everyone and their uncle wants Newman to get together one
more time with that guy who runs the Sundance Film Festival...what's his
name...something-or-another Redford. Anyway, only time will tell what will
happen to the king of popcorn and salad dressing, but for now, let's focus
on yet another movie which was filmed entirely on location in my hometown of
Montreal, Canada.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A lifelong bank-robber fakes his own stroke in jail so that he could be sent
to a temporary nursing home, from where he intends to find an easier route
to the outside world. Unfortunately for him, his nurse is on to his game and
ultimately ends up trying to convince him to work with her on one more bank
job.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
As I left the theater, I was still a little confused as to what kind of film
they were going for with this one. If it was meant as a crime caper, it
failed because there really wasn't much tension, suspense or action. If it
was meant as a romance or drama, it failed to a certain extent, because
there was actually very little chemistry between husband and wife, even
though Newman did manage to shine all on his own. His back-and-forths with
Fiorentino were definitely the highlight of the film. And lastly, if this
film was meant as a comedy, it didn't fully achieve its full potential
either, with only a handful of guffaws sprinkled lightly across its quick
90-minute canvas. Of course, it really shouldn't matter whether or not one
could qualify this film in any specific category, as long as the film can be
entertaining as a whole. Unfortunately for this movie, it rarely peaked any
level of interest on my part, especially after its extremely slow start and
eventual predictable story line.</P>
<P>Of course, I still recommend seeing it (although I would suggest waiting for
video), only because of the understated performance by Newman, who doesn't
achieve the emotional vibe that he was able to contribute to NOBODY'S FOOL,
but definitely tweaked enough of my interest, to sit through the film's
unoriginal plotline. Points also go out to Fiorentino, who had up until
recently been relegated to roles featuring her gruffy voice and fine legs
(this film also focuses on her booty), scoring with a solid performance of a
down-and-out small town nurse looking for a way out of her hum-drum life.
Her sexual appeal also decided to make a palpable appearance in this film,
with a touch of THE LAST SEDUCTION still shining through. As a whole, the
film doesn't suck by any means, nor does it bring anything exciting to the
table. It's a very generic tale of an old-time crook looking for a new
score, and a new crook looking for some old-time help. Some charm, some
laughs, zero tension, solid performances by Newman and Fiorentino, wrapped
in a so-so story. Sound interesting to you? Well, maybe you should just see
it to pay tribute to one of America's favorite actors. And no...I'm not
talking about Dermot Mulroney! :)</P>
