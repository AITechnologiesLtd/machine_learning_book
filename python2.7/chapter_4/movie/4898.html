<P>     Once, not that many years ago, it was difficult to find an 
intelligent gay/lesbian love story.  Now, with features like GO FISH and 
JEFFREY reaching multiplex screens, the field is no longer as barren.  
Nevertheless, there's still quite a bit of fertile ground worth 
exploring.  LATE BLOOMERS encroaches on this territory, taking a 
"traditional" lesbian romance and adding a twist:  both characters are 
middle-aged, and one is married with two children.</P>
<P>     Dinah Groshardt (Connie Nelson) is a lonely high school basketball 
coach, and Carly Lumpkin (Dee Hennigan) is the principal's secretary.  
Carly's dissatisfaction with her passionless marriage to her math 
teacher husband, Ron (Gary Carter), leads her into a friendship with 
Dinah.  For a while, their relationship remains platonic, but Carly and 
Dinah eventually admit their attraction to each other.  Once they become 
sexually involved, Carly leaves her family to live with Dinah, and 
rumors about their "perversion" spread throughout the conservative 
community where they live and work.</P>
<P>     In its depiction of an unlikely romance, LATE BLOOMERS is touching 
and sensitive.  The two principal characters are nicely-developed, and 
Gretchen Dyer's script doesn't condescend to either.  The film also 
examines how Carly's sexual awakening affects her husband's and 
childrens' lives.  The most interesting relationship is that of Carly 
and her teenage daughter, Val (Lisa Peterson), who feels betrayed by her 
mother's change of sexual preference.</P>
<P>     Of course, once Dinah and Carly come out of the closet, they are 
universally vilified.  LATE BLOOMERS goes over-the-top in portraying the 
homophobic reactions of the townspeople towards the two women.  Every 
anti-gay cliche is used, and the story becomes oppressively 
melodramatic.  There's even an absurd moment when a woman pulls her 
daughter off Dinah's basketball team in the middle of a game because she 
hears a rumor about the coach's relationship with the secretary.  This, 
and other similar moments, weaken LATE BLOOMERS' impact.</P>
<P>     Connie Nelson and Dee Hennigan are solid in the lead roles, but 
Gary Carter is ineffective as Ron, and Lisa Peterson gives an uneven 
performance.  Director Julia Dyer goes for a tone that's part hard-
hitting drama and part erotic fairy tale.  Her results are mixed -- 
sometimes the two compliment each other, but there are also moments when 
they're at cross purposes.  Ultimately, LATE BLOOMERS is better-written 
than many lesbian romances (such as, for example, CLAIRE OF THE MOON or 
DEVOTION), but it still falls into enough melodramatic traps to keep it 
from rising into the genre's upper echelon.  </P>
