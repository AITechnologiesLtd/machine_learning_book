                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     If Robert Altman's THE PLAYER taught film makers one lesson, it's 
that it's hip to satirize Hollywood.  There have been a lot of recent 
motion pictures cashing in on this theme, with varying degrees of 
success.  SWIMMING WITH SHARKS, the latest entry, tries a slightly 
different tactic than most of these other movies--instead of focusing 
on writers prostituting their talent, George Huang's picture looks at 
corporate ladder climbing within a fictional production studio. </P>
<P>     Kevin Spacey, in a performance that must be seen to be appreciated, 
plays Buddy Ackerman, the nastiest executive in the movie business.  
Aside from rarely showing a trace of humanity, Buddy loves to shout, 
insult, and generally demean everyone under him, and since he's the 
Senior Executive Vice President of Production, there are a lot of people 
in that category.  Spacey plays the role with relish, managing somehow 
to retain the skeleton of a legitimate character in what was written as 
a pure caricature.  Far more credit goes to the actor than to the script 
for Ackerman's nasty, vicious flair.   </P>
<P>     If Buddy is the boss from hell, Frank Whaley's Guy is the poor sod 
who has to serve his every whim.  Personal Assistant to Ackerman might 
be the first step up the corporate ladder, but it's a pretty dismal 
place to start.  In this position, you're not supposed to think, just 
please and pamper the man who signs your checks.  And that's what Guy 
does, day in and day out, until he finally snaps.  What follows is like 
a variation on DEATH AND THE MAIDEN, with Guy tying Buddy up, then 
subjecting him to a verbal and physical barrage. </P>
<P>     Somewhere along the way, SWIMMING WITH SHARKS loses its direction.  
What starts as a biting, and often effective, satire turns into a 
dramatic look at the dehumanizing effects of losing one's hopes and 
dreams.  The split focus doesn't really work.  Not only is it 
disconcerting to watch a funny movie turn suddenly grim, but Whaley's 
character doesn't have the necessary depth for us to believe the 
transformation he supposedly undergoes--a transformation that is key 
to accepting the conclusion.   </P>
<P>     SWIMMING WITH SHARKS contains some tremendous scenes.  Most of 
these are early in the film, before it takes its bleak detour.  Certain 
comments about Hollywood are scathing, pointed, and hilarious.  
Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be enough material here to satisfy 
a full length feature, and the movie, which starts with such promise, 
begins to drag around its midpoint.  From then on, despite a few brief 
rallies, the script never regains its early momentum or clarity, and, by 
the closing credits, SWIMMING WITH SHARKS is just treading water. </P>
