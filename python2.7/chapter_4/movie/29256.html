<P>Valentine opens in 1988, where a young, nerdy boy asks several girls to
dance with him at a middle school Valentine's Day party.  They all refuse,
and a psychopath is created.  Flash to 13 years later, where all of the
girls who snubbed the boy have grown up to be serious spanking material and,
for some strange reason, are all still living in San Francisco.  One, a
medical student (Roswell's Katherine Heigl), becomes the jilted lover's
first victim in truly predictable fashion (the only thing unpredictable is
that she's studying for finals in February).  We quickly learn that the
killer intends to eliminate the other girls in a similar fashion.  Oh, and
he wears a cherubic Cupid mask, just like one of his classmates had that
tragic night in the sixth grade.</P>
<P>The girls - three blondes and Denise Richards (The World Is Not Enough) -
are murdered one at a time, and the film's goofy script offers several weak
red herrings to throw you off the trail.  The identity of the killer, which
isn't revealed until the last frame of the film, is so painfully obvious, I'
m surprised they don't just show it in the film's trailer.</P>
<P>It's one thing to make a slasher flick and do something original with it
(like Scream), but Valentine doesn't even attempt to distinguish itself in
any way.  It barely makes sense (one of the girls is killed in public.at a
crowded party.and is never discovered), and I actually saw several people
checking their watches during what were supposed to be the exciting scenes.</P>
<P>Angel's David Boreanaz plays one of the girls' boyfriends, and he can't act
for shit.  The whole hunched over, monotone thing he does on television is,
apparently, the extent of his range (there are two Angel jokes that may have
actually been unintentional).  The girls are all unlikable, and none of them
get naked.  Since nudity is sometimes the only redeeming quality of a horror
film, this is a pretty big thing to omit.</P>
<P>Valentine was directed by Jamie Blanks (Urban Legend) and written by Donna
and Wayne Powers (Deep Blue Sea), and Roswell writer/producers Gretchen J.
Berg and Aaron Harberts.  The story is based on a novel written by Tom
Savage, which, from what I understand, is a pretty good read.  The book
spends a great deal of time developing the killer's character, and has him
off his victims one at a time annually on Valentine's Day.</P>
<P>1:38 - R for strong horror violence, some sexuality and language</P>
