<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>For a film that runs close to 70- minutes, is in B&W, and is short on
storyline, this B-film does a nice job in getting a hugh cast to be part
of this crime caper, each getting into the act with a brief moment of
quality movie time.</P>
<P>The suave star of the Falcon series, George Sanders, has grown tired of
the role and wanted to move on to bigger and better things in Hollywood,
so what better way to do it than to get his younger brother Tom Conway
to become the next Falcon, private detective. This is smoothly arranged
in the script by RKO, as Sanders gets knocked unconscious for most of
the film and Tom shows us that he can play the Falcon with the same
deftness as his Russian born brother can. When the surprise ending
comes, Sanders gets himself killed off the series and graciously passes
the role onto the future Falcon, who will appear in 8 more of these
lightweight crime stories. The reason Tom has a different name, is
because George came first and Hollywood decided that Tom should be the
one to change his family name.</P>
<P>The Falcon's Brother is a routine espionage story, that is crisply told
in a manner that is formularised and executed to perfection. Gay
Lawrence (Sanders) goes to meet his brother Tom (Conway) coming in by
boat from Nassau, whom he hasn't seen for 5- years. When he arrives with
his stooge-like cohort, Lefty (Barclay), he is told that his brother
committed suicide. But when he goes to identify the body, he realizes
that is not his brother, but he doesn't tell that to Inspector Timothy
Donovan (Clark), and instead follows an attractive woman, Diane Melford
(Andre), who hurriedly leaves the boat.</P>
<P>The place she leads the Falcon and Lefty to is a woman's fashion salon,
where the head designer is Arlette (Wynters) and her love interest is
her underling, Paul Harrington (Newill), who is also having a
relationship with the designer from the firm, Diane. But before you can
catch your breath and take in the fashion show going on, Diane is shot,
and the Falcon is suspected of killing her by the police for revenge of
his brother's death, since she was dating him on the boat trip and the
Falcon was spotted by the police following her after she left the boat.</P>
<P>The Falcon goes on the run, collecting evidence on the way, he already
has the poison cigar that killed the unidentified body aboard the boat,
proving that it wasn't a suicide. He runs into his brother in the alley
and gets sideswiped by a car trying to kill him, and this will
incapacitate him for most of the film, as Tom without missing a beat
takes over the case.</P>
<P>There's not much to the plot, it's about Nazi agents trying to
assassinate some South American diplomats and Tom hooking up with a
fashion model reporter Marcie Brooks (Randolph), who has ambitions to
land a job as a crime reporter and to land the handsome future Falcon.</P>
<P>Everything in this film goes as expected, the cops are gently razzed,
the villains are easy to detect, the romance is easy to handle, the
story is easy on the noggin, and if you are not looking for anything
fancy here, you'll extract your ounce of entertainment value from it. If
you've seen one Falcon episode, then you might as well have said you've
seen them all. This one would rate as an average one. The best one that
Sanders did, is probably, the first of his five, The Falcon Takes Over
(42).The reason they were so popular, is because they're so easy to
watch and the stars exude a certain amount of charm, making these little
crime capers quite enjoyable.</P>
