<P>     In these days of high-tech special effects and big screen derring-
do, watchable action films typically come in one of two categories:  
those that tell a good story and those that don't tell much of a story, 
but look good all the same.  THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, Chow Yun-Fat's 
entrance into American multiplexes, falls squarely in the latter 
category.  The plot is so thin that it's not really worth thinking 
about, but director Antoine Fuqua and cinematographer Peter Lyons 
Collister have put so much effort into the feel and appearance of the 
movie that it held my attention.</P>
<P>     Like Jackie Chan several years ago, actor Chow Yun-Fat is 
internationally revered but hardly known in the United States.  That's 
because his career has thrived in Hong Kong, and motion picture exports 
from that country rarely find more than a token audience of devotees in 
this one.  However, as part of the mass cinema talent exodus from Hong 
Kong last year, Chow joined former director John Woo on this side of the 
Atlantic, and, with Woo acting as an executive producer, THE REPLACEMENT 
KILLERS was born.  </P>
<P>     As I said, there isn't much of a story -- just a flimsy excuse to 
connect a number of kinetic action sequences.  This is truly a "flashes 
and bangs" motion picture -- albeit a gorgeous-looking one.  Chow plays 
John Lee, one of the world's premiere assassins.  When he refuses to 
fulfill a contract that requires him to kill the son of police officer 
Stan Zedkov (Michael Rooker), he earns the enmity of Chinese mob boss 
Wei (Kenneth Tsang).  In his flight from Wei, Lee enlists the aid of a 
forger, Meg Coburn (Mira Sorvino), who gets more than she bargained for.  
Soon, the two of them are on the run, with the police and hired killers 
on their trail.</P>
<P>     The director of this movie is Antoine Fuqua, but a viewer could be 
forgiven for thinking it's John Woo.  The action sequences all have the 
same kind of choreographed style evident in Woo's films, even to the 
point where moments are shamelessly pilfered from two Woo/Chow 
collaborations, THE KILLER and HARD BOILED.  The presentation of THE 
REPLACEMENT KILLERS is also very Woo-like, featuring the meticulous use 
of light and shadow, and a rich palette of colors that saturate certain 
scenes with reds, ambers, greens, and blues.  With the nearly non-stop 
action and the constant visual stimulation, it's virtually impossible to 
be bored by THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS.</P>
<P>     Chow literally strides into his first American film like a god.  
Fuqua films the actor's first appearance as befits a living legend, 
showing him walking purposely across the floor of a dance club.  He's a 
figure in a suit and sunglasses, with strobe lights and smoke all around 
him.  It's a moment that cries out "Cool!"  Then the action -- which is 
mostly gunfire -- begins.  One thing that disappointed me about THE 
REPLACEMENT KILLERS is that Chow, whose stature as a mega-action star 
belies his legitimate acting talent, isn't given a chance to show any 
dramatic range.  John Lee is a generic character -- Jean-Claude Van 
Damme could have done almost as well with this limited role.  Similarly, 
Mira Sorvino isn't offered much to do except look tough, run around 
after Chow, and occasionally shoot someone.  </P>
<P>     The terms "eye candy" and "testosterone flick" were coined for 
movies like THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS -- mildly entertaining features that 
don't amount to much.  It's all sound and fury signifying nothing.  
Nothing, that is, except the arrival of Chow Yun-Fat into the American 
mainstream.  If he makes any kind of impact, the action genre will never 
be quite the same.</P>
