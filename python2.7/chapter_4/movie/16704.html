<P>Forget the three-hour supposed mess that was THE POSTMAN. Forget the fact
that he left his wife of 16 years to cuddle up to some supermodels. Forget
the fact that he once called a Madonna show live in concert "neat". Kevin
Costner is back in top romantic form, in his Dockers and comfortable shirts,
soft-spoken nature, and everything else the Valentine-less women might be
seeking over this lover's weekend.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Man loses a wife. Man writes her letters in a bottle and tosses them into
the ocean to ease his pain. Another woman finds the messages and sets out to
find the man behind the beautifully honest words. Once found, the two share
each other's pains and experiences, and find some solace, and more, in each
other's company.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
An ironic adult story of love and mourning. This movie is a bit slow, has
some nice romance, bordering on sappiness, some solid acting performances,
and a hokey ending. For all those who go to see this film expecting to find
a wonderfully romantic time at the movies, well, you might be quite
disappointed. This movie does have some tender moments, along with some
romantic touches, but over and above it all, it caters to a story line
drenched in the incapacity of a man to move on with his life, after his
loved one has passed away. This film might even be a success in the hearts
and minds of all those people whose lives have suddenly halted after the
loss of someone dear to their hearts. Don't get me wrong, there is an
obvious love story that brews up between the two leads here, it's just that
I didn't expect the grieving undertones of the film to be as accentuated as
they are.</P>
<P>The actors are all very good with Costner pulling off another vulnerable,
nice, tough and rumble everyguy with his eyes closed and his hands tied
behind his back. Wright Penn is also decent in her role, but nothing to
write into a bottled letter and drop into the ocean. Newman on the other
hand seemed stereotyped from what I had seen of him in the previews, but
actually zings it up as the gruffy ol' dad, reminiscent of his wonderful
performance in NOBODY'S FOOL (8/10). Mood-wise, the whole "feel" of the
movie is very comfy and authentic, especially during the wooing sequences
over the first half of the movie. If you're a sea lover, you might love this
film even more, since the water does seem to permeate these peoples' lives
quite deeply. Overall, the cinematography is nice, the actors are all very
good, but I found the whole piece to be a little too slow and uneventful for
my taste. It seemed to be much more of a cathartic picture rather than
romantic, but all in all, not an awful movie. And yes, Mrs. JoBlo and I did
catch it on Valentine's Day!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Kevin Costner auditioned three times for the role that eventually went to
Nicolas Cage in the wonderfully, outrageous RAISING ARIZONA (8/10). His role
in THE BODYGUARD was originally written for Steve McQueen. He played the
dead body in THE BIG CHILL. He stands 6'1".
Robin Wright Penn backed out of the role of Maid Marian in ROBIN HOOD:
PRINCE OF THIEVES, starring Kevin Costner, after getting preggers with Sean
Penn's kid. She played the role of Jenny in 1994's award-winning FORREST
GUMP (7.5/10) opposite Tom Hanks. Her first acting gig on TV's "Santa
Barbara" soap opera garnered her three Emmy nominations.
Actor John Savage, whose real name is John Youngs, may be best remembered
for his portrayal of the character Steven in 1978's classic THE DEER HUNTER
(7.5/10). He also spent 6 years, from 1988 to 1994, in South Africa, working
with Nelson Mandela for the anti-Apartheid movement.
In respect to actor Paul Newman, by the time the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences honored him with its Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in
1994, he had raised over $80 million in support of various charities through
his many philanthropic activities (and his own food product line called
"Paul Newman's Own"). He is an avowed lifelong beer lover. He has six kids
and has been married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958. His only son
Scott Newman died of a drug overdose in 1978.
Actress Illeana Douglas dated famed director Martin Scorsese for a few years
during the 90s.
Actor Robbie Coltrane is British. He played the newspaper columnist in this
picture.
Director Luis Mandoki is not a stranger to melancholic, romance stories. He
also directed Meg Ryan in WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN, and Susan Sarandon in
WHITE PALACE (8/10). Mr. Mandoki hails from Mexico.
Producer Denise DiNovi has collaborated on five of director Tim Burton's
projects.</P>
