<PRE>                                 CLOCKERS
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks

<PRE>***1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Spike Lee strikes again, with another story of trouble in the 
hood. CLOCKERS shows us the influence older people have on young 
people and why innocent people sometimes take the rap for people 
they love. In this case, responsible brother Victor confesses to a 
murder his brother, Strike (don't ask about the name--my guess is his 
parents were big fans of either bowling or baseball), actually 
committed. It's a long story (about two hours and ten minutes worth), 
but Strike was following orders from his boss Rodney, who got 
absolutely no respect from the victim.</P>
<P>        Strike is a clocker. No, he doesn't manufacture timepieces, he 
does something infinitely more illegal, selling crack. (It's a shame 
people throw their lives away raising money for their crack addiction 
when they can get it free by watching "NYPD Blue." One of life's 
better-kept secrets, I guess.) Strike isn't just protected by his brother, 
he also has an older cop named Andre looking out for him. 
Apparently, the two of them were once good friends, until the 
dangerously lethal world of drug dealing lured Strike into its 
menacing claws, as revealed by this line of dialogue--while Strike is 
riding in Andre's cop car, handcuffed:
        STRIKE: These cuffs is tight.
        ANDRE: You and me used to be tight.</P>
<P>        Yes, it sounds every bit as corny in the movie as it does on 
paper, but I can forgive the occasional lapse in good drama the same 
way I can forgive the speech every character eventually gives, from 
clockers Strike and Rodney to cops Andre and Harvey Keitel, who 
plays the homicide detective convinced Victor is covering up for his 
brother. Keitel and John Turturro, who is mostly kept in the 
background as Keitel's partner, are the token white guys in the movie.</P>
<P>        Making matters worse, Strike takes a liking to a child named 
Tyrone, who looks up to the drug dealer as a hero. Strike casually 
shows Tyrone how to handle a gun and cut cocaine properly, 
remembering of course to tell Tyrone not to do those things himself 
because drugs and violence are bad. Needless to say, the hasty 
disclaimers contradicting the long monologues that precede them are 
ineffective, and soon Tyrone is imitating his older friend, with tragic 
results. The message is that, if little kids see grownups doing 
something that looks cool, they'll emulate it, no matter how many 
times adults half-heartedly tell them it's not good for them. I can 
honestly say that's the reason I started eating tubs of cake frosting at 
such an early age.</P>
<P>        CLOCKERS is a compelling, dramatic story from a talented 
man who seems to reinvent his directorial style with each new movie. 
(The only thing all Spike Lee movies have in common is overuse of 
the F-word... "fiddy.") This time, visually, it looks like a cross between 
MTV and "Cops." Thematically, the message of CLOCKERS is as 
important as any other Lee movie, and he once again paints a picture 
of a world where cops can give young black men body cavity searches 
in daytime at the park. I think I've seen this portrayal somewhere 
before, perhaps in an adult movie I saw at midnight in a hotel room. 
That's a different story...<HR></P>
