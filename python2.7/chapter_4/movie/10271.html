<PRE>.                               THE ICE STORM
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1997 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Kitschy seventies comedy does battle with some painful dramatics in Ang
Lee's highly-regarded THE ICE STORM, but the question of which of these wins
is still in the air.</P>
<P>     It's 1973, and the sexual revolution is in full bloom.  So are the thick
shag carpets, glass-bead necklaces, Watergate hearings, and teen angst.  And
its an Arctic Thanksgiving weekend in Connecticut where these things all come
together, at the home of a small and highly dysfunctional family.</P>
<P>     Kline and Allen are the hapless parents of Maguire and Ricci, and
everyone's up to no good in the sex department.  Dad is having an affair with
the next door neighbor (Weaver), and the kids are ripe for all manner of
trouble with show-and-tell games, experimental drugs, et. al.  Oh, and Mom is
pretty pissed about all of this.</P>
<P>     Taken the wrong way, all of this can be pretty hilarious, and for the
first hour, it is, as reminiscing over the maroon tux I wore to my cousin's
wedding wins out over the drama behind the non-stop 70's jokes.  But after
that, the film takes a somber, almost melodramatic tone, and it ceases poking
fun and starts asking questions -- questions which, ultimately, are never
answered to any degree of satisfaction.</P>
<P>     The tragic ending is expected and simply doesn't leave you at peace. 
While I'm not the type of moviegoer who needs everything neatly spelled out, I
do appreciate some sense of closure.  In the end, this film is an enjoyable
one, but it may be a little too hip for its own good.</P>
