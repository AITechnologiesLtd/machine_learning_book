<P>I've been to plenty of long movies before.  THE GREEN MILE clocked in at
3 hours plus (though it didn't seem that long to me).  And on the other
end of that spectrum, STUART LITTLE (chronologically short at just 94
minutes) seemed *much* longer.  I've been to plenty of long movies
before.  THE PATRIOT wasn't just long.  It was *torture*; sheer
manipulative torture.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
1776.  A time of upheaval and revolution in these (not quite) United
States Of America.</P>
<P>Widower Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) is a man who has known war, and no
longer wants any parts of it; he just wants to farm, make bad rocking
chairs, and be left alone to raise his seven young children.  His eldest
son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger), doesn't understand Ben's pacifistic mood,
and wants to join the Colonials to fight against the Evil British Empire
and old tax baron King George.   After the Evil British Colonel William
Tavington (Jason Isaacs) wreaks havoc on Ben's family and land, Ben
leaves his youngest children with their aunt Charlotte (Joely
Richardson), so he and Gabriel can join forces with Regular Army Colonel
Harry Burwell (Chris Cooper) and French Army officer Jean Villeneuve
(Tcheky Karyo) to create a militia to go up against Tavington and
slightly-less Evil General Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson).</P>
<P>[And lots more stuff that takes up two hours and forty-five minutes of
movie time.]</P>
<P>The Upshot:
I sat myself down and thought long and hard about what made me the
maddest about THE PATRIOT, to the point where its greenlight for its
epic sweep and beautifully-filmed tale, turned into a yellowlight for
its manipulative nature.  Here's what I told a dear friend about it,
with regard to the other "based on a true[r than *this* one, dadgummit]
story" out this week, THE PERFECT STORM:</P>
<P>    What I liked most about [THE PERFECT STORM] (and conversely,
    hated most about THE PATRIOT), is the way the actors seemed to
    capture the real, messily imperfect folks they played; from
    everything I've read about the production [of "Perfect"], the
    actors and director and such were extremely cognizant of the
    background story, and wanted very much to do those people honor
    (rather than playing the "Look at me, I'm an artiste and a
    battle-recreator!" game that Gibson and the folks attached to
    "Patriot" seemed to).  It shows.</P>
<P>"Manipulative" is the word I keep coming back to when I think about THE
PATRIOT.  It's not enough, it seems, that this movie is being released
around the fourth of July; Independence Day roun' dese hea' parts.  No;
"we must forcefully remind The Uhmerkin Public", the filmmakers seemed
to say, "that Gibson...uh, blue-eyed Benjamin Martin, was a True
American Hero, by having him Wave The Flag Meaningfully at every
opportunity!  And hey, while you're at it, have a few of his friends and
family members die Slow Heroic Deaths with the camera trained on their
faces for a godawful long time, whydoncha?  And ooh yeah, that image of
Mel baby Running Boldly Into Battle with just that battered flag,
*that'll* hit 'em where it hurts, eh?"</P>
<P>Bah.  Just tell me the story, dammit; let *me* decide when and where to
cheer for them, eh?  I don't need no friggin' equivalent to a laugh
track, spattered into so many manipulative scenes.  Bad moviemakers.
Bad, Bad moviemakers.</P>
<P>In all fairness, though, THE PATRIOT latches on to its single-mindedness
and never lets go; at least it's not wishy-washy in its dogged
determination to make the viewer Love Benjamin and his family for being
Epic Heroes.  Even when it speaks of Ben's Unspeakable Past, you learn
early on that Ben was just doing what he had to do For God And Country.
Can't blame a fella for that, even when it leaves him bloody, can ya?
Not the way these moviemakers were selling the story, you can't.</P>
<P>(And don't get me wrong: not having had to ever do much heavy fighting
outside of the time Judy hit me in the stomach with a two-by-four when I
was 13, I'm *not* saying that War Ain't Really Hell; I'm sure it is that
and much more.  What I *am* saying, however, is that the audience
doesn't need to be battered upside the head with the Wifflebat to get
that point.  I understood it after the first hour of my battering; I
didn't need to have it go on for the whole almost-three hours, sheesh!)</P>
<P>I know I'll be in the minority of the reviewing population--I heard
Raving Reviews about "Patriot" blaring on the radio just before I went
to see it (which, in and of itself, gave me a Bad Feeling)--but this
telling of THE PATRIOT didn't move me at all.  Actually, it did: it
moved me from being sympathetic to the cause of a young--and, let's be
honest: White--nation getting its legs under itself, to being cynical
and critical about that *other* part of itself that THE PATRIOT tried to
whitewash over: the folks that were somehow forgotten in "We The People".</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
We The People.  Hold These Truths To Be Self-Evident.  All Men Are
Created Equal.  That is, "we, the White, male landowners, see it that
way--about us".  All others need not apply.</P>
<P>It was this undeniable truth about the establishment of "a more perfect
union"--that its people were only "created equal" if and only if they
were White, male landowners--that grated me most about THE PATRIOT and
its whitewashing-over of its colorful tale.  If the folks behind this
movie had not addressed it (slavery: the big It) at all, then, fine.  I
wouldn't have had an issue with their looking-over of that big It.  But
they addressed It.  Badly.  Shame on 'em, I say.</P>
<P>A little truth goes a long way; but "Patriot" couldn't seem to face up
to the realities of its own time, *this* late into the moviemaking game
(well past the time when the filmmakers could've claimed ignorance about
such things).  And that--much more than the fact that I never caught the
name of the Black slave character, only knowing him from his
introduction as "my nigra"--is what finally brought "Patriot"'s house of
cards tumbling down for me.  In all its flag-waving, it seemed to forget
that even back then, these States weren't as United as the Founding
Fathers claimed they were.</P>
<P>History, it seems, *does* tend to repeat itself.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
Call me cynical, call me anti-American, whatever; but I hate feeling
manipulated, and that's exactly how I felt watching THE PATRIOT.  I went
into this movie with an open mind, hoping to learn something more about
what made the early revolutionaries in these, yes, great United States,
tick.  I came out of it with a contempt for what I had just been put
through.  And that's *never* A Good Thing.</P>
<P>THE PATRIOT (rating: yellowlight):
If only they had stopped waving the flag long enough to see the hearts
and souls that went into weaving that symbol of independence...</P>
