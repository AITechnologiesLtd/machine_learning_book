"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>I love The Rocky & Bullwinkle Show as much as anybody else. I even named
my cats Boris and Natasha. But the idea of a full-length film featuring
the flying squirrel and the 400-pound Wossamotta U. graduate brought
chills to my spine. Not good chills, either. See, the whole appeal of
Jay Ward's cartoon series, which ran from late 1959 through 1964, was
that there was just enough Rocky and Bullwinkle to keep you interested.</P>
<P>The half-hour show always started with a brief clip of the duo getting
in some type of cliffhanger-type trouble and ended with them foiling
Boris and Natasha's dastardly plans. In between these two parts were
Fractured Fairy Tales, Peabody's Improbable History and a bunch of other
solid animated entertainment. Rocky and Bullwinkle were just a small
part of the show. So how could it possibly work as an hour-and-a-half
film without the support of Peabody, Dudley Do-Right and Snidely
Whiplash (that's my other cat's name)?</P>
<P>The answer is a short one - it doesn't. The dry humor and silly puns get
really tiring after about twenty minutes, but thankfully R&B features
enough inspired casting and self-mockery to make the film somewhat less
torturous than it could have been. R&B opens with an animated Rocket J.
Squirrel and Bullwinkle J. Moose, who have been living off of puny
residual checks from the show's reruns, which have been airing since the
1964 cancellation. It seems that in the last thirty-six years, poor
Rocky has lost the ability to fly.</P>
<P>Flash from Frostbite Falls to Pottsylvania, the home of Boris Badenov
and Natasha Fatale. Through some bizarre blend of science and nonsense,
the two baddies and their fearless leader (named Fearless Leader) submit
a movie script to a beleaguered movie mogul (named Minnie Mogul and
played by Janeane Garofalo, Mystery Men) and are somehow transformed
from cartoon into reality. Jason Alexander (Seinfeld) plays Boris, Rene
Russo (The Thomas Crown Affair) tackles Natasha, and Fearless actor
Robert De Niro becomes Fearless Leader.</P>
<P>The three hatch a plan as diabolical as ever – taking over every cable
television station with something called RBTV (or `Really Bad
Television'). The broadcast signal of RBTV will hypnotize the entire
country into voting for Mr. Leader in the upcoming Presidential
election, thus ousting current Commander-in-Chief, President Signoff
(James Rebhorn, Snow Falling on Cedars), from office.</P>
<P>Luckily, the FBI is on the case, assigning bumbling, knock-kneed Agent
Karen Sympathy (newcomer Piper Perabo from the upcoming Coyote Ugly) to
entice Rocky and Bullwinkle out of retirement to stop the
mass-hypnotism. The squirrel and moose remain animated, despite the fact
that the three bad guys are now real. Isn't this a big plot hole? Well,
yes, but the whole film doesn't make sense. It knows it doesn't make
sense, and it doesn't care. And that's damn admirable, especially after
something like Gone in 60 Seconds, which was just as illogical but
pushed itself as a serious action film.</P>
<P>Eighty-year-old June Foray still provides Rocky's voice, while Aussie
Keith Scott (who narrated Ward's overrated George of the Jungle film)
handles voices for both Bullwinkle and the film's narration. There's
also a load of cameos, from Carl Reiner, Jonathan Winters and Don
Novello, to Randy Quaid, Billy Crystal, Whoopi Goldberg and Good
Burger's Kel Mitchell and Kenan Thompson. John Goodman, who will play
Perabo's father in Ugly, also has a small role in the film. There isn't
a lot of acting going on here, as most of the talent spends the entire
film reacting to characters that weren't there during filming.</P>
<P>R&B was directed by Des McAnuff, who helmed the abysmal Cousin Bette,
but also was a producer on The Iron Giant. The screenplay was written by
Ken Lonergan (Analyze This) and features a dazzling score by Devo's Mark
Mothersbaugh (Rugrats). Lonergan's script is peppered with a decent
amount of pop culture references (like spoofing DeNiro's famous
monologue from Taxi Driver), and several miss-‘em-if-you-blink homages
to the original show (like the Wossamotta U. infirmary being called the
`J' Ward).</P>
