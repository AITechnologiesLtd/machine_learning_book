<P>When I heard about the background of this movie, I thought of an African
fable I learned as a child, that of Anasi The Spider, told to me in many
variations.  I don't remember the details of it very well, but the
memory came to me as an analogy to the legend of Wong Fei-Hung.  When I
found out that the Fei-Hung I enjoyed so much in LEGEND OF DRUNKEN
MASTER was the grown-up version of the one in IRON MONKEY, I found
myself anticipating it, just as I had, years ago, anticipated hearing a
new version of the Anasi tale.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Legend has it that in 1800s China, warlords ruled the land, causing the
countryside peasants to flee and seek protecting as refugees in China's
big cities.  Unfortunately, greedy merchants and corrupt politicians
made the refugee's life a difficult one.  The good news was that in
Chekiang province, there were kind people like Dr. Yang (Rongguang Yu)
and Miss Orchid (Jean Wang) to help care for the mistreated peasants.
And that a man known as Iron Monkey was there to rob from the rich and
give back to the poor.</P>
<P>This, of course, doesn't sit well with the town's leading official,
Governor Cheng (James Wong), who wants to keep all his "hard-earned"
money to himself.  The Governor charges Chief Fox (Shun-Yee Yuen) with
hunting down the Robin Hood of China; but it soon becomes apparent that
Fox and the traitorous Shaolin monks in his employ, can't handle the job.</P>
<P>Paranoid about the Iron Monkey, the Governor orders anyone who even
*looks* like they have any monkey in them [Driving While Monkey?] to be
arrested.  Wong Kei-Ying (Donnie Yen), an innocent monk travelling
through town with his son Wong Fei-Hung (Sze-Man Tsang), is profiled and
arrested along with other innocent villagers.  The Governor, seeing
Kei-Ying's mighty kung-fu, uses Kei-Ying to track down Iron Monkey - by
holding his son Fei-Hung hostage.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
My wait was not in vain.  Though IRON MONKEY is new to the U.S., it
actually predates LEGEND OF DRUNKEN MASTER (itself a late U.S. release)
by one year: IRON MONKEY was released in Hong Kong in 1993, as SIUNIN
WONG FEI-HUNG TSI TITMALAU ("Iron Monkey: The Young Wong Fei-Hung").
Both films share a wonderful sense of wit, a grand display of martial
arts skill and artistry, and a warmth not found even in one of my
favorite films of all time, CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON (which shares
another datapoint in common with IM: director Yuen Woo-Ping
choreographed the CT/HD fight scenes - and it shows).</P>
<P>In fact, I have a hard time separating these three films in my Best Of
Genre sights.  Where CT/HD was more grandiose, IM, in its relative
simplicity, was easier to believe; its lack of out-and-out fantastical
mysticism made it more immediate, more human.   And though LODM was much
more out-and-out funny at times, IM's use of humor blended more
naturally with its storytelling.  IM may not have had a lead with the
overpowering presence of a Chow Yun-Fat, or the hilarious timing of a
Jackie Chan, but the team of Donnie Yen, Sze-Man Tsang, Rongguang Yu,
and Jean Wang, are no slouches either.</P>
<P>Yen and Tsang match beautifully, with Yen displaying a calm charisma
that did remind me of Li Mu Bai in CT/HD, but with less of that
character's standoffishness; and Fei-Hung's monkey-like mimicking of
father Kei-Ying made Tsang a joy to watch.  The other duo, Yu and Wang,
were also good, together and separately.  I was floored by one of their
first shared scenes - a "simple" act of picking up scattered paper - and
found myself wishing that the romance in CT/HD had been drawn nearly as
well as the story of Dr. Yang and Miss Orchid.  And needless to say,
this foursome can kick some serious booty.</P>
<P>I have mixed feelings about the supporting characters.  It was good to
see many of the characters I had seen in LODM - the witch (Fai Li), the
disfigured warrior (Hou Hsiao), and unless I'm mistaken, Hin Hung the
monk (Sai-kun Yam) - but it would've been nice to have had some idea
where those characters came from, rather than just seeing them show up
to kick some serious booty [not that there's anything wrong with that.]
Similarly, James Wong didn't add any real nuance to his ObIdiot
Governor; except for the necessity of twists in Chief Fox's story, the
Governor character could've been dropped altogether, with Chief Fox
being The Bad Guy in his place.  But I have no such Issues with Chief
Fox himself; Shun-Yee Yuen gave this character layers that I found
pleasantly interesting to watch.  And Hiu Hing, Shaolin Traitor (Yee
Kwan Yan) will always be My Boy if for no other reason than introducing
me to Flying Sleeve!</P>
<P>In a way, I wish I had seen them in chronological order: IRON MONKEY
first, then LEGEND OF DRUNKEN MASTER, and CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON
last.  I wasn't as wowed after seeing IM as I was after CT/HD, partially
because of advances in "wire-fu" technology since 1993, I think.  I just
hope that that advancement doesn't affect IM's box office success; it is
a film that should be seen on its own terms, not just as a predecessor
to a more technically-advanced chop-socky flick.  Meaning THE MATRIX, of
course.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
Check out IRON MONKEY: a less polished, less mystical - but somehow
warmer and more pure rendering - of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON-type
storytelling, with the humor (and shared storyline) of LEGEND OF DRUNKEN
MASTER.  Like those movies, IRON MONKEY (and its sequel, IRON MONKEY 2)
will most def become part of my DVD collection, once Amazon brings this
movie back to its virtual shelves.</P>
<P>IRON MONKEY (rating: greenlight):
I think I'll be spending a lot more time looking for legendary fables at
the library - and the video store - if they're told half as well as the
one in IRON MONKEY.</P>
