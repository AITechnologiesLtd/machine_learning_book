<PRE>A REVIEW OF "KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN"
A RETRO REVIEW, 1985
by Ryan Ellis</PRE>
<P>give me a buzz on the ol' e-lines, <A HREF="mailto:iluvmick@hotmail.com">iluvmick@hotmail.com</A></P>
<P>William Hurt, monotone-voiced star of "The Big Chill", "The
Accidental Tourist", "Children Of A Lesser God", and "Broadcast
News" in the '80s, also played the lead in this picture and won
his only Best Actor Oscar. Starring opposite the now-deceased
Raul Julia, Hurt was required to spend the majority of the shoot
in a small "cell" with his co-star, talking and talking. This is
a story that would have died a slow death if not for its
extensive character development. Fortunately, Hurt's emotional
character is so well-acted that the film has a hypnotic effect in
spite of its restrictive environment.</P>
<P>After the opening credits, the cinematographer gets a chance to
provide the viewer with some eye candy as he completely pans
around the South American prison cell where the characters wile
away their time. Molina is a homosexual thrown in prison for
corrupting a minor. His cellmate, Valentin (Julia), has been
imprisoned for his political activism. Their predicament is not
fun, but Molina (Hurt) tries to make the best of it by talking
endlessly about crappy old movies.</P>
<P>Little happens. This film is a fine example of a character study.
We learn about their lives and sins after the interesting opening
shot. Molina hams it up, fondly remembering those bad movies,
dressing and acting the part of a cliched gay man. However, he's
a sympathetic character from the start and, while he doesn't pull
punches about his homosexuality, he is never obnoxious about it.
Incidentally, Hurt was the first actor to ever win an Oscar for
playing a gay man (Tom Hanks in "Philadelphia" was the only
other).</P>
<P>For the first ten minutes, the two men are introduced to us
through their conversation. Valentin, simply unwilling to listen
to what his cellmate is talking about, is filled with anger and
fear. Their opposite personalities clash until Molina later shows
true compassion for his "partner". A tender scene unfolds when
Valentin is poisoned and becomes badly sick, losing control of
his bowels while still dressed. Director Victor Babenco shows
good taste and restraint here when the flamboyant Molina
undresses him to clean and comfort him. Molina gains both
Valentin's trust and ours when he helps the sick man, but doesn't
try to take advantage of him.</P>
<P>Later, we learn that Molina is working with the warden to get
Valentin to talk about his political contacts. Gaining Valentin's
trust and friendship by sharing food brought by his mother and
taking good care of him while he was sick, Molina begins to
regret his betrayal. He also knew about the attempted poisoning.
Still, he goes through with his treasonous acts in order to get
early parole.</P>
<P>Two difficult scenes called for the men to engage in acts of
passion. At a late juncture in the film, Molina encourages
Valentin to "do what you want with me". We know what happens
off-camera, of course. Handled with tact, this scene was pivotal
to the plot, but it stayed away from exploitation and
offensiveness. The other scene required a kiss between the two
stars. Also done with tenderness and class, this is the last
contact the two friends have in the film. Molina contacts
Valentin's girlfriend when he is released as the warden's
henchman follow in hot pursuit. He is tragically shot to death by
the suspicious girlfriend. The final scene features Valentin,
beaten and tortured in prison, dreaming about being reunited with
his girlfriend.</P>
<P>So, where does the Spider Woman fit in? Well, Sonia Braga plays
three roles: Valetin's girlfriend, the star of Molina's "movies",
and as the Spider Woman. Molina tells a story about a shipwrecked
man comforted and loved by the fictious Spider Woman. This
imagery is strong and well-filmed. Molina dies while in love with
his former cellmate, Valentin is in love with his girlfriend, and
the girlfriend--who is still in love but has given up on her man.</P>
<P>A sensitive movie, Hurt toes the line of over-the-top
flamboyance, yet forces the viewer to forget that he is only
acting. This was Hurt's finest performance (ditto for Julia) and
Hurt was recognized for it when he won the Academy Award. What
really touched me about this film was the similarity between it
and a script I once wrote while in college. My script was also
about two jailed men with mysterious backgrounds and the primary
focus was on good dialogue. Babenco's product was award-worty
and, while mine wasn't, I related to what he was trying to do.</P>
<P>This is one of more underrated prison films ever made. In a muted
manner, it's comparable to one of my favourites, "The Shawshank
Redemption". Not much happens for most of the two hours, but it's
absolutely mesmerizing at times. Calling it slow would be unfair,
but it IS true that "Kiss Of The Spider Woman" probably won't be
appreciated by the average '90s movie fan. It is simple and
intelligent and should be viewed with an open mind, so that the
characters played by Hurt and Julia can be allowed to haunt the
viewer as much as they haunt themselves and each other.</P>
<P>USELESS TRIVIA--William Hurt must be fun to work with. He's
played opposite two Oscar-winning actresses, Marlee Matlin
("Children Of A Lesser God") and Geena Davis ("The Accidental
Tourist"). Holly Hunter, his co-star in "Broadcast News", went on
to win the Best Actress prize for "The Piano" in 1993.</P>
