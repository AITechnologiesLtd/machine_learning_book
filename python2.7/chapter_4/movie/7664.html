<PRE>                              ADDICTED TO LOVE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>It would be difficult to find two more charming actors than Matthew
Broderick and Meg Ryan but it takes more than charm to sustain a
movie.   Somewhere between the reading of the script and getting it on
film, something went a bit wrong; not very much but enough.  The
premise of a young man and woman losing their respective significant
others, only to discover that the "others" they lost are now in love
with each other, certainly sounds as if it would have made a light
romantic comedy.</P>
<P>Sam (Broderick), who is an astronomer in a small midwest town, is a
young romantic. Maggie (Ryan), a New Yorker who has seen enough to make
her wary, is a photographer who by chance meets our astronomer when
both she and he are spying on the two lovers who had jilted them.   The
cynic in Maggie convinces the romantic in Sam that the best way to get
back their respective lovers is by humiliating them.  But how?</P>
<P>Suffice it to say, Sam and Maggie establish themselves in a run-down
loft that just happens to have a one way view into the apartment of
their ex-lovers, Linda (Kelly Preston) and Anton (Tcheky Karyo) where
they sit around watching their exes cavort.     This is where the
movie bogs down.  After a while the spying becomes a bit tiresome but
continues through a good part of the film.  That may have been the
funniest gimmick in the movie but it soon becomes a one- note
gimmick.    That screenwriter Robert Gordon was experienced in breakups
of longtime relationships because he had had one of his own is really
irrelevant.   One would hope his breakup had more humor than does the
story he wrote . . . and that is too bad because whatever entertainment
there is in the film falls mainly on the aforementioned charm of the
two leads, too heavy a burden.</P>
<P>In a cameo, Maureen Stapleton appears as Maggie's mother.</P>
