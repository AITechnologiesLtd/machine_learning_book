<PRE>THE SCHOOL OF FLESH
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Dominique, played stoically by Isabelle Huppert from LA SEPARATION, is a
middle-aged divorcee with a boy toy in Benoît Jacquot's THE SCHOOL OF
FLESH (L' ÉCOLE DE LA CHAIR).  She pays her live-in "lover," Quentin
(Vincent Martinez), but she isn't getting good value for her money.  The
two of them, who evidence no chemistry on the screen, go through the
motions, but not the emotions, of an affair.  They are careful to tell
each other "I love you," but they never convince each other, much less
the audience.</P>
<P>As a lark one night, Dominique goes into a gay bar.  The first time she
sees Quentin tending bar, their eyes lock, and she knows she must have
him.  When it is mentioned that he's a violent type, who earns his rent
by selling his body to men and women alike, she's not dissuaded.  Later,
when told that he has a pile of debts, she doesn't blink an eye.  She
whips out her checkbook and starts retiring them.</P>
<P>Isabelle Huppert creates her rich businesswoman character as a complete
enigma.  Emotion, such as it is, emanates from her rock solid expression
only when tears sporadically fall, as if someone has accidentally
brought an onion onto the set, and she is forced to cry.</P>
<P>Vincent Martinez's acting isn't much better.  He plays an uncaring
rogue, who isn't interesting enough to detest.  "When I'm old, you'll be
dead," he mocks her.  Since the only reason she pays him to live with
her is for the sex, you'd think the sex would be erotic and exciting,
but it is incredibly bland.</P>
<P>The script by Jacques Fieschi, based on a novel by Yukio Mishima, has
exactly one "surprise," but it is so obviously telegraphed that it is an
insult to the viewers' intelligence.  Don't be surprised if your
audience yells out at the screen.</P>
<P>After the setup, the movie quickly gets as stale as a week-old
croissant.  "No man will ever give you what you want," Quentin complains
to Dominique.  Since she reveals so little about herself, Quentin is
probably right.  Spending the entire movie staring off into space, she
certainly doesn't give the audience what it wants with her cold and
aloof performance.</P>
<P>THE SCHOOL OF FLESH runs 1:41.  The film is in French with English
subtitles.  It is rated R for sex, nudity, profanity and dope smoking
and would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
