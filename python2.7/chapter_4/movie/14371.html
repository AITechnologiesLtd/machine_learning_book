<P>   "Urban Legend" follows the conventions of the collegiate
horror movie but it is so well-written, tightly paced and
realistically acted that it rates as the scariest film of its kind
since "Scream."  If "Halloween H20" has turned you off on the
species, have your faith restored with director Jamie Blanks's
work, based on a script by the 24-year-old Silvio Harta.</P>
<P>   The high concept that propels the movie is similar to that of
Jon Amiel's 1995 hit, "Copycat," a similarly tense and visceral
story of a man determined to trod down the same paths as
other serial killers.  In this case, the murderer acts out the
details of urban legends, modern-day folk tales which, like the
Greek tales of past millenia (thinks "Oedipus," "Antigone" and
"Medea,") deal with the untimely end that comes to people to
flout societal (or religious) conventions.  </P>
<P>   While no alligators appear in the sewers of the New
England college (only in New York, remember?), other myths
are cleverly and horrifyingly re-enacted with special touches
for originality.  The fairly banal fable of the woman who put
her wet cat in the microwave oven to dry gets a canine slant
thanks to an adorable West Highland White, while other folk
tales--such as one playing on the severe damage that your
car may suffer if driven over parking-lot spikes and another
about kidneys which are extracted from unwilling victims and
sold on the black market--are given new life with a
vengeance.  What's particularly praiseworthy this time around
is that most of the time an guiltless guy or gal gets tapped
suddenly and without warning on the back, it's not usually an
innocent encounter but a prelude to something gory. </P>
<P>   The story begins in the typical fashion as a car, running out
of gas, traverses a lonely road.  The driver, Pendleton college
student Michele Mancini, reluctanty accepts a tankful of gas
from the frightening attendant (Brad Dourif) whose stuttering
banter petrifies the wits of the coed but turns out--like much of
the rest of the movie--to be other than you think it is.  Michelle
becomes the first victim of the killer's axe, soon to be joined
by a number of others who all have a special connection to
one particular student: we in the audience are challenged to
figure this out thereby exposing the motive and the
perpetrator--all revealed in the penultimate scene.</P>
<P>   "Urban Legend" features Alicia Witt as girl-next-door
Natalie, yet another figure who is not all who she appears to
be.  In fact her criminal background becomes a major clue in
this whodunit horror film.  Ms. Witt is ably supported by an
ensemble of stereotypical college students who spend their
days pursuing more interesting pleasures than their studies. 
The erotic scenes and sexual banter are pumped for their
humor, particularly underscoring college radio broadcaster
Sasha (Tara Reid) whose programming of carnal counsel may
have been modeled from Howard Stern's show.  Practicing
what she preaches, this blond libertine's favorite book is the
Kama Sutra and her motto might well be "willing to try any
and all positions."  But handsome, blue-eyed Jaret Leto is the
Leo Di Caprio guy who, in the role of college journalist Paul,
is likely to bring in the audience of high-school and college
women.  Joshua Jackson as practical joker Damon turns in
the best situation gag of the movie, Robert Englund plays the
kind of professor we all wish we had, and the veddy British
John Neville bring an exceptionally sharp touch to his role as
college dean--the man who hushed up a multiple murder in
the school's Stanley Hall 25 years earlier.</P>
<P>   "Urban Legend" is a young person's motion picture but one
with a mythic resonance likely to appeal to moviegoers of all
ages.  Following its dictates could save your life. For example,
we already know that we should wear weat belts and drive
within the speed limit.  But did you know you could get
yourself killed some night for warning an oncoming car that its
headlights are out?</P>
<PRE>Rated R.  Running time: 97 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten
