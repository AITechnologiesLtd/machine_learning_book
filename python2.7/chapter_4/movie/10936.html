<PRE>Great Expectations</PRE>
<PRE>Dear Caroline --</PRE>
<P>As an English teacher, I'm sure this is one film you've been waiting
for. Like "Clueless" and "Romeo & Juliet," "Great Expectations" is
another modern update of a classic novel. I think, however, this is
the far weaker effort of the three.</P>
<P> The story somewhat follows Charles Dickens' 19th century classic,
right down to the happy ending. But like the other two films, this
version is aimed at the Gen X set, who will end up thinking of this as
the version of record rather than the original on their must-read book
list in high school English class.</P>
<P>My freshman English teacher, Ms. Weinstock, may not like this version
either, barely reminiscent of David Lean's traditional classic 1946
film. This is the fourth feature film version of "Great Expectations,"
but the memorable names have all been changed for some reason by
screenwriter Mitchell Glazer. I remember Ms. Weinstock spent an entire
class demonstrating the importance of Dickens characters' names as
irony. I wish Glazer attended that class.</P>
<P>Dickens' protagonist Pip, which means small seed, made sense since the
novel follows Pip's growth into manhood.  The mysterious Miss
Havisham, conniving and misleading, is literally Having-a-sham against
young Pip.</P>
<P>Throw all of that out the window here. Ethan Hawke plays Finn Bell
(Pip), Anne Bancroft is Ms. Nora Dinsmoor (Miss Havisham), Chris
Cooper is Joe Coleman ("Uncle" Joe Gargery) and Robert De Niro is
Arthur Lustig (Abel Magwitch), an escaped convict who befriends Pip,
ahem, Finn as a 10 year old. Only Finn's love interest, Estella, has
the same name with Gwyneth Paltrow starring. Even attorney Mr. Jaggers
has become Mr. Ragnow.</P>
<P>The focus is clearly on the alluring combination of Hawke and Paltrow
as they exchange glances between a pounding Patrick Doyle score and
songs by Tori Amos and Pulp. "Great Expections' " greatest
contribution will be in CD sales, rather than book sales.</P>
<P>Director Alfonso Cuaron's second American feature is also his second
consecutive remake. That's originality for you. Cuaron debuted in 1995
with "A Little Princess," the remake of "The Little Princess" with
Shirely Temple in 1939.</P>
<P>In this version, orphan Finn Bell (Jeremy James Kissner, at 10) is
startled one day while drawing along the Florida Gulf coast. Lustig
rises out of the water and threatens Finn's life if he doesn't return
with food and bolt cutters for his shackled legs.</P>
<P>The next day Finn is called to the mansion of Ms. Dinsmoor, an
eccentric old hermit who was jilted on her wedding day. Dinsmoor's
niece is the beautiful, young Estella, a bossy snob,who calls Finn,
"the gardener." Finn makes regular visits to the broken-down Dinsmoor
mansion.Finn falls in love.</P>
<P>As revenge, Dinsmoor has taught Estella how to be the ultimate tease,
a real man killer. The worst kind of woman in my book, the type that
knows they're gorgeous, uses it, and then dumps all over you when you
show the least bit of interest. A black widow spider comes to mind,
without the culminating murder.</P>
<P>When a grown-up Finn is approached by a lawyer, preparing to make all
of Finn's wishes come true, Finn is led to believe that his secret
benefactor is Ms. Dinsmoor.</P>
<P>Suddenly, Finn is flying to New York City to make his entry into the
high-profile art world. Estella has already left for school in Europe.</P>
<P>Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki tries hard, but too often Finn is
running or walking through downpours along Big Apple sidewalks. At
least he looks good, but there is little chemistry between Finn and
Estella and for all the beautiful shots, the film lacks charm, energy
and heart.</P>
<P>Lean's film version won a best cinematography Oscar for Guy Green.</P>
<P>A needless voice-over narration provided by Hawke's Finn doesn't
help. Hank Azaria enters the picture as stiff-shirt Walter, Estella's
boyfriend, replacing Dickens' Bentley Drummle from the novel.</P>
<P>You'll have to judge for yourself, though, just so you know what your
students are talking about in class.</P>
<PRE>Rating: Two stars</PRE>
