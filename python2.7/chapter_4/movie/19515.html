<PRE>Ju Dou (1990)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 60</PRE>
<P>Director Zhang Yimou continued the success of
his earlier film "Red Sorghum" with "Ju Dou".
Both films starred actress Gong Li, and eventually
they would make seven films together.  Gong Li
became China's most well-known actress in the
west, while Yimou became the best-known director
from China.  Probably their best collaboration
was 1994's "To Live".</P>
<P>"Ju Dou" is named for Gong Li's character, a
beautiful peasant woman who is purchased by
textile mill owner Yang (Li Wei).  Yang is a
middle-aged man obsessed with having a son, so
as to continue the family dynasty.  But he is
impotent, and takes his frustrations out on
Ju Dou, as he has done with previous wives.
The film is set in China during the 1920s.</P>
<P>Yang has only one worker at his mill.  He is
Tianqing (Li Baotian), a distant nephew of Yang.
Lonely, lifelong bachelor Tianqing quickly falls
for Ju Dou, who turns to him as a protector from
her viciously abusive husband.  Taianqing gives
Ju Dou a child, which Yang believes to be his.
Yang soon becomes crippled, however, allowing
Tianqing and Ju Dou their chance at revenge.
The child, Tianbai (Zheng Jian), grows up believing
Yang to be his father, and lacks the director's
sympathy towards Tianqing's intimacy with
Ju Dou.</P>
<P>The script is sparse, with the story largely told
by cinematography.  The silk tapestries produced
by the mill have bright red and yellow colors, and
are the subject of endless close-ups, more so than
are the actors themselves.</P>
<P>What is the moral of "Ju Dou"?  It is a tragedy
of Shakespearean proportions.  It seems to condemn
the conservative, patrician morality of pre-revolutionary
China.  It suggests that defying that moral code
is not a good idea.  Also, don't beat your wife,
and don't judge your parents.  There may be other
messages as well: certainly "Ju Dou" has something
to say.</P>
<P>There is a death scene in this film that reminds
me of "The Godfather".  Remember Don Corleone having
a heart attack in the vineyards, with his grandson
standing over him and laughing?  The similar scene
here is revisited again, when Tianbai dumps a
passed-out Tianquin into the dye vat.</P>
<PRE>"Ju Dou" received an Oscar nomination for Best
Foreign Language Film.</PRE>
