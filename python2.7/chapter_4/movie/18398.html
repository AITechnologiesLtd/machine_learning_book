<PRE>                     THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN 1999
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1999 Timothy Voon
                    3 out of 4 for a little boy lost</PRE>
<P>Director: Ulu Grosbard
Writer: Stephen Schiff, book by Jacquelyn Mitchard
Cast: Michelle Pfeiffer, Treat Williams, Jonathan Jackson, John Kapelos,
Ryan Merriman, Whoopi Goldberg</P>
<P>It is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has
not experienced the heartache of losing a child – whether that may be in
life or in death. After having said that, I will also say that this
movie does all of the above very well. One gets that choking sensation
in the throat (because of grief) when one brother forgives another for a
costly mistake, or when a husband hugs his wife after a long
estrangement.</P>
<P>There is no ocean, no drownings and it does not conjure up memories of
yet another ‘Ordinary People'. In fact the only thing remotely connected
to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing (not that
this literally happened in the movie). So what are the lessons learnt:
1. Don't take your children to class reunions.
2. Don't leave them alone in the lobby, not even for a second.</P>
<P>Michelle Pfeiffer once again plays the role of a highly-strung wife and
mother, a trend that started with ‘A Thousand Acres' and ‘One Fine Day'.
My comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie, so
much so that when she has a nervous break down, the veins on her temples
bulge impressively. Whoopi Golberg also puts in an understated
performance, playing a lesbian cop, with a name that makes one want to
reach for a lollipop. Lastly, who are the ideal companions for this sort
of movie – my grandmother comes to mind.</P>
