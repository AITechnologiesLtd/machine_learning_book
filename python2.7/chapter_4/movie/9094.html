<PRE>                            THE ASSIGNMENT</PRE>
<P>Based, very loosely I would assume, on the exploits of a mid-East
terrorist dubbed THE JACKAL because of his cold blooded heinous crimes
against civilians.  For the past 20+ years he has bombed and shot
indiscriminately at the helpless while he was in the employ of various
Mid-East and European countries.   Women and children were not spared
by The Jackal whose real name was Carlos Sanchez.    Despite all-out
efforts by our CIA, by Moussad, (the Israeli Secret Service) and other
European countries to capture him, the Jackal managed to elude them .
. . until one fine day.   Imprisoned and given harsh treatment by the
Moussad whose chief, Amos (Ben Kingsley) is fiercely delighted at this
success, it then turns out that the man they are holding only looks
like Sanchez (Aidan Quinn) but is in fact Annibal Ramirez (also played
by Quinn) an officer in the U.S. Navy.    He is awarded little more
than a "Sorry about that" and released.</P>
<P>Shortly thereafter he is approached by Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland) a
high-ranking CIA operative.   Ramirez is told in detail about the
Jackal, shown horrifying photos of maimed children; brought into a
hospital for first-hand viewing of victims.   He is further told that
the Jackal can be caught  only with his cooperation.    Because he
looks exactly like the terrorist, he is being asked to pretend he is
the Jackal while the Israeli and U.S. governments lay a trap.
Ramirez offers all kinds of objections but in the end is talked into
accepting the role.  Thus begins a new life, in its own way a
terrorist life.  He is even asked to be unfaithful to the wife he
loves by persuading the Jackal's girlfriend that he is the Jackal.
Before the Russians (the enemy) can be gulled into the trap, they must
be sure it is indeed the Jackal.</P>
<P>By concentrating on Annibal Ramirez rather than on the terrorist, the
film takes a giant step in the right direction.    Adding to the
believability of the story are the fine performances by the three
leads.   Kingsley, tense and determined; Sutherland with a kind of
smirk; and Quinn doing double duty (but very little as the terrorist)
mostly as the clean-cut Naval officer who almost loses himself in the
terrorist role in order to be believable to the enemy.</P>
<P>Others in the cast include Liliana Komorowska, Celine Bonnier, Claudia
Ferri,  Vlasta Vrana, Von Flores and Al Waxman.</P>
<PRE>A very exciting film.  Very well written by Dan Gordon and Sabi H
Shabtai.</PRE>
<PRE>                    Directed by Christian Duguay.</PRE>
