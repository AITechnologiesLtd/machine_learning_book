<PRE>                           THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD 
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD tells the true
          story of the nearly amorous, sometimes-touching,
          relationship of a lackluster school teacher and a
          mother-dominated pulp fiction writer in West Texas
          in the 1930s.  What gives the story its interest is
          that the writer is Robert E. Howard, the creator of
          Conan, King Kull, and Solomon Kane.  This is a
          well-textured observation of two very different
          personalities in a story of contrasts: the
          difference in personalities of the two main
          characters, the difference in their writing styles,
          and the differences between Howard and the
          characters about whom he wrote.  This slow-paced
          film will not be to all tastes, but it creates its
          period and tells us a great deal about writing in
          general. Rating: high +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     In 1934 Robert E. Howard's friends called him "the best pulp
writer in the whole wide world."  These days that title would more
likely go to Edgar Rice Burroughs or H. P. Lovecraft.  However, in some
order, the next two names probably would be Walter Gibson and Robert
E. Howard.  Howard invented the popular genre of fantasy novel today
called "Sword and Sorcery."  His most popular character is, of course,
Conan of Cimmeria (a.k.a. Conan the Barbarian) who with a powerful
sword and a rudimentary intelligence fights the powers of Black Magic
in a prehistoric world of monsters and sorcerers.  (Of course, the
sword was made more powerful and the intelligence more rudimentary in
the 1982 John Milius film CONAN THE BARBARIAN and its 1984 sequel CONAN
THE DESTROYER, both starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.) But THE WHOLE WIDE
WORLD is not the story of larger-than-life people and huge mystical
events, it is more whimper than bang.  In 1934 a schoolteacher and
aspiring writer, Novalyne Price, met and got to know Bob Howard.  Years
later, in probably the only piece of her writing that ever got any
attention, she told the story of that friendship in a memoir entitled
ONE WHO WALKED ALONE.  That memoir is the basis of THE WHOLE WIDE
WORLD.</P>
<P>     Price (played by Renee Zellweger who currently also has the co-
starring role in JERRY MAGUIRE) is introduced to Howard (Vincent
D'Onofrio) by a mutual friend.  Most of the town of Cross Plains in
rural West Texas think of Howard as being a little strange and
unbalanced.  The truth is that most of the town is probably right.
Howard's life, other than his writing, is owned and jealously guarded
by his sickly mother. Howard takes care of his mother is some ways that
are more personal than most sons would and most of his world revolves
around his mother.  His one outlet is his typewriter where he turns
what are little more than expanded adolescent fantasies into adventure
prose, often shouting out that prose as he writes a story.  Price
intrudes on the relationship between the Howard and his mother to make
friends with the twenty-eight-year- old writer.  She maintains a
relationship that goes little beyond the platonic with the stocky
child-man.  She herself would like to be a good writer in the classic
sense and has a hard time telling Howard that he should aspire to
writing more than his swaggering fantasies.</P>
<P>     The great irony, of course, but one that the narrative never
admits except by its very existence, is that Price is 180 degrees
wrong.  There can be as much art to writing an adolescent fantasy
really well as there can be to describing the real world.  Her own
well-observed description of her dating period is of interest only in
that it sheds light on the forces that formed the pulp fiction she
looked down upon.  On the other hand Howard perhaps in innocence never
doubted that his swaggering stories were the gull-darnedest best
writing around.  And he was, in fact, writing a literature that once it
was rediscovered in the 1960s would never be out of print and would be
an inspiration to generations of writers.  Price's position in the
world of literature today is as a footnote, remembered as the woman who
dated Howard and whose reminiscences gave us a look into his personal
life.  This subtext is more of interest than the actual text of the
film.</P>
<P>     Vincent D'Onofrio is already establish as one of our better
feature actors.  Since he played the doomed Private Pyle in FULL METAL
JACKET he has had an enviable succession of character roles.  Renee
Zellweger is a graduate of horror films who has lucked into having two
star-making roles (JERRY MAGUIRE being the other) on the screen in one
Christmas season.  This is Dan Ireland's first time directing, though
he has produced, or executive-produced, such diverse films as the 1988
film TWISTER, PAPERHOUSE, and WHORE.  He does a reasonable job, though
fails to keep the characters consistently interesting.  Occasionally he
goes in for some hammy photography tricks like crudely darkening a
strip at the top of the screen to create the effect of a darkened sky.</P>
<P>     It is not clear that this film really stands well on its own.  If
it were a work of fiction it would just be a story of the dating
between two people who were not really very interesting in the final
analysis.  THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD gives little feel for the sort of
stories that Howard was writing at the time, except for their
overwhelming silliness and juvenility.  And certainly the stories will
bear that interpretation.  Where the story gets its real impetus is not
from the endings that Price sees in the story, but in the beginnings
that she does not appreciate.  I give this film a high +1 on the -4 to
+4 scale.</P>
