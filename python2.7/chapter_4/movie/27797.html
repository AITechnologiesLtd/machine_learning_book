<PRE>3000 MILES TO GRACELAND
-----------------------</PRE>
<P>Murphy (Kevin Costner) is a hard boiled criminal who believe's he's the
illegitimate son of Elvis.  His former cellmate Michael (Kurt Russell) has
agreed to meet him at the Last Chance motel outside of Las Vegas to pull
off a unique heist.  Murphy, Michael and Murphy's recruits Hanson (Christian 
Slater), Gus (David Arquette, "Ready to Rumble") and Franklin (Bokeem
Woodbine, "The Rock") will become color coded Elvis impersonators under
cover of the chaos of International Elvis week to rob the Riviera Hotel 
and Casino in "3000 Miles to Graceland."</P>
<P>Music video director/cowriter (with Richard Recco) Demian Lichtenstein begins
things snappily with his opening credit sequence of giant black (symbolizing
Murphy) and white (Michael's standin) computer generated scorpion-robots
battling in the desert to driving hard rock.  This clever bit of imagery
morphs into live action as Michael arrives at the Last Chance.  There he
meets 'Cybil with a C' (Courtney Cox Arquette, TV's 'Friends'), single mother
of young kleptomaniac son Jesse (David Kaye, "Legends of the Fall").  Jesse
steals Michael's custom lug nuts off his 59' cherry red Cadillac, Cybil
returns them then quickly maneuvers Michael into the sack.</P>
<P>Murphy and his gang arrive, pick up Michael, and perform their daring heist
to the tune of $3.2 million.  Unplanned is the massive body count left
behind before the arrival of their escape helicopter on the building's rooftop.
Unknown was Murphy's intent to murder his colleagues before heading north
to launder the loot.  A bulletproof vest worn by Michael and that stealing
habit of Jesse's change Murphy's plans while Michael finds himself on the
run with a woman he doesn't trust and her precocious son.</P>
<P>"3000 Miles to Graceland" is a pretty flashy ride, but suffers from shallow
characterizations and an over-the-top ending (think "Con Air").  Lichtenstein
mostly uses his music video background to good effect, only occasionally
overstepping the line between feature filmmaking and imagery that should have
been left on MTV.  Technically, the film is slick, particularly in the shooting
and editting of the early heist scene (cinematography by David Franco ("The 
Whole Nine Yards") who moves his camera up one side of a subject, over it and
downside the other; editing by Michael J. Duthie ("Stigmata") and Miklos
Wright).  </P>
<P>Lichtenstein is less successful with his writing.  It's hinted that Murphy
is conflicted in his feelings for 'the King,' his purported father, but
Lichtenstein doesn't go deep enough.  Similarly, Michael is too much of a
'good' bad guy - he knocks guards out and shoots glass partitions out to
slow down pursuers while his colleagues are massacring everyone in site -
yet we're given no back story as to why he spent over five years in jail 
and why he's aligned himself with Murphy in the first place.  Cybil is
written as more of a plot device than a character.</P>
<P>The principal actors try to flesh out their characters, though.  Costner
is effective as a real evil villain - clearly he's having some fun with this
role.  Courtney Cox Arquette takes a shallow role and really runs with it.
Russell is appealing, but the least successful at defining his character.</P>
<P>Thomas Haden Church (TV's 'Wings') puts a droll spin on Marshall Quigley,
the man on Murphy's tail.  Peterson, the Idaho money launderer, is given
the usual oily/whiny Jon Lovitz routine.</P>
<P>"3000 Miles to Graceland" is a fairly entertaining film that begins with
a bang and ends with too much contrivance.</P>
