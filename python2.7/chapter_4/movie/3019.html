<PRE>                                LOVE AFFAIR
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1994 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     LOVE AFFAIR is an example of a film actually improved by its
marketing.  The film is a remake of the classic tear-jerker AN AFFAIR
TO REMEMBER, which played so prominent a role in SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE
(which was, in a way, another remake.)  The plot has not aged well;
the roles of women and men (not to mention the position of the
differently-abled) have changed enough in forty years so that the pride
that drives the final scene doesn't make much sense anymore.</P>
<P>     So the film is badly flawed, but by playing up the movie's
relation to their real-life love affair and marriage Warren Beatty and
Annette Bening have improved it quite a bit. One is supposed to
understand from this film the deep affection Beatty felt for Bening,
which led him to finally settle down with her.  Beatty's acting range
is so limited that I did not think this came across, but the mere
casting of Bening in this role, when she is somewhat past her prime
(appropriately, given the context, but strikingly against tradition for
Hollywood) makes one understand his feelings for her much more than his
unchanging expression ever could.</P>
<P>     There are really only three or four significant characters n the
film:  Beatty, Bening, Katherine Hepburn, and Gary Shandling, who plays
Beatty's character's agent, in the exact style of his character from
the Larry Saunders show.</P>
<P>     I found Hepburn's performance quite striking, easily the best in
the film.  I do not think I have ever seen an old person played as
simply and directly as here. It is quite daring to do this, because
everyone will assume that she is simply playing herself. Perhaps she
is, but we must also remember that she is a fine and experienced
actress.</P>
<P>     There are some nice travel shots.  Tahiti is beautiful.  I would
say that taking a Russian cruise ship on a tour of the South Pacific
looks like a nice way to spend a vacation.</P>
<P>     In summary, the film is pretty badly flawed, and not worth the
build-up it was given by its marketing, but it is far better than many
critics (who must be comparing it with AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER) have been
saying.  It's entertaining, it has a nice solid romantic feeling and a
singular performance by Katherine Hepburn.</P>
