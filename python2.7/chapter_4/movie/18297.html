<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
4 stars</P>
<P>One might describe Lolita as simply a road movie with a pedophile and a
young girl - at least, that would be the easy way of explaining it.
There is a bad taste that lingers all through this film; even in its
sweetened moments, there is a sense that nothing will end righteously.
Behind the films characters and behind its doomed central romance, there
is a cynical but simultaneously passionate depiction of the nature of
forbidden love.  Director Adrian Lyne takes a lengthy amount of time
building the relationship between his two protagonists, before coming in
for the kill in the last forty-five or so minutes of the film.  He molds
the bad taste into an immoral atmosphere, all the while making sure that
the sins he examines are told in an engaging and profound manner.  The
result is an enticing and literate mixture of triumph and disaster,
sorrow and pleasure.  Told with subtlety and elegance, Lolita is a
gentle but expressive experience, and one that is portrayed vividly and
openly.</P>
<P>You can bet your bottom dollar that no film this year will have created
as much controversy as this one.  With the large amount of media
spotlight on the film, it's almost as if seeing Lolita is a crime - and
for all the wrong reasons.  I don't understand why many individuals and
organizations were so intent on having the film banned - do they think
that if we ignore the issue of pedophilia, it will go away?  As my
colleague Peter Thompson explained on the Sunday TV program, "if Lolita
discourages even one person from pursuing his or her desires at the
expense of another person, of any age, it will have more than justified
itself."  And justified itself it has.  I don't believe that Lolita
encourages pedophilia at all - it really discourages it, since the film
ends with a painful and heart-breaking tragedy, which is one of the
foremost reasons to see it.</P>
<P>Professor Humbert Humbert (Jeremy Irons) is a quaint middle aged
pedophile, and he's not a monster or a freak as many screen pedophiles
are.  Humbert fell head over heals in love as a teenager, and the death
of his girl friend at a young age marred him for life.  So much so, that
he has never stopped searching for her.  As he matured, his romantic
interests did not, so when he stumbles upon the beautiful 14 year old
Dolores "Lolita" Haze (Dominique Swain) he is instantly mesmerized.
Humbert lodges in the home of Lolita's mother Charlotte Haze (Melanie
Griffith) and then marries her, just to stay close to his true object of
affection.</P>
<P>When Charlotte is conveniently removed from their lives, Humbert and
Lolita's relationship advances.  Lolita realizes the manipulative power
she has over Humbert, and what began as meaningless flirting
materializes into a contingency of sexual manipulation.  As Humbert
becomes obsessed by the seductive young girl, he takes away from her the
very thing he was attracted to - her innocence.</P>
<P>Jeremy Irons is perfectly cast as professor Humbert, a character whose
every action needed to performed with a weighty but gentle presence.
Irons fulfills that criteria beautifully, and gives a performance that's
virtually faultless.  Every look and every move that Humbert makes is
carried with subtle expression and gorgeous artistry; Jeremy Irons is
completely convincing and incredibly moving.  I wouldn't hesitate to say
that he is one of the best actors working today.   On the other side of
the spectrum - in age, and in experience - Dominique Swain (who appeared
in John Woo's Face/Off) is fine.  She animates Lolita with needed
energy, and only ever looks slightly unconvincing in her final scene
(though the damage made is minimal).  Together, Irons and Swain make an
obliging screen couple, although their togetherness is intentionally
never entirely comfortable to watch.</P>
<P>Stephen Schiff's screen adaptation of the classic novel by Vladimir
Nabokov retains its literacy and coherency.  The film never adds
subplots for the sake of having subplots - everything is edited
precisely and its key scenes never run too long.  The photography by
Howard Atherton provides some nice visual touches, especially in the
final few scenes that, together, provide a disturbingly provocative
climax.  Shot, edited and performed with elegance, Lolita is a powerful
and artistic film with a grim core.  Ignore the droves of people who
condemn it, and listen to those who take it seriously - Lolita is a
painfully beautifully piece that, aside from the controversy it has
gathered, is really not about politics at all - its about a relationship
that cannot feasibly end happily.</P>
