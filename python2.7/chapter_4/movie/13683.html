<PRE>starring Thomas Jay Ryan, James Urbaniak, Parker Posey, Maria Porter

<P>It is often said by his fans that Hal Hartley movies are an acquired
taste. Indeed. While perhaps less dangerous
than tequila shooters or bungee-jumping, they require no less amount of
physical stamina and concentration. I felt
rewarded at the end of HENRY FOOL; this movie creeps up on you-at a slow
139 minutes, I mean creeps-and
despite the final shot's ambiguity, I left completely satisfied.</P>
<P>Henry Fool ("used to have an ‘e'") arrives at garbageman Simon Grim's
house, claims the vacant basement
apartment, and almost instantly inspires Simon (Urbaniak) to take up
writing-Henry (Martin Donovan look-alike
Ryan) is an ex-convict, a once-great author who has been "exiled and
marginalized" by the publishing community
because of his criminal activity. Simon's poetry turns him into a local
sensation, as it causes mute women to sing,
high-school girls to swoon, and councilmen to rile against its
"pornographic" content. Meanwhile, Henry seduces
both Simon's dependent mother (Porter) and immature sister (Sundance
Queen Posey) with philosophical babble
(which is by turns brilliant and inane) and breathy animal lust. These
story elements result in climaxes both
inevitable and unpredictable; the teacher-student relationship formed
between Henry and Simon eventually
reverses itself.</P>
<P>HENRY FOOL is sprinkled with Hartley-ian flourishes: Simon drinks milk
from "Udderley's"; the big teen
hang-out is called "World of Donuts"; Simon wears his garbageman's
uniform throughout; the editing style is
decidedly elliptical... (which is key to the conclusion's said
ambiguity). The performances by the three leads are
abrasive at first, self-consciously "quirky"; the introductory scenes
are a chore. These people do grow on you
because they convey genuine passion, a belief in themselves, and because
they have long-term goals; Henry and
Simon may drink a lot of Budweiser and hang out on the streetcorner, but
they aren't pop slackers. The story is
rather classical: the tutor is a better talker than a doer, raised on
books; the timid tutee has innate talent his master
only dreams of. (Shades of film school...) The finished film is epic in
its proportions for a story so small, and the final
third does test one's patience, yet HENRY FOOL is tight, hardly
excessive in its length. How refreshing to see a
movie this long in 1998 devoted entirely to character. And unless I
nodded off, not a single building exploded.</P>
<P>This, Hartley's seventh feature, is contemplative about "the artist";
fortunately, we never get a sampling of
Simon's work, and it's a testament to the actors and the screenplay that
by the end we can surmise what sort of
thoughts would pour from these writers' pens.</P>
