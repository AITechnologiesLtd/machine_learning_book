<PRE>                                   SHINE 
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: SHINE is a study of the shattered
          life of a child prodigy pianist whose father, a
          Holocaust survivor, totally dominated and
          controlled.  While the film is supposed to be
          uplifting in that David Helfgott could salvage
          something of his life, it still seems to be
          pitifully poor consolation and a tragic waste of a
          life and of talent.  Rating: +1 (-4 to +4)  There
          are some minor spoilers in the plot description.</PRE>
<P>     SHINE is a true story, a biography of a sort of local celebrity in
Australia.  The man is eccentric to the point of being nearly autistic
but is also a brilliant pianist.  David Helfgott is a man with many
personal demons, some real and some imagined, who was a musical prodigy
but could not face the pressures that a musical career placed on him.
The greatest of all the pressures came from his father, a man of huge
rages who wanted to control David like he would control a puppet.</P>
<P>     As SHINE opens, we see David as just another schizoid wandering a
city street like you might see in any big city.  He is seen staring in
at a small wine bar after closing time.  The staff at first sees him as
trouble, but find his quick staccato conversation endearing.  They
decide to give him a ride home.  From there film flashes back to
David's youth to show us the forces that created this apparent human
wreckage.  David is the son of Peter Helfgott, a Polish Jew whose
entire family was murdered in the Holocaust.  Peter survived, but
hardly intact.  Emotionally blasted by his loses he irrationally holds
his new family in an iron grip.  Out of an irrational fear of losing
these new loved ones he refuses them the freedom of making any
decisions for themselves, least of all decisions that may take them
away from him.  Peter Helfgott treats the members of his family as
something between objects and pets.  Criticism and even blows are
administered on a daily basis while praise is reserved only for the
most special of occasions.  David, who has never known any other
treatment accepts it and considers it natural.  And through this
treatment he is able to become an exceptional talent as a pianist,
perhaps even brilliant.  In spite of his family's low income and the
crude facilities available locally, David is able to prove his talent
in competition and even comes to the attention of the great Isaac
Stern.  But any attempt that David makes to go someplace to develop his
talent is vetoed by his father.  The film follows David as eventually
he does get away and makes an effort to develop his great talent, but
the struggle to escape his father has already too far weakened him and
taken too much of a toll.</P>
<P>     What is interesting in the film is the affect that music has on
David.  As a boy music is a negative influence on him, dragging him
down into the strange psychological state he eventually reaches.  He is
eventually even forbidden to play the piano for fear of the effect it
will have on him.  Yet the same music is also what pulls him out of
that slump, returning some semblance of a life and even a career to
him.  Also remarkable is how people seem to keep finding David
endearing.  In spite of his many problems and the infinite patience
that is required for dealing with him, the adult David seems to have
the charm somehow to attract admirers and people who are willing to
care for him.  The adult David strikes one as having an intelligent,
but uncontrolled mind.  He talks as fast as his fingers move playing
the Rachmaninoff Third Piano Concerto, but he jumps from idea to idea
and drops each for the next.</P>
<P>     Top billing ironically goes to Armin Mueller-Stahl who plays Peter
Helfgott.  Mueller-Stahl is a good actor with a single
characterization, but he rarely varies from that characterization and
shows any breadth in his acting ability.  The reason that the actor
playing David does not get top billing is because it is shared among
three actors: Alex Rafalowicz playing David as a boy, Noah Taylor plays
him as a teenager, and Geoffrey Rush plays the adult version.  Rush
seems to be getting the most attention for the role, but all three are
interesting actors.  Other recognizable actors include John Gielgud,
Lynn Redgrave, and Googie Withers.  (Gielgud this year alone has been
in GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, LOOKING FOR RICHARD, SHINE, THE PORTRAIT OF A
LADY, and HAMLET, in addition to doing voices in DRAGONHEART and THE
LEOPARD SON.  It is nice to see that he can find work!)</P>
<P>     While it is possible to see this as a story of triumph over great
odds, it seems like a weak triumph.  It will be hard for most viewers
to see much to admire in the adult David who must seems so incredibly
hard to control.  It seems like a small victory, and may leave the
viewer a little dissatisfied with this as a story of redemption.  I
rate SHINE a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     Just an afterthought: In part where SHINE falls down is in its
allusion to what much of its audience will see as a mystery about great
musical performances.  It does not make clear to the audience just what
makes one musical performance great.  Any good record store will have
two or three recordings of the "Rach 3."  Presumably each of these will
have every note that Rachmaninoff wrote, played exactly as the composer
specified.  And presumably the same is true of Helfgott's performance.
The filmmaker knows that there is great variation in these performances
but besides showing some (silent) sweat on David's brow and showing his
emotional agony as he plays, the film leaves as a total mystery why
David's is a performance more to be prized than any one of the many
others.  I am not sure I know the answer to this question and it
certainly is something very germane to the film.  The script dangles
this very central issue in front of the viewer but makes little attempt
to answer it.</P>
