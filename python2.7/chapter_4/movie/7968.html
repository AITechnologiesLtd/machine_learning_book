<PRE>                        MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING
                       A film review by Ted Prigge
                        Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: P.J. Hogan
Writer: Ronald Bass
Starring: Julia Roberts, Dermot Mulroney, Cameron Diaz, Rupert Everett, 
M. Emmet Walsh, Paul Giamatti</P>
<P>With "Batman and Robin" opening the same weekend of this, you'd think 
this "Julia Roberts comeback for good film" wouldn't stand a chance.  
Wrong.  When people go see it and see it sucks unbelievably much, 
they'll race to see this comic gem.  That's what it is.  And I'm not 
saying that 'cause I saw both of them the same weekend...I saw this one 
first, man.</P>
<P>Julia's big ice-breaker into the world of mega-celebrity-hood was 
"Pretty Woman" which was cool at first but kinda lost its glamour and 
just became a good old three-star film that you can recite.  This one 
may not be recitable, but it's far better.</P>
<P>Julia plays restaurant food critic, Julianne Potter, a highly neurotic, 
insecure girl who has a nervous breakdown when she realizes that pact 
she made with her male best friend, Michael (Dermot Mulroney), to get 
married at 28 if they aren't already, might come up, for her 28th is 
soon and she just got a message from him saying he NEEDS to talk to her. 
 But it's worse than that - he's getting married in 4 days (why he 
didn't tell her...).  She falls off the bed and decides to go down there 
and sabotage the marriage and marry Michael since she now realizes she's 
been in love with him all along.</P>
<P>But her target of sabotage is tough - she's little Miss Perfect with 
sympathy, a "Kimmy" Wallace (the wonderful Cameron Diaz), who is madly 
in love with Michael, despite the fact he loves the following: action 
movies, karaoke bars, etc.  Every time she tries to make Michael hate 
Kimmy, he ends up loving her more.  She drags them to a karaoke bar and 
forces Kimmy (who claims to not be able to carry a tune) to sing.  She 
sucks embarrassingly but soon gets into it and Michael and her make out 
there in front of Julianne.</P>
<P>The funniest section of the film is when Julianne calls her new best 
friend, her gay editor, George (the oscar-nomination worthy Rupert 
Everett), to help her out.  She tries to make Michael jealous by saying 
he's her fiance, but George gets her back by playing it up 
embarrassingly for her, but later adds to the depth of the film towards 
the end.</P>
<P>The films is great because it's an evil comedy and it knows it.  It asks 
us to question whether or not we should root for Julianne by making 
Kimmy a sympathetic person.  She's apt to cry and when she does, we hope 
Julianne doesn't do anything further to destroy their union.  But Julia 
is so likable that this becomes a huge conflict.  It's resolved nicely, 
I think, in an anti-Hollywood way.  This film gleefully toys with us by 
walking right up to the hokey Hollywood line, then making a U-Turn.  </P>
<P>All the performances are magnificent.  The four leads are all great in 
their own way and it's tough to say who runs away with the film.  It's 
definitely not Dermot, who's great and all, but not as much as the 
others.  But is it Cameron Diaz, who's perfect in making her perfect yet 
with flaws and sympathy?  Is it Rupert Everett, who's so funny and such 
a good scene-stealer AND makes the "gay best friend" so much NOT like 
the typical "gay best friend?"  Or is it the top-billed Julia Roberts, 
who makes neuroticism seem fashionable?  </P>
<P>I don't know.  Really I don't.  It may as well be a three-way tie.  But 
the film as a whole works great.  The direction by Aussie director P.J. 
Harvey ("Muriel's Wedding") is wonderfully clever and even adds some 
good old Aussie campiness - i.e. the opening credits and the Dionne 
Warwick sing-along at a lunch scene (led by Rupert).  </P>
<P>Overall, this is the thinking man's romantic comedy and a contender for 
the best of that genre for the decade, along with "Four Weddings and a 
Funeral" and "Sleepless in Seatle."  So if you saw "Batman and Robin" or 
don't even want to (it's worth a viewing at least, even if it bites), go 
see this fantastically wonderful film.</P>
