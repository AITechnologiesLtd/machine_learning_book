<PRE>FLUBBER</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: ** (out of ****) </PRE>
<P>Walt Disney / 1:32 / 1997 / PG (mild innuendo, slapstick violence)
Cast: Robin Williams; Marcia Gay Harden; Christopher McDonald; Jodie 
Benson (voice); Raymond J. Barry; Clancy Brown; Ted Levine; Wil 
Wheaton; Edie McClurg 
Director: Les Mayfield 
Screenplay: John Hughes; Bill Walsh </P>
<P>"Flubber" is the latest in a recent scattershot trend of Disney 
self-remakes, but despite Robin Williams in the lead role and all the 
gooey special effects money can buy, it's something a flub itself. 
Pretty much any family-oriented holiday release starring Williams is 
guaranteed to have lengthy staying power (think "Jumanji" and "Mrs. 
Doubtfire"), but this surprisingly low-energy update of Fred 
MacMurray's 1961 "The Absent-Minded Professor" never realizes its 
gooey potential. Flubber lacks the deliciously campy energy that Glenn 
Close brought last year's "101 Dalmatians," but perhaps we can all 
give thanks it's not as dreadful as spring's "That Darn Cat." </P>
<P>Williams plays college professor Phillip Brainard, a foggy-minded 
genius who has twice forgotten wedding dates with his sweetheart Sara 
Jean (Marcia Gay Harden) because of his preoccupation with a possible 
scientific breakthrough. Another nuptial ceremony is going down the 
toilet as the movie opens, a disaster aided this time by Brainard's 
flying, talking, enamored laptop WEEBO. Reminiscent of those mini-UFOs 
from Steven Spielberg's "* batteries not included," WEEBO would like 
Phillip all to herself and resorts to devious trickery to keep his 
relationship with Sara Jean on the edge of disaster -- kind of a kinky 
love triangle. </P>
<P>Phillip's eventual invention of flying rubber is immediately dubbed 
Flubber, a lime Jell-O ball of goo with a mind of its own and a 
penchant for all sorts of bouncy mischief -- mischief that gets it 
noticed by the hired thugs (Ted Levine and Clancy Brown) of the 
college's scheming bankroller Chester Hoenicker (Raymond J. Barry, 
doing his best Christopher Walken impersonation). Hoenicker is already 
after Phillip for flunking his son, and by stealing Flubber he can 
even capitalize off of his revenge. But Flubber isn't the most 
agreeable substance, as he will soon find out. </P>
<P>A lot of "Flubber"'s troubles can be attributed to too little manic 
humor and too much physical shtick. Perhaps co-screenwriter/producer 
John Hughes deserves a large part of the finger-shaking, because 
"Flubber" contains large doses of the same lame conked-on-the-noggin 
slapstick that wasn't all that funny in "Home Alone," let alone its 
employment in most of his films since. Kids will be delighted by all 
of the comedic bodily harm to be sure, but they may roll their eyes 
when Phillip hops in his Flubber-powered '63 Thunderbird and soars 
serenely through the skies. It might have been charming in "The 
Absent-Minded Professor," but now it's rather dull seeing as how cars 
fly in every third Hollywood flick. </P>
<P>Williams can be an effective semi-straight man when he's given someone 
to bounce jokes off him (see his turn as Nathan Lane's subdued better 
half in "The Birdcage"), but here he has nobody. It's rare that he's 
allowed to cut loose; funny scenes like a Flubber test session on a 
basketball court demonstrate how little life there is in the rest of 
the film. Harden is extremely pleasant, but the snoozy Sara Jean is no 
match for WEEBO; Christopher McDonald, as a potential beau for her, is 
reduced to shooting the green stuff out of his rear in a bout of 
freaky Flubber flatulence. It is nice, however, to see co-stars Edie 
McClurg and Wil Wheaton acting again after their expired stints on 
"The Hogan Family" and "Star Trek: The Next Generation," respectively. </P>
<P>"Flubber" has its moments, but they are few and far between. With both 
Williams' antics and the number of magical moments severely lacking, 
the relatively brief running time of 92 minutes creaks by fairly slow. 
But at least the movie has an interesting, uh, character in WEEBO (the 
professor's sidekick was a dog in the original). Brought to life by 
the sweet voice of "The Little Mermaid"'s Jodie Benson, this robotic 
personal assistant acts effectively as both a day planner and a secret 
admirer, and is given a lot more personality than any of the human 
cast. I want a WEEBO of my own for Christmas. As far as everything 
else is concerned, somebody hand me the Goo-Be-Gone. </P>
