FIRST LOVE, LAST RITES
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     In what for most people would be the perfect romantic fantasy, two 
lithe, young lovers in their early twenties drag a mattress over to the 
open window in FIRST LOVE, LAST RITES.  With their hormones raging, they 
spend the day and on into the bright orange sunset making love.  
Completely nude, their bodies intertwine into one in a sexual ballet 
that director Jesse Peretz cuts much too short.</P>
<P>     As Sissel, TWO GIRLS AND A GUY's Natasha Wagner uses her deeply 
penetrating eyes to seduce the camera.  Oozing sex from every pore, she 
is perfectly cast the film's female lead.  When she gives her mate the 
"come hither" look, he obeys without question.  She has him on such a 
tight leash that he's willing to follow her every command, whether it be 
getting his fingernails painted different pastel colors or going to the 
graveyard at night to get a moontan.  Aluminum foil under the neck 
ensures that their tans are uniform.</P>
<P>     Much less successful is the casting of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN's 
Giovanni Ribisi as Sissel's lover, Joey, a Brooklyn guy in town on 
vacation.  His bleary eyes have the constant look of someone recovering 
from a bad hangover.  Sissel is Joey's "first," but Sissel seems quite 
experienced.  When Joey just turns over the lovemaking to Sissel, the 
picture comes alive with a raw sexual energy that most films are afraid 
of.  (The sex isn't that explicit, but it is intensely natural.)</P>
<P>     Much less successful is the rest of the movie, especially the 
subplot of Joey's teaming up with Sissel's father to become rich by 
trapping the eels in the Louisiana Bayou, where the story is set.  (The 
locale raises the temperature nicely, providing the steamy atmosphere 
which filmmakers prefer for filming sex scenes.)</P>
<P>     Another subplot deals with Sissel's many quirks, not the least of 
which is her obsession with boiling her vinyl records.  (The film is set 
in the mid-70s, but little is made of the fact and at least one car from 
the 90s is prominently featured in one of the scenes.)</P>
<P>     Other parts, such as the rat in the walls, have metaphorical 
meanings that most viewers will not attempt to figure out.</P>
<P>     Like two kids playing house, the two young lovers go frequently to 
Sissel's shack built on stilts.  Their intimacy and the beauty of their 
lovemaking saves the picture, even if just barely.</P>
<P>     FIRST LOVE, LAST RITES runs just 1:33.  It is rated R for sex and 
nudity, and would be fine for older teenagers.</P>
