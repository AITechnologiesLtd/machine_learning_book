<P>In 1987, Charlie Sheen's character in WALL STREET asked his mentor Gordon
Gekko "how much was enough?". Gekko responded: "It's not a question of
enough, pal. It's a zero sum game, somebody wins, somebody loses. Money
itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to
another." A great film for the 80s, but with day-trading, dot-com mania and
a bullish market running rampant today, the question that now plagues the
gang in this similarly themed flick is "how far would you go?". And what I
want to know is...does greed still work?</P>
<P>PLOT:
A young man caught between an overbearing father and his lust for the big
money, gets a plush gig at an off-Wall Street brokerage house, and quickly
becomes one of their top men on the phones. Unfortunately for the young lad,
he soon discovers that the firm itself isn't as kosher as he was originally
told.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Just call it GLENGARRY GLENROSS JR. or the SON OF WALL STREET since this
film is nothing more than a modern-day remake of these two great films with
some hipper-than-thou dialogue tossed around for kicks, an over-the-top rap
soundtrack and several strong performances from its young cast of male
hotshots. Giovanni Ribisi is one who has also been known as a solid actor in
my neck of the woods, but hopefully this starring gig will get him the
widespread recognition that he deserves. Ben Affleck pulls an "Alec Baldwin
in Glengarry" cameo as the tough-as-nails supervisor who comes in every now
and again and busts everybody's balls with a solid delivery and fun style.
It's pretty obvious from his demeanor that he just loved playing this role!
And boy, did he have some doozy lines to deliver. Vin Diesel is another
standout as the man on the inside who kind of takes Ribis under his wing
when he first joins the mini-Billionaire Boys Club. In fact, I would say
that it was probably the combination of the great cast, tasty dialogue and
interesting professional milieu that made this film so much more
entertaining for me. Mind you, I have a background and degree in business,
so there may be some bias on my part here : )</P>
<P>Now if you're looking for an original story, well this film just ain't for
you. This tale follows the standard premise of any film which has the
sympathetic innocent character from the outside being pulled into a (what
seems like) once in a lifetime opportunity, only to find out that it's
actually not as great an opportunity as once led to believe. This film tries
to add some feelers with a back-story about Ribisi's cold hearted dad
affecting his behavior, which only slightly worked for me, and the fruition
of a romance between Ribi and a secretary, which should just have been left
on the cutting room floor, but all in all, I was entertained throughout this
film and thoroughly enjoyed the open references to the former films
mentioned above. One thing I still don't understand is how studios keep
trying to satisfy the most common denominator in films like this by adding a
token romance for the obvious female target crowd, when in reality all that
they are doing is taking the focus away from an interesting story set inside
a highly toxic male testosterone environment. Stick to the story at hand
folks, and they will come! Anyway, I still don't think that this film will
particularly appeal to the female demographic since the focus of the film is
basically on a bunch of spoiled, loud, brash, erect male penises out to make
a million, but then again, does that really sound inviting to anyone? Well,
I certainly enjoyed it plenty and it sure does give you a little more
insight into the mighty worlds of cold-callers and stock dealers. So if you
like all that sales lingo, don't mind the basic storyline, love the actors
and enjoy well-written dialogue, then by all means, put this film on your
list of to do's over the next weekend or so.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Actors Vin Diesel and Giovanni Ribisi co-starred alongside one another in
Spielberg's 1998 war drama SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (8/10). Diesel was also the
voice of the "iron giant" in 1999's THE IRON GIANT (5/10), and has written
and directed two films of his own, MULTI-FACIAL and STRAYS, which were
screened at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival and 1997 Sundance Film Festival
respectively.
Giovanni Ribisi's birth name is Antonio Giovanni Ribisi. He is a member of
the Church of Scientology.
Ben Affleck's middle name is Geza. He reportedly received only $7,000 to
star in Kevin Smith's CHASING AMY, but went on to pocket $600,000 for his
role in ARMAGEDDON (8/10).
Scott Caan is the son of actor James Caan. He is also a screenwriter in his
own right, having recently sold the rights to his script CHASING THE PARTY:
HOW HUGH HEFNER SAVED MY LIFE to mega-producer Jerry Bruckheimer. The film
is apparently slated for production in early 2000, with Caan attached to
star.
Despite DAZED AND CONFUSED being Nicky Katt's breakthrough role, it is to be
noted that he also played a schoolchild in 1984's GREMLINS.
Writer/director Ben Younger makes his feature film directorial debut with
this film. He is a 27-year old Brooklynite who attended the City University
of New York studying in political science, and put himself through school by
working as a stand-up comic. After becoming the youngest campaign manager in
NY City, he switched from politics to filmmaking, and came up with the idea
for this script when he was recruited as a boiler room trainee himself.
What is a "boiler room"? It's a brokerage firm that houses a bunch of
hard-working, smart-mouthed kids off the streets who pressure their
cold-call customers any which way they can into buying stock in unknown or
bogus companies for huge commissions. Once the price of the stock is driven
high enough, insiders sell, making fortunes for themselves and often wiping
out the savings of innocent investors. They are seductive, secretive firms
where only those trained and recruited to be loyal are allowed inside.
Recently, the North American Securities Administrators Association made
prosecuting boiler rooms a top priority.</P>
