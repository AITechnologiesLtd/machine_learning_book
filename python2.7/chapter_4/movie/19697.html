<PRE>"The Faculty"</PRE>
<PRE>Reviewed by Heather Picker</PRE>
<P>     Directed by Robert Rodriguez.  Written by Kevin Williamson.  Starring
Jordana Brewster, Clea DuVall, Laura Harris, Josh Hartnett, Shawn Hatosy and
Elijah Wood.  1998, 104 min., Rated R.</P>
<P>     Because of the usual critical overreaction that accompanies the release of
many American films that are intended to be no more than an hour and a half
long popcorn-filled break from reality, "The Faculty" was panned by most.  And
I went into this viewing experience not expecting much.  After all, director
Robert Rodriguez went from "El Mariachi" to "Desperado" and Kevin "Scream"
Williamson's scripts become tediously self-referential.  The theatrical trailer
boasted the previous projects of director and screenwriter more than it did the
actual movie.  Even the Tommy Hilfiger ad campaign, which would make one
believe that R&B star Usher was the main attraction of "The Faculty," quickly
wore out their welcome.  How did my opinion change after actually seeing it? 
You may be as surprised as I was.</P>
<P>     Lacking the satirical edge that fueled both "Scream" entries; "The
Faculty" manages to be a parody instead, not entirely with success.  "The
Breakfast Club," "Alien," "The Thing," and "The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"
are all evident influences.  More than influences, they provide the plot and
familiar characters.  Herrington High used to be a typical school in Ohio.  But
lately the teachers have been acting strange, and six seemingly mismatched
teens will have to tolerate one another in order to save the day.  Delilah
(Jordana Brewster) is the head cheerleader and editor of the school paper who
is dating Stan (Shawn Hatosy), the star quarterback who is sick of getting
preferential treatment because of his place on the social hierarchy.  He worked
hard for the D he got on that science test.  How dare Mr. Furlong (Jon Stewart,
host of "The Daily Show") give him a higher grade for having a golden arm that
has led to the team having a great season?  </P>
<P>     Zeke (Josh Hartnett, "Halloween: H20") is the bad boy.  His parents are
gone, possibly to Europe, and as he repeats his senior year he sells homemade
drugs, fake IDs, and video tapes featuring full frontal nudity of Neve Campbell
and Jennifer Love Hewitt (stars respectively of "Scream" and "I Know What You
Did Last Summer," another Williamson script) out of his trunk in the school
parking lot.  Rounding out the group are the new girl, Marybeth of Atlanta
(Laura Harris), geeky, much harassed photographer Casey (Elijah Wood, the
veteran of the young cast), and Stokely (Clea DuVall, in a standout
performance), the sci-fi reading, darkly dressed outcast whose ambiguity leads
Delilah to fire off several homophobic insults.</P>
<P>     The faculty itself, consisting of Nurse Harper (Salma Hayek in her
obligatory appearance in a Rodriguez film) who's saving her sick days for when
she feels better; Miss Burke (Famke Janssen), a bookish teacher who transforms
into a sexpot and who has a very funny scene with Zeke; Mrs. Olson (Piper
Laurie, who was spooky in "Carrie" and "Twin Peaks"); Principal Drake (Bebe
Neuwirth, in a nod to Lillith and her "Cheers" days); Mr. Furlong; and steely
Coach Willis (Robert Patrick, from "T2: Judgement Day") is bent on making the
town pod people.  </P>
<P>     As the six students race to find out who the "Queen" of the pod people is
in order to prevent disaster, they begin doubting each other, and with good
reason.  Fast pacing, dialogue that is at times surprisingly lame, and hokey
special effects add to the jovial atmosphere.  Particularly amusing are the
insults Stokely throws around and Summer Phoenix as a girl who is always
yelling profanities at and hitting her boyfriend.  It's not quite campy; it's a
bit more serious than that.  "The Faculty" is, however, entertaining, a
throwback to the era in cinema history when cheesy sci-fi stories were viewed
at drive-in theaters by teenagers on the weekend.  A grade A B movie,
recommended.  </P>
