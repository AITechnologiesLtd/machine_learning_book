<PRE>REVIEW:  Red Corner (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>by Luke Buckmaster</PRE>
<PRE>2 stars out of 5</PRE>
<P>I was recently told that in China their had been strong protests against the
release of Red Corner  and this is apparently because of the way it shows the
injustice of many Chinese laws.  But if you ask me, the real truth of the matter
is that the Chinese Critics Association were determined not to punish the
population into viewing Richard Gere running across rooftops in search for a
fellow American.  Or more the point, anyone that allows him to bask in his own
less-than-subtle presence.</P>
<P>This is not an insult to Gere, as I consider him to be a rather talented actor 
but more the choice of character and responsibility of his role.</P>
<P>If a film is solely about one person, the main actor must give a faultless
performance in order for it to really work.  Although Geres performance is in
no way poorly acted, it is far from perfect  and I look forward to seeing him
star with other talented actors that can reduce the need for him to carry a film
by himself.  This is where he truly belongs, and if you are reluctant to believe
me than look no further that Primal Fear (with the sensational Edward Norton),
The Jackal (with Bruce Willis) and Pretty Woman (with the delightful Julia
Roberts).</P>
<P>In Red Corner Gere plays classy lawyer Jack Moore, who is guilty of the same
personality traits as his character Martin Vail in Primal Fear  bold and up
front, who thinks he is three steps ahead of everybody else but is actually two
steps behind.  It is with invulnerability of both mental and physical kind that
the character of Moore is portrayed, which left me barracking for the Chinese to
haul his sorry ass into jail.</P>
<P>It doesnt take long from the films beginning for Jack Moores charm to work on
a pretty Chinese lady, and in no time they are in bed together in a hotel room 
drunk and cheerful.  Yet instead of a hangover, poor Jack finds himself covered
in blood and the Chinese chick dead on a couch.  He is arrested and hauled into
a Chinese prison.  His cell, food and rights  all terrible.</P>
<P>Now trapped in a foreign land without adequate aid from the American embassy,
lawyer Shen Yuelin (Bai Ling) defends his case by initially pleading guilty to
the charge of murder.  Jack and Shen argue about their countries different laws;
Shen stating that they will shoot you in the back and charge the cost of the
bullet to your family.</P>
<P>As the plot thickens, scenes get progressively more ridiculous  ranging from
Richard Gere running over rooftops in search of the US embassy to a Scooby Doo
ending where the least expected but-you-knew-along criminal is discovered.
Red Corner is one of those films where you sneer, laugh or vomit youre way
through all of its minutes.  What should have been a politically taunt thriller
is little more than a pointless expedition to see how stressed out Richard Gere
can act.</P>
<P>This is not to say that the film does not have its moments  there are some
tense court room scenes that are shrewdly created  telling the tale of foreign
injustice and government corruption.   But what they amount to spoils the effect
of having them in the first place  perhaps this is why Red Corner is so
frustrating to watch.</P>
<P>If you look at the films overall concept fairly broadly, the basic idea is quite
tangible.  It is upon the films execution where the diminutive plot twists and
developments fail to impress or innovate - the evidence that goes missing, the
high powered officials shielding the truth and intolerable love angles have all
been done so many times before.</P>
<P>If that wasnt bad enough, Red Corners dialogue is purely laughable on many
occasions.  Shen Yuelin attempts to gain sympathy by reciting renaissance of a
destitute relationship with her deceased father, whilst Jack Moore is eager to
talk about Chinese musical instruments when he could have been working on a plan
to free himself.</P>
<P>Taking itself far too seriously, Red Corner is not half the film it intends to
be.  Although it would have benefited from the help of a more valuable
supporting cast, the films main fault is in the bizarre (and often out of
place) way of unfolding a story which isnt that meritorious anyway.</P>
<P>Whilst Richard Gere still proves that has what it takes to be known as a decent
actor, I would think twice before going to see him attempt to manage such a
serious yet hollow drama again.  Martin Vailwhere are you?</P>
