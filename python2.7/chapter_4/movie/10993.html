<PRE>Deconstructing Harry (1997)</PRE>
<P>Seen on 26 December 1997 for $8 with Wendy and Tony G. at the Paramus
Picture Show, of all places. </P>
<P>Well, I should say right off that bat that despite two major objections, I
really enjoyed this movie. I should also add that there is so much going
on that I almost feel like I ought to see it a second time. </P>
<P>*Deconstructing Harry* blurs the lines between the real lives of writer
Harry Block (Woody Allen) and the people in his life, and the characters
in his stories that are based on them. So, the pill-popping, sex-obsessed
Harry Block is also glimpsed in Bob, Ken (Richard Benjamin), Harvey
(Tobey Maguire), Paul (Stanley Tucci), and Mel (Robin Williams). </P>
<P>Harry has a few ex-wives and ex-girlfriends who cannot deal with him and
his obsession with sex. His latest book details how he cheated on his wife
with her sister, and the latter shows up at his house ready to shoot him
for his thinly disguised portrayal of his betrayals. He has also been
invited to his alma mater, and--getting desperate--he winds up inviting
Cookie (Hazelle Goodman) to accompany him, just as she is. Mind you, she
is the prostitute dressed in a two-piece pink leather outfit who the night 
before Harry ordered to tie him up, beat him, and give him a blowjob.
Along the way, he brings an old friend, and his son. Throughout this
diegesis are flashes from his works of fiction, and flashbacks to Harry's
real life, and his imagination. </P>
<P>All of this could be a frightening mish-mash, but Woody Allen has managed
to pull it all together rather well. This format also allows him to bring
out some hilarious and fantastic moments. Robin Williams is the actor who
is literally out of focus (a wonderful cinematic effect) and expects his
family to adjust to the distortion he has become. Joan, the psychiatrist,
has a hilarious scene in which she constantly leaves a patient so she can
yell at Harry in the next room for cheating on her. The visit to Ha Harry's
orthodox Jewish sister and brother-in-law. Two older women who share a
"dark secret" at a 1976 Bar Mitzvah reception with a Star Wars theme. 
There are many funny moments in *Deconstructing Harry* that make it worth
seeing. </P>
<P>The performances are also very memorable, especially the womens'.
Actresses as disparate as Judy Davis and Kirstie Alley and Demi Moore
really stand out. The women suffer the brunt of Harry's behavior, and that
makes them a lot more interesting than the men.</P>
<P>The denouement of *Deconstructing Harry* does not measure up to the movie,
but that's okay, since the journey is more illuminating than the
destination. Also, the use of really hateful, foul language (the "C word"
is used more than once) is really beneath someone as smart as Woody Allen.
While it amplifies the misogyny of Harry, that misogyny is evident without
it. Some people would say it's brave of him to use this sort of language,
but I think it's an offensive easy way out. </P>
<P>My other main objection is the heralding of the wonderful event--that
Woody has finally given a major role to a black actor. Hazelle Goodman is
absolutely hilarious, but she is playing the prostitute, Cookie! That the
"first major role for an black actor" in a Woody Allen movie is that of a
prostitute is insulting and a stereotype. A black actor could just as
easily have played one of Harry's friends in this movie, and been just as
important. Allen is often criticized that there are no black people in his
movies. The defense has been that the social class he depicts don't have
any interaction with blacks (which is hard to believe); so the only one
that gets this new status is a hooker?</P>
<P>Overall, *Deconstructing Harry* is the strongest movie Allen has put out
in years. The familiar themes of relationships, self-discovery,
self-hating Jews, atheism, are all here and are very entertaining. It's
hard not to disconnect Allen's movies from his real life, but either way,
it's an enjoyable, intelligent romp. </P>
<P>Written and directed by Woody Allen cinematography by Carlo Di Palma, and
production design by Santo Loquasto. </P>
