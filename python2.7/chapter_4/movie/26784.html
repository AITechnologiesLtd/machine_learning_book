"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>`You're horny for a dead girl.'  I can't recall a line from a film as
startling as this.  It's even more alarming because the line doesn't
seem as disquieting during Don't Let Me Die on a Sunday, the latest
French romp through such topics as AIDS, necrophilia and other forms of
deviant sex.</P>
<P>Sunday begins by chopping two different scenes together.  One shows
19-year-old Térésa (Élodie Bouchez, The Dreamlife of Angels) being
slipped a mickey while she's at a smoking rave party.  The other shows
two guys double-teaming a girl in what appears to be a hospital, or some
other type of sterile environment.</P>
<P>The two separate stories quickly merge as Térésa hits the floor like a
sack of potatoes, is pronounced dead and taken to the local morgue,
where the two tag-team partners are employed as attendants.  One of the
men is Ben (Jean-Marc Barr), an apparently sexually frustrated chap who
has been on the job for four years and has clearly flipped his lid.  He
waits to get Térésa's body to himself, and then performs unknown carnal
acts upon it (unknown because, thankfully, they don't show it).</P>
<P>Then, in every necrophiliac's worst nightmare (or their ultimate fantasy
… I'm not sure I care to know), Térésa wakes up while Ben is slamming
away at her.  The authorities are stunned, but for some reason, Térésa
won't press charges, so there's nothing they can do.  Ben is suspended,
and followed first by the girl's father, who beats the shit out of Ben,
and they by Térésa herself.  Naturally, she finds herself drawn to the
man that fucked her back from the other side.</P>
<P>Térésa and Ben link up to perform some pretty strange sexual acts,
although never on each other.  Ben introduces her to a small group of
his friends, who are equally as bent sexually.  One is dying of AIDS in
a hospital, and Ben's friends perform a late night kidnapping to take
him to an isolated cabin to spend his remaining days.  And straight from
Girl on the Bridge, there's a scene where Térésa and Ben save a man who
is about to off himself on a viaduct.  They incorporate him into their
sexual games.</P>
<P>Sunday was written and directed by Didier Le Pêcheur, whose film isn't
nearly as good as Lynne Stopkewich's Kissed, which was about a woman
having sex with dead guys.  The film's subtitles are tough to read
against the white lab coats that are prominently displayed throughout
the film.  Bouchez and Barr do a decent job acting, with the latter
looking like a bizarre cross between Jeremy Piven and Croupier's Clive
Owen.  The film may be trying to deliver an important message about the
state of sex in a world full of various deadly, sexually transmitted
diseases, but it comes off as something made just to get a rise out of
viewers.</P>
<P>1:28 – R for nudity, strong sexual content, violence and adult language</P>
