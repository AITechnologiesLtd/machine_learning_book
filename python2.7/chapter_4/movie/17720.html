<P>Almost every weekend now, teen movies are released.  Most of them are mediocre,
such as Ten Things I Hate About You (C+) and Wing Commander (F), but some of
them are very well done, such as Cruel Intentions (A-), Never Been Kissed (A),
and this film.  Once in awhile, just like in this film's case, the film will be
much more than an attempt to bring in money from teenagers.  They will appeal
to not only teens, but adults as well.  That's that way I feel about the film
Go.  This film is from the director Doug Liman, who also directed the hit movie
Swingers, starring Vince Vaughn.  </P>
<P>The film is actually three short films in one.  Each section follows a
different character and what they do on Christmas Eve.  In most cases, drugs
are the main idea.  The first section of the film is entitled "Ronna."  Sarah
Polley stars as Ronna, a rude grocery store worker.  There, she hangs out with
Claire, played by Katie Holmes, Mannie, played by Nathan Bexton, and Simon,
played by Desmond Askew.  All three are really into drugs.  At the grocery
store, two men (Jay Mohr and Scott Wolf) make a drug deal with Ronna.  Ronna
must get the drugs from a dealer, who also deals for Simon.  The dealer is
Todd, played by Scream 2's (A-) Timothy Olyphant.  She is on her way to a
party, where she makes a lot of money selling allergy medicine to pay back drug
debts.  </P>
<P>Ronna's story is a very interesting one.  Ronna is a very confused character. 
Sarah Polley is very good as the character.  The best character in this story
is Claire.  Katie Holmes is absolutely wonderful as Claire.  Holmes will have a
huge career ahead of her after this film.  Mannie and Simon are not the main
focuses in this story, but they will be seen later on.  Timothy Olyphant is
also superb as Todd.  All of the characters seem very realistic and strange in
this part of the film.</P>
<P>The second section is called "Simon."  We know Simon from earlier, in the story
of "Ronna."  Once again, Desmond Askew plays Simon.  Simon's main hobby is
drugs. Right now, he is in Las Vegas with Marcus, played by How Stella Got Her
Groove Back's Taye Diggs, Singh, played by James Duval, and Tiny, played by
Breckin Meyer.  The three get into big trouble in Vegas, and now they are being
chased by two men who are willing to kill them on the spot.</P>
<P>This part of the film was probably the most unlikable.  Simon is not a very
likable character, but what do expect from a drug crazed maniac?   Askew is
fine as the role, it's just the character.  Taye Diggs was good when he was on
screen, but he didn't get half the screen time he needed to develop his
character.  Meyer and Duval are not seen enough to decide whether they turned
in good performances or not.  </P>
<P>The third and final section is called "Adam and Zack."  These two characters
were seen earlier in the film, during one of the first sequences in the grocery
store.  Adam is played by played by Party of Five's Scott Wolf, and Zack is
played by Playing By Heart's Jay Mohr.  The two are soap opera actors.  This
third section of the film was good.  Mohr turns in a type of performance that I
thought he could never pull off- A non-annoying and even good performance. 
Scott Wolf is also good.</P>
<P>The way Go was done was very impressive.  I really enjoyed the technique, and
especially the way everything tied together in the end.  Maybe the makers of
the film 200 Cigarettes (D) should have used this form if film making, rather
than making the film very confusing.</P>
<P>Another thing that I really loved about Go was the amount of sub-plots it had. 
There was no definitive plot, which gives you a variety of different plots that
are all developed very nicely.  The performances turned out by everyone are
good.  Katie Holmes and Timothy Olyphant are the two performances that are
still in my mind though.  They were both very exceptional and a lot more than I
expected.</P>
<P>Go is a very funny film.  It isn't pure comedy though.  There are a lot of
themes, mainly drugs, that are darker and disturbing.  The drug usage plays a
main part in the film, so I don't think younger teens should see this flick. 
Many sequences are hysterical.  Mannie turns out many laughs after taking too
many drugs.  The sound also adds a lot to the content of the film.  The
soundtrack is fun and fast.  A young teen cast, a fresh soundtrack, and the
funny scenes should make this film a cult hit.  It was much like Trainspotting,
(C+) only a lot more light and fun to watch.  Expect wonderful word of mouth
for this great little film.</P>
<PRE>The Bottom Line- Do not pass Go!  Go to Go as soon as you can go because it is
a great movie to go to! </PRE>
