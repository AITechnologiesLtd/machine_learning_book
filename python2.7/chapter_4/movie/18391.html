<P>STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)
20th Century Fox / 2:11 / 1999 / PG (muted sci-fi violence)
Cast: Liam Neeson; Ewan McGregor; Jake Lloyd; Natalie Portman; Ahmed 
Best; Pernilla August; Ian McDiarmid; Ray Park; Samuel L. Jackson; 
Oliver Ford Davies; Terence Stamp; Frank Oz; Kenny Baker; Anthony 
Daniels 
Director: George Lucas 
Screenplay: George Lucas<HR>In a word: Wow. </P>
<P>That exclamation will likely be the general reaction of those massive 
throngs slowly shuffling from "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom
Menace," regardless of whether or not they actually like the movie. This 
long-awaited premiere prequel in George Lucas' indomitable space saga 
has sumptuous sights up the wazoo: beautiful costumes, dazzling 
architecture, imaginative creature design and lush panoramas of worlds 
familiar and unfamiliar. But ogle-worthy opulence is the lone thing that 
audiences will undoubtedly herald post-"Phantom," as the early buzz from 
both critics and preview screenings has been quite mixed. </P>
<P>Well, fear not, "Wars" watchers - all the iffiness merely comes as a 
side-effect of "Episode I"'s own gargantuan hype. Label any movie "the 
most anticipated event in cinema history" and the build-up is bound to 
let down some, especially those who've been waiting patiently for 
another fix of the Force ever since 1983's "Return of the Jedi." And 
since just about everybody fits into that category, a necessary bit of 
advice would be to approach "The Phantom Menace" aware of these 
king-sized expectations. Do so and you might be tickled pink to discover 
that, while not the pinnacle entry in Lucas' unfolding universe, it 
packs in wall-to-wall intrigue, spectacle and the finest special effects 
money - $115 million, reportedly - can buy.</P>
<P>The story still takes place in a galaxy far, far away, but even more of 
a long time ago - as in several scores before Lucas' other trilogy. The 
nifty opening introduces a younger, brasher version of Obi-Wan Kenobi 
("Trainspotting"'s Ewan McGregor), newly a Jedi Knight and apprentice to 
noble, level-headed Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson). The pair arrive 
on a Trade Federation spaceship to hopefully negotiate the end of a 
blockade that's been royally screwing over the nearby utopian planet of 
Naboo. "I have a bad feeling about this," grouses Obi-Wan, his line sure 
to draw chuckles from those keen on their "Star" lore. Turns out his 
reservations are justified.</P>
<P>Before you can mutter "Dagobah," lightsabers are drawn and enemy robots 
are exchanging fire with our Jedi heroes. They, wise to what's going on, 
hightail it to Naboo to rescue its pacifist teen queen (Natalie Portman) 
from certain death, but their escape envoy gets downed and they find 
themselves in a layover on the desert world of Tatooine. There, Qui-Gon 
meets and is quite taken by young slave boy Anakin Skywalker (Jake 
Lloyd) and his mother Shmi (Pernilla August, injecting emotion amid the 
grandeur), and fates are thusly sealed. This little innocent, we know 
from 1980's "The Empire Strikes Back," grows into the evil asthmatic 
known as Darth Vader.</P>
<P>To tip many more of the plot specifics would be oh so wrong, because 
"The Phantom Menace" provides a sense of wonder and astonishment almost 
as never-ceasing as the 1977 epic that started it all. A few old 
favorites are given tidy origin vignettes, while fascinating new beings 
- enough to fill the original's Cantina five times over - are welcomely 
trotted in front of the camera in their mostly computer-generated glory. 
All this and Lucas can still script and stage a riveting action 
sequence, as evidenced by the exhilarating pod race in which Anakin wins 
his freedom. For those who still thrill to "Ben-Hur"'s chariot chase, 
meet its overdue '90s sci-fi equivalent.</P>
<P>"Episode I" strays into childish territory at times (think Ewoks), 
particularly in its dealings with Jar Jar Binks, a beaked, donkey-eared 
amphibious alien whose clumsy antics and occasionally unintelligible 
island dialect might make you laugh or dig your fingernails into your 
armrest. A completely digital creation choreographed and voiced by 
Broadway performer Ahmed Best, he's this movie's comic relief - but not 
as accessible or successful as, say, bickering droids C-3PO and R2-D2 
(seen here) or growling Wookie Chewbacca (not). The wee ones, however, 
should cackle with delight every time Jar Jar flails, fumbles or fumes.</P>
<P>But that's not to suggest that this is strictly a kiddie flick. There's 
menace in "Menace," and a great deal of it emanates from enigmatic
villain Darth Maul. Maul, a cooler baddie than Boba Fett, is also the 
Character Most Likely to Inspire After-Viewing Discussion; as brought to 
life by famed martial artist Ray Park, he's a mass of oozing evil 
accentuated by demonic red-and-black Kabuki make-up and a dark hood that 
hides threatening horns. Many will ponder why he's given such little 
screen time, where they can learn his quick-as-lightening moves and how 
to become a member of his fan club. Maul's climactic lightsaber 
three-way with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan is truly a brawl to behold.</P>
<P>Neeson and McGregor play off each other nicely, with the former lending 
all the showy showmanship gravity and the latter doing a grin-inducing 
Alec Guinness impersonation. Portman, looking lovely and Geisha-like 
under a series of bold gowns and bolder headdresses, makes a regal if 
delicate ruler - and a fine role model if any little girls wander into 
this ultimate boy fantasy. Lloyd, neither as splendid nor stinky as his 
respective supporters and detractors claim, is the sole acting weak 
link, but whether his relative inexperience or the occasionally 
tin-eared dialogue he's required to enliven are to blame is in the air 
(though he's typically strong when it counts).</P>
<P>Rest assured, the flaws here are minor distractions rather than gaping 
mistakes. The questionable gossip seems to stem from the unavoidable 
disappointment following a nearly decade-and-a-half wait and the 
rumblings that "The Phantom Menace" has a ton of setting-up to do. No 
matter. Once the going gets good, Lucas puts "Episode I" on hyperdrive, 
complete with four simultaneous big-risk battles, a passionate plea in a 
stunningly-realized senate chamber and a concluding montage that readies 
for "Episode II" with lip-smacking, spine-tingling foreshadowing.</P>
<P>It's only what ... another three years?<HR>© 1999 Jamie Peck

"Disaster movies always have little vignettes of everyday life. The 
dumbest in ‘Armageddon' involves two Japanese tourists in a New York 
taxi. After meteors turn an entire street into a flaming wasteland, the 
woman complains, ‘I want to go shopping!' I hope in Japan that line is 
redubbed as ‘Nothing can save us but Gamera!'" -Roger Ebert on 
"Armageddon"</P>
