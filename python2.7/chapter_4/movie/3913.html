<PRE>                              BATMAN FOREVER
                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1995 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>     If circumstances force you to see BATMAN FOREVER, buy some malted
milk balls, slip into your seat, and prepare to plan your taxes or your
summer vacation.  This is a movie that will leave you there, uninvolved,
while it screams forth an explosion of noise and image that has nothing
much to do with anything.</P>
<P>     It would be charitable to dwell on the special effects, like the
surreal rendering of Gotham as a city of glossy stainless steel
cylinders and shafts.  It could also be said that the grotesque makeup
on Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and the Riddler (Jim Carrey) is a
technical achievement and that the cast makes merry with its parts.
But any of that would be an excessive stretch.</P>
<P>     The truth is that this movie is interminably dull and inexcusably
bad.  Just as television news gives viewers mere snippets of events
shown behind the blow-dried hair and taut faces of its anchors, so
"Batman" assaults the audience with empty images.  The invitation,
implicit in the purchase of a movie ticket, to step out of your world
and into someone else's has escaped producer Tim Burton and his staff
completely.  Theirs is a lifeless party.</P>
<P>     See that ball rolling?  See the plunging cylinder?  Where are they
going?  Where did they come from?  You will never know, because the
movie is filmed in such extreme closeup that you can't tell what is
happening.  It's enough, the filmmakers think, to give us a jazzy
montage of fireballs, helicopters, and geometric shapes.  They didn't
waste a minute on building the suspense essential to an action film.</P>
<P>     A two-hour dose of computerized images is intolerably insulting to
an audience waiting to be invited into the fun.  Even if the
determination of the Riddler and Two-Face to unmask Batman is enough of
a premise, we want to be captured.  Scare us, surprise us, make us
laugh!  We want to be horrified at the plunging elevator, intimidated
by a height, frightened by the sea.  Instead we sit, bored and annoyed,
until we, the offended audience, finally shuffle out into the lobby,
angry at a lost night.</P>
<P>     Of the actors, only Michael Gough as Alfred brings a bit of polish
to the mess.  Val Kilmer is adequate as Batman, with metal nipples, but
the poor guy is given not one line or situation that he might infuse
with panache.  A comic strip without a sophisticated light touch is a
dead fish.</P>
<P>     Tommy Lee Jones is game as the psychotic Two-Face, but his part,
without lines or style, is merely a wheel-spinner.  Chris O'Donnell
brings a little dash to Robin, the all-American sidekick, and Jim
Carrey continues to build a career on looking ridiculous in variations
of hair styles and hats.</P>
<P>     Nicole Kidman looks her best, if that helps.  And she delivers the
movie's best line:  "I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who
dresses like a rodent."   Precisely.  But no one did.</P>
