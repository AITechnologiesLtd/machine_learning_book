<P>The curtain goes up.  A single woman jogs on the beach.  She finds an
incredibly romantic letter that changes her life and then ships her kid
off so that she can concentrate on the note.  No, it's not the eagerly
awaited re-release of Kevin Costner's Message in a Bottle – it's The
Love Letter, Dreamworks' counter-programming for the Star Wars
phenomenon.</P>
<P>The woman is Helen MacFarquhar (Kate Capshaw, Indiana Jones & the Temple
of Doom), the owner of a small used bookstore in a quaint Massachusetts
burg - you know, the kind of shop that can afford to have several
employees, but not one customer.  She doesn't know who wrote the letter,
but eventually decides that it must be Johnny (Tom Everett Scott, Dead
Man on Campus), a college student working at the shop during the
summer.  Dopey Helen just leaves the life-changing letter out, and it is
discovered by Johnny, who thinks that Helen wrote it for him, and also
by co-worker Janet (Ellen DeGeneres, Goodbye Lover), who thinks that
George (Tom Selleck, In & Out), the hunky town fireman, wrote it for
her.</P>
<P>More disturbing than the asinine story is the fact that Capshaw, for the
second movie in a row, gets to bump uglies with a boy half her age (it
was David Arquette in The Alarmist).  Plus, she also served as a
producer for The Love Letter, so that means that real-life hubby Steven
Spielberg had to shell out his own dough to watch his wife run around
with younger, better-looking guys.  Anybody have Amy Irving's phone
number?  (1:28 – R for adult language and an out-of-focus ass-shot of
Capshaw)</P>
