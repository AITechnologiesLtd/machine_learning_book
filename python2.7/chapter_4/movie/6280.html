      Starring Christopher Walken, Chris Penn, Vincent Gallo,

<P>"Carry this with you," Ray Tempio's father tells him, handing
him the empty casing of a bullet that the boy has just used
to kill a man. "Nothing will cost you more." At his father's
urging, young Ray executed an enemy of his family. If you
show mercy to your enemies, he's told, they will come back to
kill you.</P>
<P>Ray has carried those words with him through his formative
and adult years, even though they may be a reflection of the
kind of philosophy that led his father to suicide. Still,
it's the philosophy he knows -- part of the worldview he's
locked into. The scene comes in a flashback early in Abel
Ferrara's Depression-era gangster movie, The Funeral. Fans of
Ferrara's earlier work -- which includes King of New York,
Bad Lieutenant and last year's wacked-out vampire allegory,
The Addiction -- should know what to expect, but many others
may be baffled by this oddball crime drama cum murder mystery
cum philosophical treatise. Ferrara's heady moral brew is an
aquired taste: bitter, yet rare and satisfying.</P>
<P>Christopher Walken, Chris Penn, and Vincent Gallo are Ray,
Chez, and Johnny Tempio. The latter brother is laid out dead
in a coffin as the movie begins, three bullet holes in his
chest. Ray, who presides over the funereal household with an
eerie majesty, is bent on vengeance. Chez, a loose cannon, is
just angry. Watch carefully -- Ferrara switches into
flashback without warning, so viewers are advised to keep on
their toes.</P>
<P>We learn more about Johnny -- he was a budding Communist
whose ideals gave him keen interest in his racketeering
family's influence on labor unions. He was a brash loudmouth
who fed his hubris by dating the wife of rival Gaspare
Spoglia (Benicio del Toro). But most of all, he was a Tempio,
and that means Ray is out for blood. Ray's henchmen round up
and question Gaspare, the most likely culprit. But as Ray
investigates deeper, he's confronted with the possibility
that Johnny may have gotten just what was coming to him. And
what then?</P>
<P>The women have had their fill of violence and vengeance.
Ray's wife Jeanette (Anabella Sciorra) confides to Johnny's
fiance (Gretchen Mol) that she's lucky she won't wind up
married to "one of them," and keeps a figure of Saint Agnes
next to the bed, as a reminder of "what happens to you when
you say no." Lancome spokesmodel Isabella Rossellini looks
startlingly world weary as Chez's beleagured wife, and she
has her own saint on the table -- the patroness of treatment
for the insane.</P>
<P>Indeed, it's the very real tribulations of these women that
help keep the testosterone-enhanced performances of Walken
and Penn in check. The Funeral never takes the easy tack of
glamorizing its gangsters, and Sciorra's strong-minded
performance is a tough and unsentimental reminder of how
lives are torn apart by sacred bonds turned unholy.</P>
<P>Ferrara gives her plenty of screen space, since she's got a
pair of scenery-chewing performances to compete with. Walken
is, as ever, giddily hammish. He's intense and scary and very
serious about the role, but there's an element of high comedy
buried underneath the facade. Walken is such a good actor
than even though he's unmistakably aware of how crazy his
character is, he plays it with an unwavering passion even as
he tumbles over the top.</P>
<P>Still, the real kudos must go to Penn, who's stuck exercising
mostly his aptitude for ugliness. I've had my fill of the
abusive male as a character type, but Penn really helps us
understand this one. Ferrara never asks us to excuse Chez's
behavior toward women -- Chez treats his wife poorly and with
little passion; he first rebukes, then forces himself on a
young prostitute who can't comprehend his sudden moralizing
-- but he does remember to show us why this man has a wife
and friends in the first place. In one of the movie's best
and truest scenes, Chez belts out a pop tune, surrounded by
friends and associates at his bar. The exuberant magnetism
Penn summons is undeniable, and a great testament to his
still-underrated talents.</P>
<P>The Funeral isn't all so well-balanced. Ever since Bad
Lieutenant, I've wished Ferrara and longtime collaborator
Nicholas St. John could find a way to better weave their more
didactic concerns into the fabric of the film. As it is, the
film stops dead several times so that the characters can have
conversations that delve into moral responsibility and the
teachings of Catholicism. These are almost Godardian moments,
where the audience is suddenly jerked out of the movie's
fiction-world to be lectured. I also have severe reservations
about the very ending of the picture, which is a big, gaudy
exclamation point at the end of an otherwise well-constructed
story. It may be the logical extension of Chez's tortured
existence, but it's an extension that we could well have
imagined without seeing it actually played out on-screen.</P>
<P>Ferrara got his start making deliciously nasty exploitation
flicks that left nothing much to the imagination (Driller
Killer, Ms. 45). He's now working in a different milieu, and
it's one that he hasn't necessarily come to terms with.
Still, the low-key style he has pioneered over his body of
work, unpleasant and unrelenting, seems to me a more
significant and consistent exploration of modern America's
dark side than anything that's been tried recently. His
accomplishments dwarf the much flashier series of film noir
retreads we've been subjected to, films which simply
fetishize their subject matter rather than exploring it.
Whatever else Ferrara may be, he's an explorer, and The
Funeral may be as good a point as any for a willing neophyte
to join the expedition.</P>
