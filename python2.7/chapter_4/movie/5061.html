<PRE>                                   LILITH
                       A film review by Ralph Benner
                        Copyright 1996 Ralph Benner</PRE>
<P>     After reading "Warren Beatty and Desert Eyes," you wonder if
author-critic David Thomson can sleep well at night knowing that his
hyperbole on Robert Rossen's LILITH is so far off the mark as to become
self-tormenting: it's "the best film Beatty has made at that point in
his career and you could make a case that it is the best he will ever
make. A failure in its year (1964), the picture grows more profound and
beautiful as the years pass by. It is a lake that resists every effort
to plumb its depths....(it's) the picture that most clearly engages
Beatty in something like his own appetite for sexual encounters."
Anyone who has paid even the slightest attention to Beatty's
near-legendary sexcapades knows that Hal Ashby's SHAMPOO comes closest
to what we perceive as the image of Beatty's hungers (not excluding
self-respect). And how is it possible not to fathom Lilith when its
depth is considerably lower than one's own crotch? But Thomson's
British-born and educated, which goes a long way in explaining his
witless annotation. His across-the-Atlantic view also explains why he
doesn't "see" a more reasonable explanation for Rossen's movie having
failed at the box office and as an artfully lyrical examination of
sexual addiction: American audiences were deep into Hollywoodized
mental analysis about themselves in movies like SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS,
THE HUSTLER, A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE, THE CHILDREN'S HOUR, THE
MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, DAVID & LISA, and via TV shows like "Alfred
Hitchcock Presents," "Ben Casey," "Kraft Suspense Theater" and the
psycho-doc-is-in-session stuff like "The 11th Hour," "Breaking Point,"
and, if none of that enough, the English booked appointments for us in
ROOM AT THE TOP, LOOK BACK IN ANGER, A TASTE OF HONEY, THE ENTERTAINER,
SONS AND LOVERS, SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY MORNING, THE MARK, VICTIM,
THIS SPORTING LIFE and, unsure if it's an English or American
production, LOLITA. So when LILITH came onto the scene, and concluded
with a "Twilight Zone" last line from Beatty, intimating that he too is
trapped by the irresistible lure of sex, smart but babble-fatigued
movie goers weren't too impressed. After SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS, THE
ROMAN SPRING OF MRS. STONEand ALL FALL DOWN, they had already granted
that Beatty was well on his way to proving that he indeed saw Hollywood
as a great big bed.</P>
<P>     Rossen's LILITH is a respectable bomb, though: it wants to dive in
to the murky waters of sex, into an exploration of what turns people
on, that just because one person's appetites are different from the
norm, they shouldn't be conclusively judged as abnormal. As the
scheming Lilith, Jean Seberg is institutionalized because she's a
nymphomaniac, and, as a therapist-in-training trying to pull her from
her amoralism, Beatty falls in love with her. But the premise is
misleading. He isn't really in love with her, he's intrigued by her,
and, it becomes obvious, is turned on by her teasing sexuality. (The
only honest scene in the movie is when, after discovering that Lilith
has made it with another woman, he has to have her right then and
there.) But you don't believe that this screen Lilith is so powerful a
sexual magnet that she can draw in so many; something's missing - an
angelic demoness vacillating between sexual bliss and fatal
attraction.  Seberg was never much of an actress to begin with, and
it's unfortunate that she was chosen over other actresses considered:
Sarah Miles, Diane Cilento, Samantha Eggar or Yvette Mimieux, who might
have been the most rewarding. Not only needing the break, Mimieux had
the beauty to pull off a sort of supernal looniness needed to entice,
to entrap, to be the icon of free sex. Seberg, on the other hand, isn't
much more than a tramp with extra-large looking front teeth that have a
repellency when viewed close up. Seberg's real-life suicide may add a
mystifying lore to LILITH, but it has zero effect in enhancing her
performance. And that once more Beatty is a movie's most beautiful love
object is disconcerting, and made even more so by his ludicrously
moody, intentionally evasive portrayal.</P>
<P>     Watching LILITH, based on the 1961 J.R. Salamanca novel, you will
quickly surmise that it would have benefited from having been made,
say, in the 70s, when the subject of sex didn't face the threats of
censorship and the National Catholic Office. But you can appreciate
Rossen's attempt in trying not to make judgment on the self-discovery
of the ease with which one can become a sexual habitue. Rossen's last
movie, and it's also lenser Eugen Schufftan's last American picture -
another example of what we miss by not using b & w. The more observant
amongst viewers will note the house that Gene Hackman and Jessica
Walter live in - designed by Richard Sylbert - will two years later in
WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? become the playground in which Liz and
Dick play their "hump the hostess" and "get the guests" games.</P>
