<P>There's something about Drew Barrymore that brings out the big brother in 
me. I'm not sure whether it's her genuinely sweet nature, the way she 
emerged triumphant from a rocky adolescence, or just some residual "E.T." 
magic, but the notion of criticizing such a charming young performer 
makes me uncomfortable. It should be obvious by this point that I'm going 
to do so anyway, but hopefully the preceding remarks will at least 
establish that I'm not happy about it.</P>
<P>"Never Been Kissed" is a lousy movie. The premise, while far from 
original, is serviceable enough. A fledgling reporter masquerades as a 
high school student to do a story on the youth of today. Several years 
earlier she suffered great pain as an outcast in school, and the 
assignment affords her the golden opportunity for a second chance. This 
time she'll get it right.</P>
<P>She doesn't, of course, and neither does the movie. The filmmakers behind 
"Never Been Kissed" apparently believe that as long as they provide a 
fuzzy-wuzzy romantic finale, it makes no difference how they get there. 
The movie makes virtually every mistake in the book, including flagrantly 
violating the moral of their own story. </P>
<P>"Find out who you are and try not to be afraid of it," our 25 year old 
heroine nobly proclaims late in the film. This inspirational statement 
comes from a person who pretends to be someone she isn't and tries to 
insinuate herself with the vacuous school elite through patently phony 
affectations. She fails, only to be rescued when her 23 year old brother 
joins the charade and also re-enrolls, becoming an instant hit by downing 
a tub of cole slaw in the cafeteria, then bestowing his sister with 
popularity by telling the in-crowd how cool she is. Right.</P>
<P>Drew Barrymore was delightful in "The Wedding Singer," "Ever After" and 
even "Home Fries," but turns in a terribly strained performance here. As 
anal-retentive copy editor turned hapless reporter Josie Geller, she 
whines, winces and crinkles her eyes continuously, desperately trying to 
wring some pathos out of her poorly written character. In one of the 
worst cases of miscasting in years, she plays a high school loser who 
grew into a mousy adult. Buried under bad make-up, she is quite 
embarrassing but never convincing.</P>
<P>As a reporter, her character is even worse. We're expected to believe 
that a professional, whose job is to check facts, would fail to research 
teen fashion, instead showing up at school dressed like a go-go dancer 
from the '60s. We're expected to believe that a reporter would sit down 
with students she has just met and ask "What are you guys' hopes and 
dreams?" Nothing Josie Geller says or does is even remotely credible, 
especially her idiotic romantic gesture at the film's climax; an exercise 
in public humiliation that no human on Earth would subject themselves to 
in a million years, except in the wonderful world of contrived movies.</P>
<P>The awfulness doesn't stop with Barrymore. John C. Reilly, Mark 
Wahlberg's pornstar-pal in "Boogie Nights," is flat-out dreadful as 
Josie's boss, doing a wretched imitation of Lou Grant. Garry Marshall 
chews scenery as a management tyrant, and young Leelee Sobieski (the 
talented actor from "Deep Impact" who looks like Helen Hunt Jr.) has far 
too much innate poise and dignity to pull off her role as a contemporary 
high school geek.</P>
<P>About 40 minutes into the film, screenwriters Abby Kohn and Marc 
Silverstein make matters even more annoying by slapping a hidden micro-
camera onto Josie, subjecting us to pointless "Truman Show" style 
reaction shots of Chicago Sun-Times staff members (get this) sitting 
around the office for hours and hours watching the monitor, enraptured by 
Josie's pratfalls and her quasi-romantic relationship with a teacher 
(Michael Vartan, an anemic-looking fellow inexplicably presented as a 
dreamboat). I can hardly wait to read what Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger 
Ebert has to say about how the film depicts the inner-workings of his 
newspaper.</P>
<P>There are a few bright spots in the production. Molly Shannon makes the 
most of her supporting role, particularly in an amusing scene where she 
pretends to be a sex-education teacher, and the always goofy David 
Arquette, despite looking too old to play Barrymore's younger brother, 
projects an odd giddiness that is fun to watch. In fact, his character, a 
lost young man who views the high-school re-enrollment facade as a last 
chance to realize his dream of becoming a ballplayer, is far more 
interesting and engaging than Josie.   </P>
<P>Subjecting an innocuous trifle like "Never Been Kissed" to so much 
bashing may seem excessive, but when hack filmmakers steal 107 minutes of 
my life, they deserve what they get. As for Drew Barrymore, hopefully 
she'll take a good look at this bad flick and be more selective when 
accepting future roles. She deserves better than this and so do we.</P>
