<P>An authority figure speaks the defining line of dialogue in _Bully_, Larry 
Clark's quasi-sequel to his own hotly contested _Kids_ "I don't know what 
you're up to. I don't think I want to know." Often accused, even with only 
three motion pictures under his belt, of over-sensationalizing already 
sensationalistic material, Clark is hardly the next Oliver Stone; he is 
something of an interfering observer, but not a conspiracy proselytizer 
running with scissors down the hallway. Where Stone drew slave parallels to 
football in _Any Given Sunday_ by intercutting clips from _Ben-Hur_, Clark 
makes more organic shock statements. He can be tactless, sure. Can't we all?</P>
<P>The scene from _Bully_ that's causing a ruckus features the flip single 
mother played by Bijou Phillips on the phone in a salon while getting a 
pedicure. As her conversation winds down, we get a leering close-up of her 
crotch. As the vantage point of the pedicurist, it's not an entirely 
illogical insert, and with Phillips sitting there spread-eagle, the shot 
has overtones of the hetero male audience's telepathic projection. If Larry 
Clark were younger (he's 58), cleaner (he spent a lot of the 
post-production time on his _Another Day in Paradise_ in rehab), and not a 
professional voyeur of teenagers (numerous acclaimed photo essays about the 
youth scene got him a movie career), _Bully_ would've turned out different, 
but do his age and experiences mean he's a dirty old man or on to us and 
exposing our hypocritical indignation? If hatchling _American Pie_ 
directors the Weitz brothers were Clark's age, they probably still would've 
emerged unscathed from showing Shannon Elizabeth nude for the duration of a 
genre-cushioned sequence that is, I dare say, less forgivable than _Bully_ 
at its most button-pushing. Think about it a guy asks a girl (Elizabeth) 
whose English isn't so good over to his house and, knowing that she'll need 
to change clothing once there, surreptitiously videotapes her getting 
undressed and enables his friends to watch via the Internet--and we're cued 
to laugh.</P>
<P>What continues to appal me about _Bully_ is but a by-product of the film 
its raw depiction of sex has overshadowed an incendiary act of violence 
around which everything else orbits. That I am forced to address a glimpse 
of pubic hair ahead of manslaughter officially confirms the reversal of 
western society's hedonistic poles, and casts a doubtful shadow over my own 
sexually curious teen years. I encountered no more over-the-top knee-jerk 
reaction than these odious reader comments that Dave Poland published last 
Wednesday</P>
<P>"'_Bully_' is perverted for no reason I could figure out except to satisfy 
Mr. Clark's old man obsession with young people's bodies. He seems to leer 
on the actors for no reason at all and even the younger, often shirtless, 
boys like Marty's brother came across as victims of some kind of unseemly 
voyeurism and I felt dirty for being a part of it. I'm about as far away 
from being a prude as you can [sic] but this movie just felt wrong."</P>
<P>_Bully_ takes place in Florida, in the middle of summer. To this 
self-declared non-prude (David nicknamed him "Not Fester") I ask, what 
would a boy who is anything but shirtless be doing in Florida on a hot 
summer's day? Because DVD commentary on _Another Day in Paradise_ indicates 
that Steven Spielberg is the bane of Clark's existence, I wonder how 
squirmy the idiotic Not Fester got when a gaggle of half-naked 
pre-adolescents ogled Haley Joel Osment in Spielberg's recent A.I. 
Artificial Intelligence. Not Fester's common alloy of anatomical shame and 
political paranoia will soon castrate artistic expression altogether.</P>
<P>Based on a true story, though muted, in some way, by homogenizing the races 
of the actual participants, _Bully_ stars the alluring Seth Green-David 
Spade fusion Nick Stahl in the title role as the abusive, college-bound 
best friend of spacey surfer Marty (the frequently touching Brad Renfro, a 
co-producer). Marty's girlfriend, Lisa (ex-Macaulay Culkin Rachel Miner), 
grows tired of the perennially looming black cloud that is Stahl's Bobby 
and rallies the troops to kill him; she's also pregnant with either Marty 
or Bobby's child (the latter would be by rape), and seems to believe that 
Bobby's death would rule him out as the biological father. The 
protagonists' relentless, veracious witlessness is hopefully more 
unsettling than the film's explicit nature; in the case of the stoners, we 
sense a façade, and wonder if they ever inhale. (Michael Pitt's performance 
is one rife with subtext in that regard, but also so off-putting as to 
discourage repeat viewings.) Like Clark's _Kids_, the crackling 
conversation piece _Bully_ will serve parents better than it does their 
offspring because one can't see the forest through the trees. Have I 
mentioned that Bobby, however repellent, is the film's most sympathetic 
character? Go with an open mind.</P>
