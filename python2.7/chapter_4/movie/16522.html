<P>After law student Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) loses all of his money in 
a poker game to a violent Russian loanshark Teddy KGB (John Malkovich), 
he promises his girlfriend Jo (Gretchen Mol) that he has given up 
gambling for good. This pledge is put to the test nine months later when 
a childhood friend (and fellow cardsharp) Lester "Worm" Murphy (Edward 
Norton) is released from prison. Lester is heavily indebted to 
loansharks and is anxious to win enough money to pay them back. However, 
while Mike relies on his skill to read body language and keep track of 
which cards have already been played, Lester prefers to cheat.</P>
<P>John Dahl's examination of card players seems like two movies grafted 
clumsily together. The first is a low-budget tale of people on the 
margins - desperately hoping for the big score which they think will 
transform their lives without realising that their obsession can only 
consume them rather than save them. The other movie is a star vehicle 
for rising stars Damon and Norton, with heavy-duty cameos from 
Malkovich, John Turturro and Martin Landau. Unfortunately, the synergy
does not add to the entertainment.</P>
<P>Dahl evokes the seedy surroundings of seedy back-street gambling dens 
most effectively and populates this environment with realistic 
characters. Turturro plays a professional poker player, Joey Knish, who 
'has never worked a day in his life' since he earns a solid if 
unremarkable income from his card games. McDermott (who is close to him) 
is vaguely contemptuous of Knish because he never risks everything just 
to bluff an opponent (which is how McDermott lost all his money to begin 
with). There's nothing glamorous about Knish and the other players - 
since the all know the tricks of the trade, they don't win much money 
off each other. Occasionally, they all head out to Atlantic City and 
separate some unsuspecting tourists from their cash.</P>
<P>Since gambling involves losing money, loansharks feature heavily on the 
scene, and the collection of a particular debt provides the dynamic 
which drives the film. On his release, Worm tempts Mike back into an 
all-night game with some wealthy students. Since the students don't know 
that the two are working together, Worm pretends to lose everything 
while Mike makes a killing. However, Mike doesn't realise the extent of 
Worm's debt and that Worm has been using Mike's name to gain credit and 
to run up more debt.</P>
<P>As Worm's luck turns bad, and his debt increases, he find out that his 
debt belongs to Teddy KGB, who will resort to very extreme methods to 
retrieve his money. His only hope is to raise enough money by going on a 
non-stop gambling spree in a week. Since Mike is a better player, Worm 
needs to his help or his doomed. This poses a dilemma for Mike, since he 
knows that he will lose his girlfriend and probably his law-degree if he 
agrees to help Worm.</P>
<P>John Dahl's previous movies (such as Red Rock West and The Last 
Seduction) have centred around deception and are usually inhabited by 
people with a very healthy distrust of each other. One would think that 
a film about poker-players, given that deception is an integral part of 
the game, that enable Dahl bring the same darkly gleeful interplay 
between the main protagonists. This doesn't happen, simply because the 
plot is too pedestrian to provide any diversions from the well-trodden 
path of predictability.</P>
<P>There are certain conventions which are always followed in film-making. 
For example, in a western, we all know that at the end of the movie, the 
hero (unless it's a horse) will strap on a gun, walk down a dusty street 
and shoot it out with the bad guy. Similarly, in a movie that features 
games such as pool or cards, there will have to be a climactic 
winner-takes-all match at the end, between the underdog, no-hope hero 
and the reigning champion whom nobody has ever beaten. Dahl doesn't 
stray from this convention and his intentions are clearly signalled from 
the outset of the movie. It is a bit surprising, considering the offbeat 
and original treatment he afforded to the genre of the heist movie in 
his previous work.</P>
<P>The weakest element, by a mile, is Matt Damon. He is not the least bit 
convincing as some-one so obsessed with gambling that he will sacrifice 
his career and relationship for gambling. His fresh-faced, clean-cut 
looks contrast sharply with the worn, faded appearance of the other 
card-playing characters, and it simply not credible that he could 
inhabit, with ease, the same world as Teddy KGB and Turturro (excellent 
as the world-weary Knish). His miscasting is highlighted by the 
narration (delivered by Damon) which is wise beyond his years - the 
voice simply doesn't fit the story it is telling. Damon seems to have 
taken the concept of a "poker face" too seriously, since he reserves the 
same half-smirk to express every emotion. I'm an admirer of Damon as an 
actor, but I did not think that this was a good performance. </P>
<P>Edward Norton fares better as Worm, though his role is less substantial. 
His character is simply present to act as a foil for Mike and to test 
his resolve, and is subsequently less well developed. Though the 
supposed bond between Mike and Worm is crucial to the film, it is 
entirely unconvincing, and as Worm gets himself into more trouble, there 
is no clear reason why Mike should stick with him. The conflict between 
Mike's gambling and his duties as a law student are glossed over, except 
to provide some perfunctory conflict between him and his girlfriend 
(also a law student). The prospect and consequence of giving up law 
school is hardly considered. Gretchen Mol looks as beautiful and 
delicate as porcelain, but she and Damon might as well be brother and 
sister in the film as lovers, such is the lack of passion between them. 
However, this is a fault of the script rather than the actors, since 
they have very little time together onscreen. </P>
<P>The supporting cast are far stronger, though Malkovich's Russian accent 
is more likely to provoke laughs than evince menace. Despite Dahl's 
attention to detail early in the movie, the film resorts to some 
standard Hollywood tricks later in the movie. Both Worm and Lester seem 
to be able to do without sleep for days at a time without feeling (or 
looking) any the worst for wear. They are both the recipients of a 
Rodney King-style beating , but are back on their feet with just a few 
scratches in the next scene. And Norton's character seems to do some 
particularly stupid things just to propel the plot to the next scene.</P>
<P>Rounders is a bit like The Cincinnati Kid or even The Color of Money 
when it should have been like The Hustler - solid without being 
unexceptional. Given the cast and the director, I would have expected 
far more.</P>
