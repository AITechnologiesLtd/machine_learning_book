<PRE>                                 FORGET PARIS
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     It is springtime and romantic comedies are in the air.  By far
the best this season is the utterly hilarious FORGET PARIS written by
Billy Crystal, Lowell Ganz, and Babaloo Mandel, among the finest comedy
writers.  It comes then as no surprise that almost every remark is
witty regardless of which of the cast utters it.  And what a cast!
Director Billy Crystal has assembled a superb group to tell this
romantic story about marriage not being quite the same as a
honeymoon.  In addition, the novelty of the film's presentation is a
unique and delightful way to tell a story.</P>
<P>     Andy and Liz (Joe Mantegna and Cynthia Stevenson) are in a
restaurant at a large table awaiting the arrival of friends who will
soon be joining them.  Andy and Liz are engaged to be married.  To pass
the time until the other guests arrive, he tells her the story of
Mickey and Ellen (Billy Crystal and Debra Winger).  As each couple
arrives,  Craig and Lucy, (Richard Mazur and Julie Kavner), Lois and
Jack (Cathy Moriarty and John Spencer), each adds a bit to the
Mickey-Ellen story.  What they tell is seen in flashbacks.</P>
<P>     Mickey is a top referee in professional basketball.  His love life
consists of the cheerleaders.  When his father dies, a cantankerous man
whom no one likes, his body in a casket is shipped to France as that
was his last will, to lie alongside his wartime buddies.</P>
<P>     Mickey sees the casket put aboard the plane's baggage dept but
when he arrives in France, the casket (and Dad) are nowhere to be
found.  Sad?  Not at all.  That is how Mickey meets Ellen who is the
American VP for the airline in Paris.  He falls madly and instantly in
love with her and a few days later, proposes.  At this point she tells
him she is married but "separated."  By the way, Dad is finally found
and buried.</P>
<P>     The film, with every moment funny, tells of their relationship.
Does she give up her great job in Paris, get divorced and come to the
U.S.?  Or should he give up the job he loves as the pro referee and
come to France to live?  The movie, always maintaining its comedic
side, tangles with this and the many other questions that arise.  It
is a beaut!</P>
<P>     In real life, Billy Crystal has been married to the same wife,
Janice, for 25 years.  They have two children.  Crystal has wanted for
a long time to make a film about what real marriage is like and he has
succeeded brilliantly even if real marriage is not as funny as the
film.</P>
