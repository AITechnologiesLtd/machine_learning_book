<PRE>Music that Floats
Legend of 1900</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>A grand piano accompanied by its carefree pianist (Tim Roth) glide like a
Ouija oracle across a glorious marble-like dance floor aboard the teetering
cruise ship Virginia. It's 1926, the savant at the keyboard is an orphan
raised by the crew whose music rages on in stormy waves; he has never set
foot on dry land.</P>
<P>The tale is a marvelous one, like a muted trumpet's melody it plays.
Conducted would be a better word than directed, the film is accented sharply
with visual and audio hits that strike at the right times. Tim Roth an
under-appreciated actor of excellence, will tickle your ivories with muse
and tug at your grand heart strings with sympathy -- portraying a pure soul
uncomplicated by cities, governments, or even an official name.</P>
<P>A coal throwing scene takes full advantage of the surround sound
capabilities today's theaters now offer. If you aren't drawn into the dark
belly of this boat by the sound of tossed charcoal, look around for a better
movie house. I would have liked to have heard this little-big film expand
its use of the multi-channeled system during musical performances as well.</P>
<P>Nearly a masterpiece, this happily embellished tour takes an odd turn just
before reaching shore, leaving me to disembark disoriented. I'd have written
an entirely different ending. Still, it is to be remembered that this is a
legend, a myth, a tale docked at the edge of the surreal.</P>
