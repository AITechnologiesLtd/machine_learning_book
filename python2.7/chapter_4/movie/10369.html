<PRE>A Review of Alien Resurrection</PRE>
<P>13 out of 29 (Expectation: 21 out of 29)</P>
<P>Boy was I disappointed.  This movie should have been called Alien
Erection.  The sex angle was interesting, but did not add to the plot.
Tried to be an analgum of the first two movies.  But instead failed on
all sides. No   suspense, sloppy character development. I was sad to see
the Mercenaries get it. They were very interesting. A movie should have
been made about them instead.</P>
<P>Wynona Rider was thoroughly miscast in this film. Although she tried
very hard, there was some very sloppy editing and dialog that made her
look really bad.  There were numerous throw backs to the other movies,
but they felt tossed in like a bad cesear salad.  If you do want see
this, just watch Sigourney Weaver and Ron Pearlman, they carry the
movie. Ron Pearlman's character was so different from Beast that I had
to laugh. It was a great change of pace for him and I hope he gets more
work.  Sigourney was terrific with a bad script. She got a chance to
play a Ripley very much different from the previous films. The ending
was totaly horrid. Although the special effects were top notch - the
final Alien was too hokey to be even laughable. The other actor that
shined for me was Brad Dourif. He has been playing these wacked out
science fiction parts lately (on Voyager for three episodes) and other
places. He is a gem.</P>
<P>Lastly, I was bummed that we didn't see more of the Aliens. When we did
see them, they were pretty cool. The full computer animation of the
aliens in the  water scene was terrfic, even though it was not very
scary. The whole movie never got my heart pumping. I hope they don't
make any more.</P>
