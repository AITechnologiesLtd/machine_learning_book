<PRE>                         THE OTHER SISTER 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1999 Timothy Voon
                    4 out of 5 for handicapped lovers</PRE>
<P>Cast: Juliette Lewis, Diane Keaton, Tom Skerritt, Giovanni Ribisi, Poppy
Montgomery, Sarah Paulson, Hector Elizondo.
Screenplay: Bob Brunner and Garry Marshall.
Producers: Mario Iscovich and Alexandra Rose.
Director: Garry Marshall</P>
<PRE>Issues:</PRE>
<P>1. The other sister is handicapped.
2. Handicapped people have feelings like ‘normal' human beings.
3. They need to love and be loved by others, as we all do.
4. They also ‘do it' (have sex). This is a valid topic and shouldn't be
subject to taboo. Although the issues of contraception should have been
more clearly brought out in the movie. But I guess there's only so much
one can explore within the boundaries of dominating mothers, lesbian
sisters and retarded boyfriends.
5. Every one has their song, and marching band music can be a real turn
on.
6. This is a romantic comedy that will bring laughter and tears to your
eyes at the same time.
7. The main actors Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi are not
handicapped in real life, although their performance may convince you
otherwise.
8. This movie should be viewed by anyone who has an unexplained fear of
disabled people.
9. This movie has more depth to it than ‘Pretty Woman'. Although I would
have loved to see Julia Roberts and Richard Gere play a retarded
prostitute and demented business man respectively.</P>
