<PRE>                          EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU
                       A film review by Ivana Redwine
                        Copyright 1997 Ivana Redwine</PRE>

<P>Imagine the enchantment of the MGM musicals of the 1930s and 1940s 
filtered through the mind of Woody Allen and what you have is EVERYONE 
SAYS I LOVE YOU. Although the musical numbers are old standards, the 
story is set in the 1990s; yet the vintage music does not seem 
incongruous with the contemporary setting. In a strange alchemy, Allen 
combines his own personal brand of angst and intellectualism with the 
lighter-than-air quality of the old musicals, and the result is a 
wonderfully romantic movie that is one of his funniest ever. </P>
<P>People tend to either love or hate Woody Allen movies, and the 
reaction to EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU is likely to be similar. I'm a 
Woody Allen fan, so it's not surprising that I loved this film and was 
swept away by its charm. It's not a perfect film, but more important 
than perfection is the feeling that stayed with me for days after 
seeing it--an almost weightless feeling of the beauty of love and the 
shortness of life. </P>
<P>All the principal actors are given at least one song, and except for 
Drew Barrymore, they do their own singing rather than have the voice 
of a professional singer dubbed in. Some of the actors, notably Goldie 
Hawn and Edward Norton, are very good singers indeed. On the other 
hand, some, particularly Woody Allen and Julia Roberts, are barely 
adequate as singers, but their songs work anyway--the movie is not 
about getting every note just right, it's about the giddy joy of 
falling in love and the bittersweet heartbreak of falling out of it. </P>
<P>Music and an ensemble performance drive the intertwined love stories, 
which revolve around the members of an extended blended family. The 
story structure is almost a dance of life that continuously circles 
around in a cycle of love found, lost, and then found again. The 
disparate story elements are unified by the use of the narrator DJ 
(newcomer Natasha Lyonne), who is the college-age daughter of Steffi 
(Goldie Hawn) by a previous marriage to Joe (Woody Allen). Like almost 
everyone else in the film, DJ is a romantic at heart who seems to be 
always falling in and out of love. In addition to narrating, she acts 
as cupid in helping Joe meet Von (Julia Roberts), a woman he has 
fallen in love with at first sight. </P>
<P>Woody Allen's Joe is not unlike characters Allen has played in the 
past, an ordinary-looking man who is angst-ridden, neurotic, and 
intellectual. When Joe breaks up with his girlfriend, he takes a trip 
to Venice with his daughter DJ to try to escape his heartache. In a 
beautiful and wistful scene, Allen half sings, half speaks "I'm 
Through With Love" while he forlornly looks out at the Grand Canal. Of 
course, he isn't through with love for long. He soon sees Von and is 
instantly smitten.</P>
<P>As luck would have it, DJ knows all about Von because DJ and her 
mischievous friends have eavesdropped on Von's therapy sessions. (The 
idea of kids eavesdropping on therapy sessions is as horrific as it is 
funny, but this is the edgy kind of humor that Allen pulls off 
beautifully.) DJ feeds her inside information to her father, and for a 
while Joe is able to transform himself into the man of Von's dreams. 
Then, in an ironic and almost karmic twist, Joe is dumped by Von. 
After having been with him, she feels that she has fulfilled her 
romantic fantasy and wants to return to her old life.</P>
<P>Another major thread in the film is the relationship between DJ's 
sister Skylar (Drew Barrymore) and her fiance Holden (Edward Norton). 
Holden seems to be just perfect for Skylar, although things don't 
always go smoothly. For example, in an attempt to be romantic when he 
proposes to her, Holden hides the engagement ring in a dessert 
parfait, only to have Skylar swallow it. Later in the film, Skylar's 
mom, who is active in supporting liberal causes, throws a party 
celebrating the release from prison of Charles Ferry (Tim Roth). 
Skylar is so attracted to Charles that she breaks her plans for the 
marriage to Holden. But don't worry, Holden won't be through with love 
for long. When Charles returns to his old criminal ways, Holden and 
Skylar reconcile.</P>
<P>Another important thread in the movie concerns the remaining 
tenderness and attraction between Joe and his ex-wife Steffi. I really 
liked this thread's bittersweet quality and gentleness. Allen and Hawn 
have a great chemistry together, especially as they dance and sing 
while taking a late night stroll in Paris along the Seine. This scene 
simply took my breath away. Wildly romantic, it is the one scene in 
the film that is most reminiscent of the grace and screen magic of the 
old musicals. The effervescence of its music and Steffi's 
gravity-defying dance make it rank with some of the best scenes of 
this genre; I'd recommend seeing this film, even if it is just to see 
this one scene alone. </P>
<P>EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU explores love as it affects the heart through 
a wide variety of ages, including even a kid's first crush. There is 
an amusing minor thread about two girls, Lane (Gaby Hoffman) and 
Laura (Natalie Portman), who both have a crush on the same boy. 
Eventually they do get to know him after following him around for 
awhile; yet, heartbreak lurks on the horizon. He asks only one of them 
out.</P>
<P>Even though EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU is funny and romantic, it is not 
all fluff. The film is at its most powerful when it acts as an almost 
cinematic equivalent of a vanitas painting, juxtaposing the beauty of 
love with the idea of mortality and the frailty of the flesh. For 
example, there is an effervescently joyous song and dance number set 
in a hospital, but the number contains harsh undercurrents. In the 
scene, doctors, nurses, patients--some of whom are bandaged or in 
wheelchairs--dance and cavort while singing "Makin' Whoopee." Another 
outstanding scene in the same vein is almost a "danse macabre" set in 
a funeral parlor where ghosts rise out of their coffins, singing and 
dancing to the tune "Enjoy Yourself (It's Later Than You Think)." </P>
<P>Allen has created some quirky and delightful characters. In addition, 
he has cast them well, which is important because the success of an 
ensemble performance depends largely on the strength of its actors. 
Part of what works in this film is that there are couples of a variety 
of ages, and for the most part these couples have the kind of 
chemistry that gives screen romance its luminescence.</P>
<P>Julia Roberts is convincing as the art historian Von, a beautiful and 
intelligent woman who becomes the focus of Joe's infatuation. She is 
perfectly cast as the kind of irresistible Goddess-like creature that 
could possibly make an ordinary guy like Joe do something as crazy and 
desperate as to try to transform himself into someone he is not. The 
relationship between Von and Joe is basically an extended one-liner, 
and Roberts has the kind of physical attractiveness and intelligence 
that makes the joke work. </P>
<P>Woody Allen as Joe is good, although this is the kind of role that he 
has done so many times that it has become almost an alter-ego for him. 
Where Allen really shines is in the scenes he shares with Goldie Hawn. 
Steffi is a wonderful, funny, and subtly dizzy character. In addition, 
Goldie Hawn is probably the best singer and dancer of the ensemble.</P>
<P>Alan Alda plays Steffi's current husband Bob, who is a slightly 
steadier and less neurotic man than ex-husband Joe. Casting is key 
here since Alda seems not to act so much as to play out facets of his 
charismatic and very funny self, and he turns out to be a rather good 
singer as well. </P>
<P>Edward Norton is wonderful as Skylar's betrothed. He obviously has 
great versatility as an actor; this is a much different role from the 
icily manipulative murder suspect that he played recently in PRIMAL 
FEAR. He truly steals the show when he sings "Just You, Just Me" to 
Skylar as they walk around New York's upper East Side during the 
film's opening sequence.</P>
<P>Tim Roth is Charles Ferry, the prisoner whose cause is championed by 
Steffi. When he comes to dinner there are some hilarious moments, 
thanks to Roth's comic gifts.</P>
<P>Natasha Lyonne sparkles both as the narrator and as Joe's biological 
daughter. She is perfectly believable in a role which in the hands of 
a lesser actress could have easily turned into little more than a 
device to unify the story. But Lyonne handles it beautifully, 
breathing life and credibility into a fanciful part.</P>
<P>Although it features flat-out gorgeous location shooting in such 
glamorous, yet real, places as New York, Paris, and Venice, this film 
and its characters belong wholly to the world of make-believe. This is 
a world where you are best friends with your ex-spouse, where the kids 
never seem to suffer any ill effects from the divorce, and where money 
is never a problem. Even the singing panhandler in the first sequence 
shot on the streets of New York is strangely non-threatening and 
better groomed than any panhandler I've seen lately. But let's face 
it, escape is the reason that many people, including me, sometimes go 
to the movies. However, Allen's trademark edginess and anxious 
intellectualism give the escapism of this film a much different flavor 
from that of the musicals produced during the Great Depression and 
World War II.</P>
<P>Although EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU is not one of Allen's deepest films, 
it is one of his most entertaining. It is a light film whose surface 
sweetness is tempered by echoes of love's potential for heartbreak and 
the impermanence of life. It is a film for Woody Allen fans and anyone 
who likes to laugh, who has been in love, or who has had a day when 
they couldn't get an old song out of their head.</P>
