Susan Granger's review of "FIRELIGHT" (Miramax Films)</PRE>
<P>         Oscar-nominated screenwriter William Nicholson ("Nell,"
"Shadowlands") makes his directorial debut with this historical
romance, starring beautiful Sophie Marceau ("Braveheart," "Anna
Karenina") as a Swiss governess who, in 1838, agrees to a secret pact
with the only son (Stephen Dillane) of a British aristocrat. He is
married to an invalid who cannot conceive and he desperately wants to
sire an heir, while she needs to pay of her father's financial
debts. They meet at a picturesque yet remote hotel in France, sharing
three days and nights of passion. Nine months pass and she gives birth
to a daughter who is immediately taken away from her. Seven years
later, she is unwittingly hired as a governess to a snobbish spoiled,
stubborn young girl (Dominique Belcourt) on a remote Sussex estate. Of
course, the hateful child is her own and the stunned aristocrat swears
her to secrecy - as their clandestine affair begins once again. With
the help of cinematographer Nic Morris, most of the pivotal scenes
take place in that haunting time when the sun has gone down and the
candles have been extinguished, creating a lush, intimate atmosphere
as flames flicker in the fireplace. This is one of those
old-fashioned, slow-moving, over-wrought bodice-rippers that once were
the staple of Gainsborough Studios in England. It's like a screen
version of a paperback Harlequin romance. On the Granger Movie Gauge
of 1 to 10, "Firelight" is a melodramatic 4, a soap opera targeted
specifically at women.</P>
