<P>   Though creating an ambiguous central character in his
most mature work, "Bamboozled," Spike Lee harbors no
ambivalence in his overall viewpoint, which (as I see it) is
this: Each period in history finds a class that oppresses and a
group that is oppressed.  The oppressed may freely parody
the actions of the people in power.  Satire is a creative way
of deflating the powerful with ridicule.  Satire, however, is
inexcusable if used by the strong against the weak.  If white
people in general have the upper hand against black people,
they may not in good conscience use their power to poke fun
at African-Americans.  Whites may, however, mock other
whites, which makes movies like "The Three Stooges"
permissible.  Whites may not ethically have anything to do
with subjugating members of minority groups--who have
traditionally been on the raw end of the stick throughout U.S.
history.  </P>
<P>   To illustrate his viewpoint long and hard but with a great
deal of laughter and general entertainment value, Lee poses
a scenario in which the white vice president of a major TV
network, Dunwitty (Michael Rapaport), concerned about the
plummeting ratings of his station, encourages his one black
writer, Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans) to push the
envelope.  Delacroix, a successful, Harvard-educated man
with an affected upper-class accent, is sufficiently humiliated
with his role at a network that has little room for African-
Americans on its staff to want out.  Since he cannot violate
his contract by quitting, he creates a show that is politically
so outrageously incorrect that he expects the pilot to be
rejected and presumes that he will be canned without
violating his employment agreement.  Trouble ensues when
the program instead becomes a huge hit.</P>
<P>   What Delacroix has done is to create essentially a minstrel
show, the type of entertainment that began in the U.S. in
1840 in which blacks are stereotyped as ignorant and willing
to follow the orders of the ruling whites without question. 
(The show is so politically incorrect that in fact the New York
Times refused to accept advertising from the studio that
features African-Americans in blackface as "too demeaning.") 
Delacroix hires a couple of desperate individuals, Manray
(Savion Glover) and Womack (Tommy Davidson), a street-
peddling tap dancer and his promoter respectively, giving
them roles as Mantan and Sleep 'n' Eat, and taping a weekly
show with stage characters in blackface in historically
debasing characterizations--including a band of pickaninnies
and Alabama Porch Monkeys who eat watermelon with gusto
and dance up a storm.  As the program soars in ratings,
Delacroix becomes more conflicted, torn between his hatred
of his own father's humiliating role as a stand-up, black-
hating comic, his mother's race-conscious conscience, and
the increasing disgust of his attractive assistant, Sloan
Hopkins (Jada Pinkett-Smith.</P>
<P>   Regardless of our antipathy toward the long abandoned era
of blackface, Aunt Jemimas, and the slew of cartoons (which
Lee trots out with relish toward the conclusion of the film), we
in the audience cannot help being entertained by what
transpires on the stage and to be absorbed in the backstage
manipulations of the writer, his boss, and a group of so-called
Mau Maus headed by Big Black (Mos Def) who are
absolutely appalled by the degradation they witness from
Delacroix's performers on TV.  There is little doubt where
Spike Lee's sympathies lie, and while the Mau Maus
ultimately take extreme action to end the successful TV
series, Mr. Lee is obviously furious at the entire chronicle of
white exploitation of blacks and by blacks who allow
themselves to be manipulated by taking part in the designs of
the so-called ruling class.  We suspect that even a program
that many would consider fairly innocuous like The Jeffersons
would strike a sour note in Lee's consciousness but that a
production such as The Cosby Show would be more to his
liking.  As Lee ultimately demonstrates in his movie, the
blacks who take part in the designs of white TV producers
very much share in the guilt.  "There is always a choice,"
says one of the characters, and we do see indications that at
least one of the performers in the network weekly series is
perfectly willing to give up his perks and return to a life of
integrity and poverty.</P>
<P>   Lee's principal flaw this time around is his lack of
cohesiveness in designing a movie that plays more like a
series of fun skits than a solid narrative.  Repeating the acts
of the pickaninnies and the principal players over and over
gains no additional points for Mr. Lee and in fact the overkill
takes away from his contentions as does the contrived,
melodramatic ending.  Damon Wayans is particularly notable
in demonstrating a direction that tears him apart on the one
hand in his liking for material success and on the other by his
collaboration with the power structure in degrading his
people.  Other stand-outs are Savion Glover, who taps up a
storm as he did on Broadway recently in "Noise/Funk" and
Michael Rapaport as the white vice president who feels he
has the right to use the "N" word because his wife is black
and his kids are bi-racial.  Johnnie Cochran and Al Sharpton
make cameo appearances as themselves, rallying the troops
against the reactionary TV series.  The film could have been
better with more attention to structure and a more generous
use of the editor's shears.</P>
