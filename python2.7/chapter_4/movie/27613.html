<PRE>"Chocolat" - A Semisweet Fable</PRE>
<P>Once upon a time in a little French village, a "sly
wind blew in from the north."  With it came a radiant
woman named Vianne (Juliette Binoche) who would
descend upon the sleepy hamlet.  Through her own
unique brand of wide-eyed optimism and a delectable
recipe for making savory chocolate candies, she would
instill a new sense of life into its soporific
citizens.  </P>
<P>Some, however, saw her as a threat to the village's
tranquility.   This place, lifted from the pages of a
fairy tale book, seems to have been untouched by the
passage of time.  And the morally staunch Mayor Compte
de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) wanted to make sure that
its sanctity would remain intact.  To him, she was a
Succubus who brought temptation.  Vianne would
politely decline to go to church although everyone
else in the village would attend.  She also opens up
her chocolate shop during Lent, creating an
uncomfortable challenge to the citizens as they pass
by.  The wonderfully decorated window display, filled
with her delightful array of confections, could easily
turn anybody's head.  Needless to say, the Mayor was
not pleased.</P>
<P>On the surface, "Chocolat" is a fairly sweet drama
about how Vianne struggles to gain acceptance in a
village that has trouble accepting outsiders.  But
beneath its sugarcoated surface, the story is a
parable about the forces of Christianity that battle
the forces of paganism.  </P>
<P>Here, Christianity and the Mayor are portrayed as
prudish concepts that extol discipline and reverence. 
The Mayor has a narrow view about how things should be
done.  He even goes so far as to edit all of the
sermons that are given in Church.  Of course, most of
the language has been altered to indirectly denounce
the presence of Vianne and her shop.  But his sermons
are no match for Vianne's mysterious chocolate
creations.  The town soon finds her shop to be
something of a clinic for their vapid souls.  There's
something magical about the cacao powder that she
uses.  But the movie never elaborates on whether she
is an evil priestess or whether she has some kind of
hidden agenda.  But it is clear that she does
represent paganism, from the lavish decorum in her
shop to her off-the-shoulder outfits to her status as
an unwed mother to her attraction with a raffish boat
captain (Johnny Depp).  Whatever great power she may
possess, she seems just fine dispensing advice along
with her chocolates.</P>
<P>As a result, good things begin to happen.  Many
villagers benefit from its effects in one way or
another.  Even the Mayor is affected.  But, the most
tender subplot involves the divide between a cranky
grandmother (Judi Dench) and her daughter (Carrie
Anne-Moss).  </P>
<P>Despite its allegorical references, the film opts to
be more of a whimsical fairy tale rather than an
ambitious piece of work.  The majority of the film,
for example, takes place in two or three locations
giving it the feel of an off-Broadway production. 
Meanwhile, most of the screentime is focused on
dialogue exchanged between Vianne and those that she
has touched.  Although the ensemble performance made
this movie enjoyable on its own sweet level, the drama
didn't nearly have the potency of Vianne's chocolates.
 Some of that magic was needed to make this a truly
memorable film.  </P>
