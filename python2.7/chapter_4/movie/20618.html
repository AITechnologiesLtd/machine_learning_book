<P>What can really be said about "For Love of the Game," Kevin Costner's third 
(and most likely final) film in his "Baseball Trilogy," aside from that 
Costner probably should have stopped while he was ahead? Mixing every cliche 
that could possibly have been dreamt up, the film is such a sappy, 
self-important mess that, by the time the supposed-to-be moving climax 
crawled around, I almost felt physically sick by the overpowering syrup that 
had been thrust upon me in the last 138 minutes. Moving at a lugubrious, 
needlessly slow pace, and with characters that couldn't possibly be any less 
underwritten and lifeless, the film is ultilmately a cinematic dead zone, and 
one of the most ineptly-written high-profile pictures of the year. The fact 
that Sam Raimi, director of 1982's cult horror classic, "The Evil Dead," and 
1998's taut thriller, "A Simple Plan," is at the helm here only disheartens 
you to an even greater extent.</P>
<P>"For Love of the Game" is a flashback-laden heart-tugger (read: 
patience-puller) with one of the most drug-out framing devices I have seen. 
Beginning in NYC where 40-year-old pro baseball player for the Detroit 
Tigers, Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner), is set to take on the Yankees, he 
unexpectedly has an early-morning confrontation with his girlfriend of five 
years, Jane Aubrey (Kelly Preston), who tells him that she is taking a job in 
London, and will be on the six o'clock flight out of New York. Later, Billy 
discovers that the Tigers have been sold, and his contract has run out, so 
this impending game with the Yankees quickly is transformed into a 
life-altering moment for him. A lot is riding on him pitching well, and as 
the crowds from the stands yell out to him that his career is over, the first 
of about six or seven elongated flashbacks begin (and this is at least at the 
30-minute mark!). Oh, it almost slipped my mind; while waiting on her delayed 
flight at the airport, Jane can't seem to escape the game that is playing on 
every television in the lobby and cafe, and reluctantly is swept away in it, 
along with just about every other person in the whole airport. Exchanging her 
flight for a later one so she can see the last few innings, Jane begins to 
have doubts if she should even leave, after all. To make a long story short, 
the flashbacks begin five years before, when Billy and Jane first meet and 
hop into bed together that same night. Because of his constant moving-around 
due to his profession, Jane only gets to see him once every few weeks or even 
months, and, truth be told, they don't really seem to ever even like each 
other, but they stick things out--through the good and the bad. All of this 
takes place in the first year or two after they meet; the next three years 
that led up to the present-day story, however, are practically skipped over, 
and the conclusion, which you will be able to predict from the first five 
minutes, includes Billy winning the big game, his own self-worth, and, yep, 
you guessed it, the girl. </P>
<P>If Kevin Costner really does have a love for the game of baseball, why would 
he agree to make something so shamelessly weepy and manipulative, in which 
not more than one or two scenes are even credible, and the rest is pure 
fantasy-land? The baseball game sequences are overblown and offensively 
exploitative, just in order to get the audience to cry from sympathy, and 
then joy. Instead of giving the viewer the benefit of the doubt that they 
will be able to figure out Billy's inner conflict, screenwriter Dana Stevens 
deserves to be locked in a vault somewhere, as two sport commentators are 
written to say things like, "40-year-old Billy Chapel is pitching against 
time," as the music score swells and the last inning comes to a close. After 
winning, we get shots of Yankees fans who had previously been hounding him, 
say things like, "You pitched alright, Billy Chapel. You did good!" [Insert 
rolling of eyes and smacks to the forehead here]. Do Stevens or director Sam 
Raimi actually believe that they made a worthy film that is truthful to the 
characters and the story? If so, their views are severely distorted from 
reality.</P>
<P>If the sports scene are inanely-portrayed, the romance flashbacks aren't much 
better. Instead of developing the relationship between Billy and Jane, what 
we get is one make-out/mild bed scene right at the start, and in almost every 
other scene between the two, they are either fighting or arguing or the 
subjects of an elaborate music montage that signals the passing of time. 
Since there are no less than five montages in the film, shouldn't Billy and 
Jane have been old, gray-haired fogies by the climax? Scene after scene we 
watch these two attractive stars, but without a trace of any sharp writing to 
support them, aside from conversations that are linked exclusively to the 
plot, what we really have are two attractive stars who have zero chemistry 
and are so dull and uninteresting as individuals that pairing them up means 
only one thing: a motion picture disaster.</P>
<P>Kevin Costner is adequate as Billy Chapel, who has "mid-life crisis" written 
over his forehead like a neon sign, but why should we care about someone with 
no distinguishable qualities or interests, outside of baseball? Kelly 
Preston, an underrated actress whom I have defended several times with her 
last few pictures, finally has a real clunker here. Obviously some of the 
fault must lie in Raimi's first real embarrassing directing job, but Preston 
overacts and whines her way through her non-descript role, and is so annoying 
that I can't believe anyone would be able to stand being around her character 
of Jane for longer than five minutes, let alone five years! Always off on 
trips, when we find that Jane actually has a teenage daughter, Heather (Jena 
Malone), midway through, it comes as somewhat of a surprise. Frantically 
calling Billy up on the phone, Jane tells him that Heather has run away to 
her father's home in Boston. Weighing in all the evidence, I don't blame 
Heather, as her mother obviously doesn't care about her, and is always 
skipping town, leaving her home by herself for long periods of time. 
Additionally, Jane literally only says two lines to Heather, her very own 
daughter, in the whole film: "Don't ever run away again," and, "Would you 
like some spaghetti?" That's it, and I'm not exaggerating. </P>
<P>As Heather, Jena Malone (1998's "Stepmom") gives the only performance in the 
film that is worth mentioning in a positive manner. At only 13 or 
14-years-old, Malone is believable as she ages in the film from a young teen 
to a college student, and is given the one and only good scene, in which she 
spots Billy while at the University of South Carolina, and has a brief, warm 
exchange of words with him. So strong is Malone, in fact, that it is sorely 
disappointing to find that she is otherwise wasted and thrown to the 
way-side, so that we can instead watch two dim-witted stick figures fall 
(artificially) in love.  </P>
<P>"For Love of the Game" piles on the cheese and corn and honey-sap so thickly 
that the film, at times, seems to be in danger of being smothered to death, 
which would have been fine with me. Without anything smart, witty, exciting, 
or truly romantic to offer, one is left wondering not only who the film was 
made for (only the most undiscriminating viewers could be won over by this 
"product-on-autopilot"), but what exactly the point was. In a late scene in 
which Billy sits on a bed and weeps, we are supposed to feel sorry for him, 
but why? A popular veteran baseball player who has just won the game of his 
life, should we come to the conclusion that he is crying for Jane, and if so, 
why? She has no admirable personality traits, and he would be better off 
without such an uptight priss. Of course, I could also say he has no 
admirable personality traits, and she would be better off without such an 
uptight priss. The only question that "For Love of the Game" left me 
pondering was, how are we supposed to care about two central characters who 
would be far better off joining screenwriter Dana Stevens? You know, locked 
away in that vault I mentioned. </P>
