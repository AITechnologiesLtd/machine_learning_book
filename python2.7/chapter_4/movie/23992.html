<PRE>APRILE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Set against the backdrop of a change in the Italian government and of
the birth of his son, Nanni Moretti's APRILE stars himself as a neurotic
filmmaker.  Moretti can best be thought of as an Italian Woody Allen.</P>
<P>Where the two directors differ is that Moretti seems so constantly and
incurably happy that it is hard to take his complaints seriously.  (I
once found myself teaching an overcrowded course at Berkeley, so I
warned my students on the first day how tough I would be and suggested
that they take the less crowded section that followed mine.  I was
astonished to find the class just as full on the second day.  As the
students told me later, they didn't believe me because I was too nice.
So it is with Moretti, which takes much of the sting out of his caustic
comedy.)</P>
<P>Some of the film's most endearing images are those of Moretti with his
infant son.  As the baby wails, Moretti doesn't know what to do.  A
mother can supply milk to quiet the child, but a father has no such
weapon in his arsenal.  What he can do, Moretti figures, is promise
material goods.  "Don't cry like that," he tells his son.  "I'll buy you
a scooter the moment you turn 14."</P>
<P>Among the many scenes that don't work is one involving a bowl of pasta
that doesn't appear hot.  One of Moretti's assistants on the documentary
tries to blow cigarette smoke over the pasta, but it looks fake.  Much
of the movie's humor comes across as cold as the pasta.</P>
<P>Part of the film's humor surrounds Moretti's insecurity.  He worries
that his documentaries will not let him say what he wants to say.  He is
even more concerned that he doesn't have anything to say in the first
place.</P>
<P>Another theme is his procrastination.  An obsessive letter writer about
the political situation in Italy, he never gets around to sending these
missives.  He decides instead to take them to Hyde Park in London.
There, among a group of noisy preachers, he reads his letters in Italian
to a quizzical crowd.</P>
<P>As the frustrated Moretti films his documentary, his mind strays to the
film he really wants to be making instead -- a colorful musical set in
the 1950s about a Trotskyite chef.  At the end of APRILE, we get to
watch a little bit of this fun little farce being filmed.  This is the
movie that I wish he had made rather than APRILE.</P>
<P>Although APRILE may find resonance among Italians, much of its humor
went past this American.  It may be that understanding the nuances of
the Italian political parties would have helped.  Or perhaps Moretti is
simply an acquired taste.</P>
<P>APRILE runs 1:18.  The movie is in Italian with English subtitles.  It
is not rated but might be PG-13 for some language and one brief scene of
pot smoking and would be acceptable for kids around 11 and up.</P>
<P>The film will be playing as part of the San Francisco International Film
Festival (<A HREF="http://www.sfiff.org">http://www.sfiff.org</A>), which runs April 20 to May 4, 2000.
It does not have a United States distributor.</P>
