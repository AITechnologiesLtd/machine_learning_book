Sutherland, Embeth Davidtz, James Gandolfini, Elias Koteas</P>
<P>   Two cops discover a dead body in a bathtub. One says to
the other, "He had no friends and no family," to which the
other responds, "Then why is he dead?"  That modest gag
constitutes just about the only humor in "Fallen," a deadly
serious movie that combines the police and horror genres in a
complicated--some would say convoluted--plot that deals with
some mighty large philosophic issues.  Those metaphysical
concerns center on the nature of good and evil and even the
meaning of existence.  John Hobbes (Denzel Washington)
even asks his partner and fellow detective Jonesy (John
Goodman), "Why are we here?"  If that's not especially
original, it signals the film's lofty inquiry, not the sort of stuff
generally treated in a Hollywood studio movie.</P>
<P>   "Fallen" might easily be considered a parable of good and
evil, particularly the struggle each of us has with these two
qualities with which we'll born, assuming our name is not
Mother Teresa.  Those of us whose souls are heavy with
goodness will probably not succumb to greed; those infested
with evil will be wind up in jail or worse.  If "Fallen" were an
Everyman story, writer Nicholas Kazan (best known for his
script to "Reversal of Fortune") and director Gregory Hoblit
(formerly at the helm of "Primal Fear") are positioning
Detective Hobbes as a combination of good and evil
immersed in the struggle between the two, Gretta Milano
(Embeth Davidtz) as a professor of theology who is all-good;
and Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) as evil incarnate.</P>
<P>  Borrowing from such horror, police, and sci-fi thrillers as
"Seven," "The Exorcist" and "The X-Files," director Hoblit uses
Hobbes to narrate the tale, a story of the time, the cop tells
us, that he almost died; and is in effect a flashback to a
troubled time in a Pennsylvania police precinct.  In an over-
the-top prelude, Edgar Reese is about to be executed in the
gas chamber.  Agreeing to make a videotaped documentary
in which his arresting officer Hobbes meets with him hours
before, Reese extends his hand to Hobbes and mumbles
what appears to be gibberish but turns out to be a 2,000-year
old language combining Syrian with Aramaic.  He goes to his
death singing the Stones' "Time is On My Side," a song which
can be taken literally and which is sung by a number of
people throughout the two-hour film.  When other bodies are
found in bathtubs, Hobbes conducts an investigation which
leads him into the world of the occult, taking him to a cabin in
which a decorated officer apparently shot himself some thirty
years back and as well to that cop's daughter, Gretta (Embeth
Davidtz), who portentously warns Hobbes to walk away from
the case.</P>
<P>   "Fallen" features scenes in a police station and in Hobbes'
home that give us insight into the life of this obsessed man,
providing realistic dialogue among detectives and a touch of
sentimentality as we watch Hobbes' loving relationship with
his brother Art (Gabriel Casseus) and his cute nephew Sam
(MIchael J. Pagan).  </P>
<P>   Since "Fallen" is so derivative of similar movies, little occurs
that is unexpected.  Many moviegoers will predict the twist
that occurs near the conclusion and which seems to foretell at
least one sequel to the movie.  What makes the film
particularly worth watching is the magnetic presence of
Denzel Washington as a good guy who had recently given up
smoking (winning himself points in that eternal human
struggle between the forces of purity and wickedness) but
who replaces the weed with chewing gum (making him lose a
percentage of those points).  The picture, at two hours, is
longer than it should be, particularly since it is not freighted
with the twists and turns that keep an audience at the edge of
their seats.  On the whole it's too serious, even pompous, for
its own good.  The acting all-around is fine, with professional
performances by John Goodman and Donald Sutherland and
an authoritative turn by Embeth Davidtz as the somber
professor who is ironically too good to touch 
Rated R.  Running Time: 120 minutes.  (C) 1998 Harvey
