<PRE>³ Fight Club ³         * * * *</PRE>
<P>     Granted:  you¹ve never seen anything quite like FIGHT
CLUB.  Based on the cerebral, kick-ass novel by Chuck
Palahniuk, CLUB takes on a slew of issues, ranging from
materialism to moral decay.  It is visually stunning, quick,
smart, stimulating, a visceral powerhouse.  But, the film seems
to meander; too many themes bouncing off one another, priorities
misplaced, characters wandering aimlessly between brutal hand-
to-hand choreography and passive philosophizing.  There¹s
terrific material, here, let it be said -- just, a bit on the
disorganized side.</P>
<P>And, then I went back.  Had to; less intoxicated.  Bits
and pieces stuck with me as great, but not the whole, which
kind of baffled me since I absolutely loved the book.  Watching
a second time, the film is still scatterbrain.  It¹s also
spectacular cinema. Boldly directed by David Fincher (SEVEN is
one of the best, genre redefining, ever) -- a filmmaker who
consistently tests the limits of his medium -- FIGHT CLUB
focuses on insomniac every-man Narrator (Edward Norton, in a
performance that is nothing short of amazing) and his inadvertant
quest for self-improvement.  He starts with support groups, of
all disease and abnormality, where a hug from someone worse off
than you is just the thing for a good night¹s sleep.  Meets
Marla (a wild eyed Helena Bonham-Carter), who goes for the free
coffee, plus it¹s less expensive than movies; a ³faker².  Then,
Tyler (another of our best and brightest, Brad Pitt), a social
nuisance who sells homemade soap at twenty bucks a bar to
finance militant uprising.  Narrator, or Jack, makes his most
resolute bond with Tyler; ³How much can you know about yourself
if you¹ve never been in a fight?²  They beat the shit out of
each other, one night, in a parking lot and come to share the
same primal instinct:  emotional release via bodily harm.  As
Tyler puts it, you hit rock bottom when, and only if, you push
yourself physically beyond yourself, to rise above.  Spiritual
discovery, if you will; pain equals destruction, and destruction
equals awakening.  He¹s the rebellious alter ego to Jack, and
anyone for that matter daring enough to lose everything in order
to gain control.  Because, once you¹ve gotten low as you can
possibly get, the only direction is up.  Point taken.  That
perspective made him an intriguing character in Palahniuk¹s
brilliant novel, and it works, here, as well.</P>
<P>Both relationships mesmerize, and the ultra-faithful
script by Jim Uhl¹s is quirky, witty and biting.  Not to mention
stunningly funny.  You can forget subtlety, though; FIGHT CLUB¹s
grim and abrasive, virulent on top of its sometimes easy-goingness.
Wouldn¹t have it any other way.  A ³three pitcher² bout amongst
friends draws attention, and quickly becomes Saturday night
ritual, relocated to bar basements where men join willingly to
pulverize one another.  No membership fees; each man, regardless
how worthless or respectable his lot in life, deific for a moment
or two of bare fisted suffering.  A sensation that turns into a
nationwide thing, existing ³between the hours fight club starts
and the hours after fight club ends² according to Norton¹s droll,
eloquent voice-over.  Because, the first rule is... blah, blah.</P>
<P>What¹s great about the novel (one thing, anyway) and here,
too, is that these savage little get togethers are a starting
place for something on more grand a scale.  Recruitment for
vandals and nihilists who believe ³losing all hope² is freedom.
Tyler starts Project Mayhem, and passes out homework assignments
which include initiating random fights.  Funny montage.  And,
how could you not like Jack¹s contribution to the cause -- a
memorable scene, where Norton kicks his own ass before his
traumatized boss, leading to ³corporate sponsorship².</P>
<P>It¹s about damning the consumer mentality, getting a new
perspective, ³finding something out².  FC also has perhaps the
most playful story about the human psyche I¹ve ever seen, and
a realistic depiction of insomnia (ever had it, then you know).
³Nothing¹s real² is true; wastebasket contents and airplane food
take on a certain strange profound meaning.  ³You¹re never really
asleep, and you¹re never really awake², and hallucinations are
not unlikely.  Tyler may be one.  Jack may.  Lose sleep, days
on end, you get a distinct sense of futility, like nothing you
thought mattered really does.  You look for purpose; significance
in the world.  Anything to give yourself reprieve; God, I¹ve
been there.  Which is why Jack becomes a junkie to twelve-step
meetings.  Why he
listens to his inner misfit, gives his undivided attention (for
a while) and follows orders.  Seriously:  when¹s the last time
two sides of the same personality were this fully characterized?</P>
<P>Wasn¹t sure how Fincher and team would pull off the infamous
plot twist, but... damn, job well done.  Allusion is perfection,
as with Jack thinking aloud during his solo tussle, ³For some
reason, I was reminded of my first fight with Tyler.²  Marla¹s
morning-after comment to Jack, ³I can hardly believe anything
about last night.²  A sex scene, in suspended animation, that
blurs the man¹s face.  Or, one of Norton¹s very first lines in
the film:  ³I know this, because Tyler knows this.²  Fun stuff,
even if you already know what¹s going down.</P>
<P>Acting-wise?  What can you say..  Pitt¹s an experimentalist,
which fits in, whatever the project (MEET JOE BLACK excepted).
He takes risks, and you sense it every second he¹s on screen.
Brit-beauty Carter -- accent gone, lady-like demeanor trashed --
isn¹t so much in a performance, as a character sketch, but it
works.  I liked her scenes with Norton; the way he hasn¹t caught
on, yet, and treats her by turns coldly and with affection.  She
doesn¹t push it, or overplay.  She¹s manic, alright, but not out
of context.  Plus, as Marla, grunge never looked so delectable
(nor has it made me want a cigarette more in my life).  Then,
there¹s Edward Norton.  Enough can¹t be said about his work in
FIGHT CLUB, so I¹ll simply put it:  if no Academy notice comes
of what he has done in this film, consider the lot of them
unconscious.  He is out there, charismatic, assailable, naive,
alive with screen presence and non-assumption.  Beside giving
one of the best movie narrations (second only to Ray Liotta, in
GOODFELLAS), he nails every nuance of the character from
Palahniuk¹s scathing novel, and then some.  His scenes with
Carter, Jack defensive when Marla invades his space, are humorous
and kind of sexy.  They split up nights at therapy, so neither
gets exposed; he is resentful, because she sees through him,
and protective of his territory (³This chick, Marla Singer,
did not have testicular cancer.²) but drawn to her, also,
because she¹s kindred.  Same respect:  Norton and Pitt have
chemistry to spare.  Much of their time spent is gruesome -- one
scene, with Pitt drizzling blood on a man¹s face, is gory
beyond words; another, Norton pummeling a helpless youngster
into oblivion, features about the queasiest close-up of a mangled
face as I think I¹ve ever seen.  But, both stars shine in quieter
moments, like their first meeting on a plane, and later when
they make liposuctioned fat soap together.  Big names; no egos.</P>
<P>From its brain-tour opener (and BTW, one of these days,
cool title sequences are going to be refered to as Fincherian),
backed by a driving Dust Brothers selection, on, the furiously
entertaining FIGHT CLUB has masterpiece written all over it.
Unanswered questions?  You bet¹cha.  If Tyler knows what he is,
what¹s the ultimate goal?  Just cause chaos and/or remake Jack
from the inside out?  And, where _did_ Jack learn to make explosives
that way?  Was he born knowing it and didn¹t realize or start
utilizing the technique till now, what?</P>
<PRE>Still, classic shit.</PRE>
<PRE>     Best line:  ³I don¹t wanna die without scars.²             </PRE>
