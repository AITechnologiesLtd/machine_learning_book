<PRE>                                  TREES LOUNGE
                       A film review by Serdar Yegulalp
                        Copyright 1997 Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: Steve Buscemi's excellent directorial debut, mapping the territory
of a career drinker whose life has gone off the rails. Wry and intelligent,
and not more than a little sad.</P>
<P>The first time we see Tommy, he's zonked in a booth at closing time in the
bar that he lives above. The barmaid gives him a kick -- hard enough to wake
him up, not hard enough to actually hurt the guy. We somehow sense they have
done this before. Tommy (an excellent Steve Buscemi) is a career drinker, a
man whose life has turned bit by bit into applied research on the effects of
inebriation. Only natural since everything else in his life has failed him.
Anyone who thinks barflys are romantic, somehow, need to meet a few.</P>
<P>Tommy, like many career drinkers, is determined not to let himself be blamed
for anything. Sure enough, the next day, he's scoping out his former boss
and girlfriend. Sure he embezzled from the guy and blew the wad in Atlantic
City, but he made his girl dump him and then married her, the bastard! And
the more we watch Tommy, the more we despair of him ever really shifting out
of neutral and doing anything genuine with his life.</P>
<P>All of this may make TREES LOUNGE sound impossibly depressing. It's not.
Buscemi, as director and screenwriter, has found just the right tone for
this story -- a kind of wryness, a deadpan humor that's not without a little
sadness. Another director would film this kind of material as all-out
melodrama, with D.T.s and hysterics and God knows what else. Buscemi has
apparently lived through a good deal of what he puts on the screen, and so
keeps everything on a firmly realistic level. He knows what fits and what
doesn't.</P>
<P>I love movies like this. They take a gallery of sharply defined characters
and let them be themselves, instead of dropping them into a stupid prefab
plot. There is a plot in the movie, but it comes as a natural outgrowth of
what the characters do, not as a way of forcing something to happen. Mike
Leigh is another director who has this kind of approach; his NAKED worked in
roughly the same way, but was far less forgiving. TREES LOUNGE is more
careful and sad than bitter, but is still good at showing us why some people
just never seem to get a toehold.</P>
<P>Tommy solves his problem of a job by driving an ice cream truck, taking the
route that belonged to a beloved relative (just before he dropped dead of a
heart attack). He meets a precocious young girl named Debbie (Chloe Sevigny,
also in KIDS), and they seem to hit it off well, but Tommy is
pathologically incapable of accepting any responsibility.</P>
<P>We've known people like Tommy. God knows I have, and that's the key to the
movie's success. Tommy's answer to life is to get another drink -- not even
as a kind of oblivion, the way one of his septuagenarian bar buddies does
throughout the movie, but just as a way of finding a familiar piece of
terrain. He's more at home with the bottle than he is with another human
being, and he's not alone -- there are other denizens of the Trees who are
no less screwed-up, but that doesn't mean Tommy has a support structure or
anything. In the end, it's just him and his bottle of beer and bourbon.
Again. And it's his own damn fault.</P>
