<P>   Have you ever felt imprisoned in your own body, wishing
that you could go somewhere else like a member of the
witness protection program with a new name, new job and
even a new personality?  Have you ever tried with unfailing
energy to get another person to see things your way: to get
the promotion you want, the romantic attachment you crave,
the organization you've always wanted to join?  How far
would you be willing to go to make money; that is, would you
be agreeable to invading a person's privacy by setting up a
telescope in your office and soliciting fees from people who
want to look into the rooms of the buildings across the street? 
Have you ever wanted to be famous, not just for fifteen
minutes, but to be the sort who'd have to wear sunglasses
just to take a walk around the block lest you be swamped by
autograph hounds?  Finally, have you ever been annoyed by
people who ask you questions like these?</P>
<P>   Chances are good that your answer is yes to all of the
above.  That's the nature of the beast: to want what the other
guy has, to be what the other fellow is, if only for a while. 
There's a movie out there that explores all of these big
themes and does so in ways that make it not only
hands-down the most original cinematic work of the year but
one of the most absorbing, amusing, and thought-provoking. 
"Being John Malkovich" plays around with The Big Issues Of
Our Time And Every Other: Identity, Manipulation, and Ethics. 
That's quite a tall order for a film that's under two hours in
duration, but "Being John Malkovich," one of the favorites of
the recent New York Film Festival, succeeds in doing all this
while combining the genres of science fiction, romantic
comedy, and psychological thriller.  </P>
<P>   Surprisingly, this work of utter singularity comes from the
helmsmanship of a first-time movie director, Spike Jonze,
heretofore known principally for his work as a maker of music
videos and for his role as Private Conrad Vig in David O.
Russell's "Three Kings."  Using the talents of performers who
are easily recognized for their commercial movies--John
Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Charlie Sheen; and those better
known for their employment in the indies such as Catherine
Keener, John Malkovich, Mary Kay Place, and Orson
Beene--Jonze brings Charlie Kaufman's screenplay to vivid,
surreal life.  Though the final one-third of the story becomes
convoluted after the introduction of far too many people,
overall the wit, the novelty, the risk-taking make this a
must-see experience, a welcome change of pace from
Hollywood's diet of predictable, formulaic, feel-good fare.</P>
<P>  The story opens on a dazzling performance of puppetry by
Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) whose job offers are too few
and far betweeeen, relegated to second-string status by a
gimmicky puppeteer who draws the crowds to shows
involving a 60-foot tall statue.  Encouraged to look for a job
by his ditzy wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz)--who runs a pet store
and keeps a neurotic monkey in their home--he answers an
ad requesting a fellow with fast fingers for filing.  The office is
on floor 7-1/2, and has a four-foot ceiling--to keep its
overhead low, according to the boss, Dr. Lester (Orson
Bean).  Craig gets the job, begins to flirt fruitlessly with a
co-worker, Maxine (Catherine Keener), and soon has dinner
with his carrot-juice-addicted employer who, he learns, is 105
years old.  (The key to the plot, as we find out later, is that
carrot juice is not the secret of his longevity, but that a
periodic change of identity is.)</P>
<P>   The fun comes partly from dialogue that could have been
stolen from Saturday Night Live, as when Craig attempts to
communicate with a secretary who has a form of dyslexia of
the ear. But most of the amusement is visual.  Craig
discovers a secret tunnel behind a filing cabinet that leads
directly into the head of John Malkovich.  Anyone who crawls
through the passage enters the actor's top, sees life through
Malkovich's eyes, and is spit out in 15 minutes onto a grassy
area overlooking the New Jersey Turnpike.  The plot thickens
when Craig's wife and his co-worker Maxine form a sexual
attachment much to the dismay of the man who wants
Maxine for himself, leading Craig to manipulate events inside
John Malkovich's head to trick Maxine into thinking that he is
really Lotte.</P>
<P>   Themes involving mistaken identity have been milked for
laughs ever since the days of Greek theater, later reinforced
by the Elizabethans before becoming a staple of modern
comedy.  But not even Shakespeare would have come up
with the wild and woolly developments of this parody, which
among other themes tackles the very making of movies itself. 
When Craig finds that his skill as a puppeteer comes in extra
handy in this case, he becomes like a film director,
manipulating John Malkovich to do his bidding.  And when
Lotte takes on the identity of John Malkovich, she assumes
the role of the actor, one who may be mousey in real life but
aggressive and sensual when performing in the guise of a
wholly different person.</P>
<P>   As if the originality of this plot were not enough, "Being
John Malkovich" benefits from some surprisingly adept
acting by people relatively unknown such as Orson Bean
(who had once written a book popularizing the ideas
of psychologist Wilhelm Reich) as the lecherous 105-year-old
boss, and Catherine Keener, who was equally dependable as
the cynical wife of Ben Stiller in Neil LaBute's "Your Friends
and Neighbors."  Cameron Diaz, virtually unrecognizable in a
frizzy brown wig, eschews her usual sexy characteristics and
comes across wonderfully as the frustrated woman who
realizes that she would like to become a transsexual; and
John Cusack is super as the nerdy fellow as frustrated in the
bedroom as in the board room who ultimately overcomes his
helplessness in both areas.  Though many in the audience
may not have seen John Malkovich in other films (he
performed in the arty "Dangerous Liaisons" and is a quirky
man indeed in the upcoming "The Messenger"), few are likely
to forget him after watching him show us that actors, like
normal human beings, eat toast in the morning, become
confused quite often, and are generally at least as vulnerable
as the rest of us.</P>
