<P>"Toy Story" is a good movie that remembers the fun and simplicity of
children's stories but adds an intelligent, mature theme that everyone will
love. It tells an innocent, plausible story about toys who come to life when
no one's around.</P>
<P>The entire film is composed of computer-generated animation, and it is the
exquisite detail that makes the film work so well. Tom Hanks stars as the
voice of Woody, a talking cowboy rag doll who happens to be Andy's (the
little boy who owns all the toys) favorite toy. Every single line he says has
reason and purpose, not so much to build character or make for plot, but just
to tell the story. It's adorable to watch him act as a leader because he
seems so mature and intelligent for just a toy.</P>
<P>A big problem occurs when Andy gets the latest, coolest toy for his birthday
- a Buzz Lightyear Space Ranger action figure (voiced by Allen), who has
lasers, wings, and a voice chip! When Buzz introduces himself to the group he
actually believes he's a space ranger, the other toys think so too, except
for Woody. </P>
<P>There are many funny scenes between Woody and Buzz as they fight for the
"favorite toy" position. But what's also great is Woody's cynicism as he
tries to explain to Buzz that he's just a toy and not real, but Buzz can't
comprehend this. The vocal chemistry between Hanks and Allen is excellent, as
Hanks sometimes yells hilarious dialogue, Allen is able to counter with a
deadly serious attitude.</P>
<P>The rivalry between the toys eventually results in the two of them getting
lost a few times while fighting over who gets to play with Andy. They go from
Andy's room, to the car, to a gas station, to an amusement park, and then to
the evil-kid-next-door's house.</P>
<P>There's always that one twisted kid everyone stays away from, and Sid
(voiced by von Detten) is the epitome of that character. His voice makes for
the perfect bully as it is clear and high-pitched, but with just the right
emphasis to make him menacing. I've never seen such a realistic evil kid in a
film before.</P>
<P>What disappointed me was the way the toys ultimately escape Sid's house.
It's fun to watch, but it essentially contradicts the premise of the film.</P>
<P>Still, "Toy Story" is original and fun, not only in its animation, but its
storytelling. Just watching the toys go through their motions if quite
fascinating, and it really makes us stop and wonder - are we playing with the
toys or are the toys playing with us? </P>
