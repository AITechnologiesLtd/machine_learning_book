<P>        It's maddening to one's sense of fairness to read back cover 
promotion like this: A FAREWELL TO ARMS is "the best American novel to 
emerge out of World War I...an unforgettable story of an American 
ambulance driver on the Italian front and his love for a beautiful English 
nurse. Hemingway's frank portrayal of the love between Lt. Henry and 
Catherine Barkley, caught in the inexorable sweep of war, glows with an 
intensity unrivaled in modern literature...his description of the German 
attack on Caporetto bears comparison to Stendhal's depiction of the 
retreat from Waterloo. Richer in language, more subtle in expression, and 
emotionally astute, (the novel) also symbolizes Hemingway's farewell to an 
attitude, a time, and a literary method. Published when Hemingway was just 
thirty, it confirmed his stature as the greatest single influence on the 
American short story and novel." After that, what's left but the Nobel 
prize? If the cult around Hemingway is culturally ingrained, it's also a 
bit much. Undeniably he has a gift for the laconic -- his shorthand prose 
and dialogue achieve his stories' limited purposes better than just about 
any other stylist. For example, when at her end Catherine says, "It's just 
a dirty trick," you'll be tempted to pooh-pooh the fatalism and jeer at 
the melodramatic setup, but at the same time you'll find yourself 
applauding Papa's 1929 audacity. (It's the kind of "paying for your sins 
of happiness" one could expect Carol Burnett's skit writers to make into 
classic camp.) And irrefutable is that his viral technique of punchy 
economy has infected generations of writers who follow him -- there's an 
endless contagion of wanna-be boxers. Your immune system warns of them in 
just about every kind of entertainment writing -- high classers, pulp 
fiction, pop trash, science fiction, horror stuff. You hear them in 
movies, on TV dramas and sitcoms and soaps, on talk-radio. Even news has 
become bastardized Hemingway: the day's stories are compacted into pugil 
stick tutorials and pithy reproaches. (Theatre more or less escaped, only 
to become technoholic.) Hemingway's brooding impatience, arrogance and 
intense lack of subtly represent who we think we are; even if some of us 
aren't as appreciative of his art as others hold we should be -- Camille 
Paglia thinks it's scandalous that some resist worshipping him as "the 
inventor of the lingua franca of American journalism" -- what he gives us 
as imagery of himself is so powerful that, like we do with Mailer, we 
absorb the bravura myth disproportionate to what's real. They may be 
monsters, but they're our monsters as literary royalty. What Hemingway 
doesn't produce as writer is in-depth character and expository detail: 
unlike Mailer, he doesn't have the tolerance to do much other than 
broadstroking, he can't be bothered with biography or, in FAREWELL, with 
much history. The book, which took thirteen months to write and resulted 
in Italy designating the author persona non grata during the 30s, is a 
blend of some of his nonfiction pieces and a whole lot of personal and 
travel experiences that eclipse the catastrophe of the war; it's simply 
bogus praise that he can be compared to Stendhal (or John Reed, the real 
architect of American-style news reporting) when what he's really doing is 
editorially dramatizing a travelogue. The more you get into Hemingway, the 
harder it is to adapt him to the screen, which is the weirdest of ironies 
because you'd think that the way he writes -- his chatter is film noir 
before it was ever coined -- would be a breeze to reenact. But it's Aldous 
Huxley who found the cloak of insufficiency inherent in the argot: "What 
Hemingway had to say was in the white spaces between the lines." Ben 
Hecht, who gets the screenplay credit for the `57 A FAREWELL TO ARMS 
screamed at producer David O. Selznick, "That sonofabitch writes in 
water!" In his "An Open Book," John Huston writes that "Hemingway's 
stories don't dramatize readily. Scenes seem to a beginning, a middle and 
an end when in fact they don't." Charles Vidor directed the picture, but 
Huston was first choice; after receiving a sixteen page single-spaced 
typewritten memo from Selznick -- a condensed version of the drivel is 
published in "Memo from David O. Selznick" -- he wisely opted out. He also 
exposes what you tend to feel while watching the movie: Selznick's "love 
for Jennifer Jones was very real and touching but in it lay the seeds of 
the failures that marked the last years of his life. Everything he did was 
for Jennifer. His life centered upon her, to the detriment of his good 
judgment. He never did anything worth a damn after he married her." The 
movie's been turned into one of those Wednesday matinee hard ticket 
weepies -- with Jones suffering for the martini'd blue hairs in the 
audience. Already seventeen years older than her character Catherine, a 
VAD more Scot than English, Jones is more than a little embarrassing to 
watch; deluded by Selznick's and the production's inflation, she thinks 
she can do the "I've-slapped-you-now-you-pump-me" routine. But there's one 
facet about which we come to believe: that not only is Catherine in her 
own words "a little gone off," so is Jones. In what performance isn't she 
titling towards Bonkersville? (Could anyone call her certifiably sane in 
SONG OF BERNADETTE, DUEL IN THE SUN, LOVE IS A MANY SPLENDORED THING, THE 
MAN IN THE GRAY FLANNEL SUIT?) Despite her "condition," which includes a 
fear of rain, she can't say no to Rock. But who'd fault her weakness? In 
his dark and shiny nonregulation-cut hair, Hudson's not too bad; king of 
the amiable glamour boys who knew that the way to movie star success was 
regularly stopping by Villa Hag, he's the epitome of 50s heartthrob. 
Unmistakably an American strapper, with a super-rare drop-dead 
friendliness, flashing a "take me, I'm yours" smile, he's nothing if not a 
CinemaScope glossy. He's not Hemingway as Hemingway writes about himself 
in the novel, but he's quite possibly what Hemingway might have hoped for 
himself at his most physically ideal. During the 50s and early 60s, who 
didn't want to be Rock or be Rocked? (What a John Waters moment it must 
have been when the studios discovered that Hudson was getting more fan 
male than fan mail.) Vittorio De Sica and the other Italian actors often 
sound looped and Mario Nascimbene's score gets a little too funereal with 
the organ. Oswald Morris did some photography but was eventually fired by 
Selznick. I'd love to know if he did the opening tourist panoramas; they'd 
make great additions to MS Scenes.  </P>
