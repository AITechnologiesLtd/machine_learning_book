<PRE>Erin Brockovich 
A film review by Marty Mapes 
Copyright 2000 Marty Mapes </PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4) "Whatever it takes to make someone a movie star, she's
got it."</P>
<P>That's what my friend says about Julia Roberts, and she's exactly right.
Roberts brings warmth and enthusiasm to ERIN BROCKOVICH, making it a
much better movie than it might have been.</P>
<PRE>THE COMMON TOUCH</PRE>
<P>ERIN   BROCKOVICH takes a new approach to the lawsuit movie. You might
say it's   like THE INSIDER without the serious tension, like A CIVIL
ACTION   without the laborious melodrama. What it has instead is the
human touch that   Roberts brings to it.  </P>
<P>Erin Brockovich (Roberts) is unemployed and underskilled. She's a single
mother raising three kids, and she'll take any kind of work she can get.
Unfortunately, nobody will hire her.</P>
<P>Her Toyota gets sideswiped by a Jaguar, and her lawyer Ed Masry (Albert
Finney) nearly wins her a big settlement. But Erin does so badly on the
stand -- wearing too-revealing clothes and suggestive makeup, then
shouting at the defendant -- that she loses the case. Desperate and
angry, she insists on a job from Masry, whom she blames for losing her
case.</P>
<P>Roberts reuses her low-class, unpretentious persona from PRETTY WOMAN.
Erin's gaudy and revealing outfits garner disapproving looks from the
other women in the office, but she takes it all in stride. Being a poor,
single mother of three has taught her how to ignore the bullies and
respect the true friends.</P>
<PRE>UNCOVERING THE COVER-UP</PRE>
<P>Erin notices something in one of Masry's real estate cases that strikes
her as odd. Medical records have gone back and forth between the buyer
and seller of a piece of property. Instead of doing her job filing, she
follows her curiosity. She gets Masry's vague, off-hand permission to do
some investigative work, and she heads to the small town where the
property is being sold.</P>
<P>After a few days' work making friends in the town, Erin realizes that
something big is happening. Pacific Gas & Electric, a major California
utility has been dumping industrial toxic chemicals into the water, and
now they're buying up every property in town to cover up what they've
done. </P>
<P>Back at the office, Masry has fired Erin. He can't remember giving her
permission to investigate, and even if he had, he never would have let
her spend three days on it. But Erin shows him the evidence she's
gathered and convinces him to take the case. Erin's got such a winning
way with people that she rallies the whole town to their common cause.</P>
<PRE>SCREEN PRESENCE </PRE>
<P>Albert Finney does a great job as Erin's boss and friend Ed Masry. His
character could have been a two-dimensional foil for Erin, but Finney
knows when to play up to Roberts and when to stand back and watch. He
knows this is Roberts' movie and doesn't try to fight it.</P>
<P>Julia Roberts singlehandedly makes this movie work. She has a great
screen presence, and she brings emotion, sympathy, and strength to the
role. One moment she's telling her boss how to run his business, the
next moment she's reacting emotionally to a phone call about her
youngest daughter's latest accomplishment. (I mention the latter because
many directors say that phone call scenes don't work on screen, but
Roberts proves them wrong.)</P>
<P>Some of Roberts' "presence" comes from her cleavage. Some of the
costumes are almost insulting, and even the audience was giggling at her
appearance. But before long, Erin acknowledges that she dresses that
way, sometimes on purpose. Because it was worked into the character (and
even the plot), it wasn't nearly as gratuitous or insulting as it first
appeared.</P>
<P>The production design and art direction (by PhilipMessina and Christa
Munro) were surprisingly good. When you see a movie with Julia Roberts
you expect money, polish, and refinement. But ERIN BROCKOVICH calls for
an ambulance-chasing lawyer, a poor title character, and a small town
too powerless to fight a utility company. Masry's office looks like it
was built in 1964, complete with dark wood paneling. Erin drives a dusty
orange 15-year old car, and the poisoned town is just redneck enough to
be convincing.</P>
<P>There is a subplot involving George (Aaron Eckhart), Erin's biker
neighbor. A minor romance develops between them. It's not much, and it's
not relevant to the main story, but it is sweet. The movie probably
spends a little too much time on their love and conflict, but at the end
screenwriter Susannah Grant ties it nicely to the main story.</P>
<P>If you're looking for the quirky Soderberg touch, you can find it,
although it's not as noticeable as in THE LIMEY or OUT OF SIGHT. There
are appropriate shots from a low angle, or with handheld camera. The
steady pace of information streaming in reads like a good crime drama.
Also, the music has some character, some flavor, without being too
obtrusive. </P>
<P>But really, ERIN BROCKOVICH is a mainstream Hollywood movie. The plot
and the dialogue often seem formulaic, even though it is based on a true
story. It may have a serious subject, but it is more entertaining than
thought provoking.</P>
<P>So it is to Julia Roberts' credit that she makes this formula,
mainstream movie into something worth going to the theater for.</P>
