Review by Larry McGillicuddy
Copyright Larry McGillicuddy</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4)
Directed by Oliver Stone
<BR>Starring Sean Penn, Jennifer Lopez, Nick Nolte, Billy Bob
Thornton, Joaquin Phoeniz, Claire Danes, Jon Voight,</P>
<P>Oliver Stone is one of my favorite filmmakers. His past
films - Salvador, Platoon, Born on the 4th of July, Natural
Born Killers, and JFK - have been among the best of the last
12 years. They've all made some sort of political or
thematic statement and usually caused controversy. This time
out, Stone seems intent on just making a cool modern noir
thriller. Unfortunately, the same things that have made his
past films great work against him here.</P>
<P>Sean Penn stars as Bobby Cooper, a drifter whose car breaks
down in the small desert town of Superior, Arizona. He meets
several offbeat characters, who thwart his attempts to
escape from Superior. He catches the eye of the mysterious
vixen Jennifer Lopez, but unbeknownst she has a husband with
 more than a few screws loose. He also runs into a flirty
teenager played by Claire Danes, whose boyfriend goes insane
whenever she's around another guy.</P>
<P>This story is sort of like a demented acid trip cross
between Doc Hollywood and Red Rock West. The problem is, I
think Stone's material isn't strong enough this time around,
and his directorial style, while visually stunning, fails to
create a true sense of suspense or fear. The first hour is
impressive enough, introducing us to the many offbeat
characters, the most memorable being Claire Danes and a
strange mechanic played by Billy Bob Thornton. The movie
falls apart in the last 30 minutes, when it goes way
overboard with one moronic twist after another, none of
which make much sense in retrospect.</P>
<P>U-Turn features brilliant performances by nearly everyone in
the cast and there are several exciting sequences.
Unfortunately, it fails to come together in the conclusion,
which just piles one twist on top of another. So after
making meaningful and controversial films the past 2
decades, Oliver Stone just wanted to make an entertaining
offbeat thriller. He was almost successful.</P>
