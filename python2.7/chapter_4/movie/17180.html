VARSITY BLUES (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Ted Prigge</PRE>

Caan, Richard Lineback, Ali Larter, Amy Smart, Eliel Swinton, Thomas F. 
Duffy, Jll Parker Jones, Joe Pichler, Tonie Perensky</P>
<P>The plot, structure, and even many of the jokes of "Varsity Blues" hail 
all the way back to 80s teen movies and sports movies spanning the 
entire length of cinematic history: it's part team tries to win despite 
adversity, part teenagers trying to overcome pressure from adult 
would-be role models. I've seen this way too many times before, as you 
probably have as well if you grew up in the heyday of the 80s, viewing 
films by John Hughes on a bi-weekly basis and intaking sports molds like 
"Major League," like I did, a time I know I at least have numerous 
regrets about. But every now and then, I almost get suckered into liking 
a formulaic film like this, for whatever reason that is. "Varsity 
Blues," in particular, has a freshness I can't quite figure out. It's 
not exactly about either being a downtrodden teen or a sports team 
trying to succeed, and because it's not really much of anything may be 
what's so nice about it. There's not a ton of bad jokes, the more 
sentimental moments (the oft-joked-about "I don't want your life" scene) 
don't feel absolutely wretched, and the lead role is played by an actor 
who, while probably never capable of an Ian McKellen-like performance 
(just to name one superb thespian), is really likable, if not really 
quite good. Hell, even the cinematography is nice, accenting the blues 
of the football jerseys nicely.</P>
<P>And instead of being completely off-put with this film, as I was with a 
couple teen-targeted flicks of late ("Can't Hardly Wait" and "Disturbing 
Behavior," just to name two that made my worst-of-98 list), I was 
instead mildly pleased. The story, about a southern town that is 
devoutly married to high-school football, is yes, a little lame (it's 
blatantly borrowed from an undertone in "The Last Picture Show"), and 
even occasionally mishandled to ridiculous proportions (I just can't 
believe they actually had football coach Jon Voigt hold his hand up in a 
Hitler-esque heil, not once, but thrice). And the story of John Moxon, 
the film's protagonist, and his battle with not wanting to play football 
past high school though showing an extraordinary talent for it at the 
time (and becoming the star quarterback when the original quarterback 
suffers an injury), is at the very least tiresome and unfelt, but it's 
only so in theory, as is the rest of this film's entities. This film 
really should be a crap film that makes a minute impact on the box 
office then goes off to Comedy Central Mid-day Hell, but it has so many 
slightly positive aspects to it that I just couldn't help but be 
enjoying myself for at least some of it.</P>
<P>For just one example, the resident fat-guy subplot, usually the weak 
link of a film like this, is handled with a surprising amount of 
compassion. The said character (played by Ron Lester) is occasionally 
the subject of lame weight ridicule, but is later actually developed as 
a character, and in a scene late in the film where he sits in a 
depressed state with hard liquor and a shotgun actually has some feeling 
behind it. Even the lead character has development: instead of resorting 
to the stardom gimmick that this film almost goes for, it allows him to 
deal with these emotions himself, and when his current girlfriend nearly 
gives up on him, he wrestles with turning to the cliche and sleeping 
with the girlfriend of a friend/ex-quarterback who has been making 
none-too-subtle advances towards him. It's not Shakespeare, or even Neil 
Simon, but it shows that maybe there will be a teenage film that 
actually delves into the emotions of its characters in an intelligent 
fashion someday.</P>
<P>Even James Van Der Beek's performance shows something of a future 
promise. Currently the star of the heavily-discussed "Dawson' Creek," he 
puts not only some depth into his character, but perhaps more 
importantly for this kind of movie, a lot of charisma. He's good at 
making otherwise cheap emotions into genuine ones, and he's completely 
at-ease in front of a camera, and he defines his character so well that 
he nearly makes the film work just by being completely sympathetic. 
There are many a thing to like about this film to those who are willing 
to abandon any dramatic credibility at the door, but then again, this 
isn't THAT good. For all that I liked about it, there's still the many 
things I didn't like about it. Voigt, for one, though good, is saddled 
with a character that the film isn't sure what to do with. I guess he's 
a villain, but if so, what gives with the start-and-stop attempts to 
deepen his character (a saddened scene where he's looking over trophies, 
symbolizing his past successes and his frustration with the present) 
when the proverbial rug will be pulled from underneath anyway? Same goes 
with his father, who is at once shown as a hard-ruling father, ordering 
his son to do his will, then other times as a poor old guy who can't get 
any respect, not from his friends or his son (who ends up pegging him in 
the nose with a football, a scene of such conflicting emotions that the 
film isn't prepared to deal with it).</P>
<P>Just add to the pot the extreme fake-ness of several of the situations, 
the use of half-assed small-town and high school football satire, and a 
couple other major detractors, and this film does not exactly get a 
sure-fire recommendation for your's truly. It's more of a mixed bag of a 
film, with parts I did like and parts I didn't like, but nothing I was 
totally enthused about. But, as I said, it does have promise for future 
movies, especially with the success of the film at the boxoffice, which 
has been nothing short of stunning (especially for a film boasting a 
member of the "Dawson's Creek" gang, a show I admit to watching a couple 
time and admit to actually enjoying). Maybe it's the R-rating that helps 
this film: it's more loose-necked, less-fake, and occasionally funnier 
(a subplot involving a stripping teacher is not exactly good, but it's 
amusing). I'd like to see a teen film that managed to take what was good 
about this film and then expanded on it. Imagine a teen film you weren't 
ashamed to say that you at least sorta liked, but actually liked. And 
maybe it should star Van Der Beek. Yeah, sounds like a good idea.</P>
