Dustin Putman's Film Reviews</A> ></P>
<P>Woody Allen, one of the most celebrated and acclaimed modern-day 
directors, has, in recent years, experimented with different types of 
films, straying from his regular New York comedy-dramas. 1994's "Bullets 
Over Broadway," was a period piece set in the 1940's; 1995's "Mighty 
Aphrodite," was a modern day Greek interpretation; 1996's "Everyone Says 
I Love You," was a magical return to the musical genre; and 1997's 
"Deconstructing Harry," was a deliberately graphic and offensive comedy. </P>
<P>Woody Allen's new film, "Celebrity," is perhaps his strongest picture 
since 1992's "Husbands and Wives," a winning and often hilarious comedy 
that delves into the lives of the rich, the famous, and the struggling.
The film follows its main character, Lee Simon (Kenneth Branagh), a 
journalist, around throughout one year, as he has interesting run-ins 
with some of Hollywood's most powerful celebrities, all the while 
searching for true love. He recently has gotten a divorce from his wife 
of sixteen years, Robin (Judy Davis), who was devastated to find out he 
had been having an affair. Many of the people he encounters include a 
blonde bombshell actress (Melanie Griffith), who gives him a tour of her 
small childhood home; a supermodel (Charlize Theron), who is 
multi-orgasmic and gets off on simply being touched anywhere on her 
body; a popular teen hunk (Leonardo DiCaprio), who trashes a hotel room 
and beats his girlfriend (Gretchen Mol), all the while telling her that 
he loves her; and a kind live-in lover (Famke Janssen). While all of 
these people come and go through Lee's life, the woman he seems most 
right for is Nola (Winona Ryder), a waitress and struggling actress, 
despite their age difference. Meanwhile, the unhappy Robin, to her 
astonishment, meets a man (Joe Mantegna) in the talk show arena whom 
falls in love with her and gives her her first big break in showbiz, a 
profession she had never expected to go into. </P>
<P>One of the problems that last year's "Deconstructing Harry," ran into 
was that it had such a large cast that everyone ultimately felt 
criminally wasted. I was fearing the same fate for, "Celebrity," but all 
of the characters are infinitely more well-handled, and the story and 
screenplay feel far more assured and satisfying. </P>
<P>One of the qualities of, "Celebrity," which is very appropriate, is the 
dream-like black & white cinematography that constantly reminded me of 
films from the 1930's and 40's. The way that the story drifts from one 
character vignette to the next was entertaining to watch because I was 
enthralled by every single one of the characters, and couldn't wait to 
see who Lee would meet next.</P>
<P>As in all of Allen's films, he has recruited a wonderful, large cast. 
Kenneth Branagh, obviously doing an Allen impersonation, is convincing 
as the central character, and Judy Davis gives a touching performance as 
Robin, a woman who has been so unhappy for so long that she can't really 
believe the happiness she feels when she meets Mantegna. Charlize Theron 
is, to say the least, bewitching as an uninhibited supermodel; Bebe 
Neuwirth, as a hooker, has a hilarious scene with Davis where she 
teaches her how to have oral sex with a banana; and Leonardo DiCaprio is 
annoying, but plays the rebellious, out-of-control teen superstar to a 
T. Finally, and perhaps giving the best performance is Winona Ryder, who 
brings so much life and spark to her scenes that I feared the film might 
burn up in the projector. One particular sequence set at a party where 
Branagh and Ryder are trying to talk amidst the various conversations 
around them is fabulously developed and shot.</P>
<P>Although set amidst the glitz and glamour of Hollywood, what, 
"Celebrity," is really about is the things that people desperately long 
for in order to be happy. Lee only wants to find love, but has several 
character flaws that he needs to get over first, and Robin is so used to 
not being appreciated that when she finally feels wanted, she doesn't 
know how to react to it. The final sequence of the film, in which Lee 
and Robin meet up at a film premiere and are able to talk rationally for 
the first time since their divorce, is especially powerful, and the last 
shot, which circles around to the opening shot, is an alternately clever 
and thought-provoking image that I think says quite a lot.</P>
