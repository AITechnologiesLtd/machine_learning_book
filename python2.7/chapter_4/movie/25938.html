<PRE>HIGHLANDER: ENDGAME
A film review by James Brundage

<P>He is Duncan MacLeod of the clan MacLeod.  He's been pimpin' it since he
was born in the village of Glennfillan in 15somethingsomething, and he
continues to pimp it in modern day.  He is immortal and he cannot die.</P>
<PRE>Much to our chagrin.</PRE>
<P>Well, I am typing this review up at about 4:20 in the morning, after
having endured the director's cuts of each previous Highlander, watched
a few more episodes of the series, and successfully ransacked my living
space to find my keys.  And, having done all of this, I offer to you
this critic's opinion of Highlander: Endgame.</P>
<P>There was a joke on Mad About You a while back that referred to what the
title of Die Hard 4 would be… Die Already.  Going into Highlander:
Endgame, anyone who has endured the three prior films and is still left
standing comes in with the same kind of attitude.  Have the gathering
already and be done with it… just don't have us hear either Duncan or
Connor MacLeod introduce themselves one more time… we're sick of hearing
it.</P>
<P>This time around, we get a spin off of both the series and the franchise
itself… which means we get to meet Connor, Duncan, Duncan's immortal
wife, that 5,000 year old Egyptian not played by Sean Connery (who was
great in the original Highlander) who sometimes guest stars on the show,
the watchers… just about everyone is here, and more heads are being lost
than in France circa 1780.</P>
<P>Viewed as a stand-alone film, Highlander: Endgame posses all of the
elements of a straight-to-video action movie.  Cheap special effects
that look cool, weak characters that still pull heartstrings, and a
bunch of actors no one really knows unless you have seen this or that
obscure flick.  And, taking that view, one wonders why the hell I even
had to watch Highlander: Endgame in theatres.</P>
<P>Regardless, due to the fact that I have some responsibility to inform
you and thus empower you to make the decision to not waste $8 to see
Endgame, I should tell you about the plot.  The watchers, who basically
work part-time to keep count of the battle between immortals (I suppose
it pays better than, say, the Army Reserve) run a place called The
Sanctuary, which a psychotic immortal (there's one in every Highlander)
called Kell (Bruce Payne) and his band of immortal cronies raid and
destroy… despite the fact that it is on Holy Ground and killing
immortals on Holy Ground is one of those Highlander no-nos.  Once again,
it is up to the Highlander(s) to stop the psycho, and this brings in a
kitschy Sean Connery/Christopher Lambert like relationship between
Connor (Lambert) and Duncan (Adrian Paul) and an even more kitschy
relationship between Faith (one of those aforementioned no-names) and
Duncan, who were once married until Duncan stabbed her in the stomach to
make sure they could be together forever. (Wasn't that the defense of
some murderer a ways back?)</P>
<P>The action sequences are decent, but the effects end up so god-awful
towards the end (such as a terrible face-morph from Duncan's face to
Connor's and back again) that all you can do is cringe.  In fact, the
only good thing you can get out of Highlander: Endgame is watching
obscure Kung Fu actor Donnie Yen kick some ass, and that only lasts
about 30 seconds.</P>
<P>What is really pitiful is that, when all is said and done, Highlander:
Endgame isn't really the end.  There are still more heads to chop off,
and at least two immortals remain on the face of the planet.  Which does
explain (and I say this was about as much rancor as a man anticipating a
root canal) why one of the four former titles -- Highlander: World
Without End -- was changed.</P>
