<P>
 Mission: Impossible 2 (2000) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Tom Cruise,
Thandie Newton, Dougray Scott, Ving Rhames and Anthony Hopkins. Story by
Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga. Screenplay by Robert Towne. Directed
by John Woo.</P>
<P> "Mission: Impossible 2" is really two movies in one.</P>
<P> The first is an action-packed thriller complete with outlandish
students, flying bullets and Hong Kong-style martial arts encounters.</P>
<P> The second is a love story borrowed from Alfred Hitchcock's
"Notorious," in which the hero's lover is asked literally to sleep with
the enemy.</P>
<P> Somehow legendary screenwriter Robert Towne ("Chinatown") - adapting a
story written by Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga - and director John
Woo ("Face/Off") are able to merge these two in a seamless outing that
will leave audiences gasping.</P>
<P> "Mission: Impossible 2" is a critic-proof movie. No matter how many
flaws, shortcomings or nitpicks I can point out, people are going to
ignore them and flock to this film.</P>
<P> And, honestly, there is no reason why they shouldn't.</P>
<P> "M:I2" is everything you want a summer movie to be: visually arresting,
an easy-to-follow plot, tons of pyrotechnics and two gorgeous stars.</P>
<P> One is Tom Cruise, reprising his role as Ethan Hunt. The other is
Thandie Newton, one of the most beautiful actresses to grace the screen
today.</P>
<P> Their scenes together smolder with sexual chemistry.</P>
<P> The film's plot centers around a deadly virus supposedly held by a
renegade IMF agent named Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott). Hunt's mission,
which he accepts, of course, is to retrieve the virus as well as its
cure.</P>
<P> To do this he is told to recruit Nyah Hall (Newton), Ambrose's former
love interest. Nyah also happens to be a professional thief.</P>
<P> The attraction between Nyah and Hunt is instantaneous as they first
meet in Seville, Spain, with the throbbing beat of flamenco music heard
in the background.</P>
<P> As is his custom, Woo uses many slow-motion shots and close-ups. He is
especially fond of extreme close-ups of Newton, who is very easy to look
at.</P>
<P> Cruise looks buff and sculpted. His babyish face is beginning to take
on some character giving him a semi-rugged countenance that suits him.</P>
<P> Scott, who played Prince Henry in "Ever After," does not seem that
formidable a foe. He appears a bit too soft, too vulnerable to be an
out-and-out, over-the-top villain.</P>
<P> Also in the cast is Ving Rhames again playing computer genius Luther
Stickell, and Anthony Hopkins in a cameo as Hunt's boss.</P>
<P> "M:I2" is a visual treat. Set pieces include a car chase involving Nyah
and Ethan as well as a hair-raising motorcycle duel between Hunt and
Ambrose. "M:I2" is stylish, stunning and loud.</P>
<P> The musical score by Hans Zimmer alternates from a pounding action
motif to a romantic flamenco love theme for the scenes between Ethan and
Nyah.</P>
<P> The movie's main drawback is that it's not really "Mission: Impossible"
as created by Bruce Geller. The TV series emphasized brain over brawn.
The IMF team would play mind games, use masks, illusions, create train
rides, earthquakes, all to confuse and bedevil their target into
surrendering that week's McGuffin.</P>
<P> "M:I2" plays more like a James Bond outing. True, both Hunt and Ambrose
use masks to disguise themselves to learn information, but that is
basically the only tip of the hat to the TV series.</P>
<P> Too many gunbattles and too many hand-to-hand encounters gives "M:I2"
the feel of encroaching into 007 territory.</P>
<P> However, that aside, "Mission: Impossible 2" is an extremely
entertaining vehicle, a testosterone-filled escape. It's a slam-bang way
to begin the summer.</P>
