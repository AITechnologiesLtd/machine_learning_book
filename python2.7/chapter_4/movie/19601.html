<P>After sixteen years Francis Ford Copolla has again returned to his favorite
project, making the third installment in the Godfather-trilogy. This new
film has been underrated for no reason. It is as intellectual and
majestically made as Copolla's pervious films. It is also more
psychological, pessimistic and more tragic than the first two. The only
regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer Sofia Copolla and
some "unfinished" developments of some characters.</P>
<P>The film elegantly begins with Nino Rota's recognizable musical score, the
beautiful skyscrapers of New York and Michael's voice as he is writing a
letter to his children: "The only wealth in this world is children. More
than all money and power on earth, you are my treasure" . The year is 1979
and Michael Corleone has used the time since the ending of "Part II" to make
his father's dream come true - making the Corleone family legitimate.
Michael sold all his casinos and invests only in gambling. Constantly
haunted by the past, his only reason to live is his children.</P>
<P>The family has amassed unimaginable wealth, and as the film opens Michael
Corleone (Al Pacino) is being invested with a great honor by the church.
Later that day, at a reception, his daughter announces a Corleone family
gift to the church and the charities of Sicily, "a check in the amount of
$100 million." But the Corleones are about to find, as others have
throughout history, that you cannot buy forgiveness. Sure, you can do
business with evil men inside the church, for all men are fallible and
capable of sin. But God does not take payoffs.</P>
<P>The plot of the movie, concocted by Coppola and Mario Puzo in a screenplay
inspired by headlines, brings the Corleone family into the inner circles of
corruption in the Vatican. There is a moment in "Godfather III" where
Michael says: "All my life I have been trying to go up in society, where
everything was legal. But the higher I go, the crookier it becomes.." .</P>
<P>Visually this film is as spectacular as the first two. Gordon Willis' rich
cinematography, Carmine Copolla's beautiful composition and Alex Tavoularis'
wonderful art direction could not be better. But Copolla's first two
Godfather-films were more famous for their deep, intellectual plots, tree
dimensional characters and incredible acting, than for their visual
perfection. The third installment has only the plot and visuals. Some
characters could be much more developed and the acting, although good, never
accomplishes to reach the same height of the first two films. The biggest
miscasting is Sofia Copolla , who is so unconvincing and unemotional that
she manages to ruin several scenes throughout the movie, that could have
been grander and more emotional. The best performance comes unsurprisingly
from Al Pacino, who should have got a nomination for best actor at the
Oscars. Andy Garcia  is powerful as Sonny's son, strong, focused and loyal.
Violence is natural to him. He suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes
revenge on his family's behalf, and in this he is supposed to be strong in
the uncomplicated way Don Vito Corleone was. However both Kay (Diane Keaton)
and Connie (Talia Shire) are useless. And characters like Vito Corleone and
Tom Hagen are really missed. The good part is that Michael is again reunited
with old friends, that you remember from the first and second films.</P>
<P>In the third film Michael has become almost like his father, Vito in the
first film and Vincenzo resembles Michael when he was much younger. This
parallel could be more interesting if Vincenzo's character was more
developed.</P>
<P>Many have pointed out that making the third film, was unnecessary. I
disagree. It is a beautiful film of great importance, completing the tragic
saga of the Corleone family.</P>
<P>The first film showed some horrible results of Corleone's life. It showed
Michael making a choice; the second showed a man damning himself for his
choices and feeling the impact of changing times. A man desperately trying
to keep his balance, focus, family and sanity, while everything is crashing
all around him. The third film is a terrifying conclusion - a result of
Michael's life. The life he chose for himself is like quicksand - one wrong
step and you are doomed. There is no turning back. And no matter how hard
you try to get out of it, to free yourself, no matter how powerful and
wealthy you are, you are helpless - sinking deeper and deeper till it
swallows you completely. The beautifully directed last sequence is also the
powerful climax of the film, when Michael is sitting alone in his chair,
left by everyone, surrounded by emptiness and memories of his friends and
family members long dead. Here he dies - alone, miserable and unforgiven</P>
