<P>"Clueless" Emma is Back With A Motley Cast of Fallible Characters One
Cannot Help But Like</P>
<P>In EMMA, yet another romantic comedy based on Jane Austen's satiric
novel, we are transported back to nineteenth-century provincial England.
however, we are never once allowed to delude ourselves into thinking
that we escape Austen's parodic pen, for self-delusion, gossip and
social inadaptablity continue to be relevant to our modern-day
sensibilities. No wonder Jane Austen is "Hollywood's Hottest Writer."</P>
<P>Austen's opening lines of her novel of the same name, </P>
<PRE>        Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich with a comfortable home and         
        happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of         
        existence ...</PRE>
<P>could well be a description of actres Gwyneth Paltrow, who portrays the
delinquent Emma in the film, and this gives the role an added subtext.
Hailed as one of the most beguiling and talented actresses of her
generation, and continuing to lead a charmed life with Brad Pitt, she
fits perfectly into the role of the self-satisfied and presumptuous
Emma. As she weaves her match-making web and speaks her wry epigrams,
the smile she brandishes is often a shade too pleased with itself,
capturing the essence of a character whose comic flaws are self-delusion
and a desire to play God. Paltrow's combination of golden beauty, grace
and intelligence makes her quite literally shine in this role.
Unfortunately, delightful as her performance may be, her limited range
of expressions is unlikely to garner her any Oscars.</P>
<P>The object of Emma's blundering excursions is Harriet Smith, played by
Toni Collette, who played the lead role in MURIEL'S WEDDING. Collette
scarely looks the part of a naive seventeen-year-old, but her portrayal
convincingly captures Harriet's insecurity, self-doubt and desire for
approval. So influenced is she by Emma's opinions of her grandeur, her
marital sights rise from local farmer Robert Martin, a genteel farmer to
Mr Elton the parish priest, to Mr Knightley, an established member of
the gentry. The unweaving of Harriet's matrimonial web brings scene
after scene of humourous insight into human nature, and of the
difficulty of finding one's perfect match.</P>
<P>Emma herself is caught between the charming Frank Churchill (Ewan
McGregor) and Mr Knightley (Jeremy Northam), who is her special friend,
confidaante, and the gentleman who exudes a wisdom, understanding and
sensuality that Emma is blind to. The turning point in Emma's path to
self-discovery is perhaps the picnic scene where she mocks the endlessly
chattering but kind-hearted spinster, Miss Bates. </P>
<P>The latter is portrayed sympathetically by Sophie Thompson (sister to
the famed Emma), who almost steals the show each time she appears,
managing to variously convey insecurity and pain through her comic
monologues. She forms part of an impressive cast of supporting actors,
which also includes Alan Cumming and Juliet Stevenson, who portray the
odiously pompous Eltons with a taunting gaiety that *dares* the viewer
to dislike them. As caricatures of snobbery, they are irrepressibly
funny.</P>
<P>This lively and entertaining adaptation marks the commendable
directorial debut of America writer Douglas McGrath, who also wrote the
screenplay. However, when compared with Amy Heckerling's script for
CLUELESS, which saw a radical change to a Beverly Hills setting and the
invention of a MTV vocabulary, this adaptation of "Emma" becomes too
safe, predicatable, and audience-friendly. It is a "sunny garden party,"
where you catch occasional glimpses of yourself that amuse, but do not
disturb. Ultimately, it is satire without bite, wit without derision,
critique without affront, and adaptation without imagination.</P>
<P>The Flying Inkpot Rating System:
 * Wait for the TV2 broadcast. 
 ** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha! 
 *** Pretty good, bring a friend. 
 **** Amazing, potent stuff. 
 ***** Perfection. See it twice.<HR>This movie review was written for THE FLYING INKPOT:  an arts and
