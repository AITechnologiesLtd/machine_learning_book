<PRE>                             CITY OF INDUSTRY
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>A favorite storyline for movies is the one about a criminal who wants
to go straight . . . but only after one more heist that will fix him
financially for life. Most recently there was ABSOLUTE POWER.
Fortunately for CITY OF INDUSTRY, it is a bit more believable. It also
has a powerful performance by veteran Harvey Keitel as  "Roy," the
elder brother of "Lee," (Timothy Hutton.)  The two help elevate what
would be pretty much an ordinary story and bring it up a notch or two.</P>
<P>Lee, as criminals are rated, is small potatoes, never having struck it
big in his chosen profession.  He wants to go straight, start life
anew.  But first he needs the one big one that can set him on "Easy
Street" for life.  For this he plots a Palm Springs jewelry store
robbery as his way out of crime and into "normal" life.</P>
<P>Lee induces his brother, Roy, who has been more successful in his
criminal life and has escaped into the unknown Midwest, to go along
with Roy on this last adventure.  Against his better judgment, he
agrees.  (I have seen enough movies to know he should have just said
"No.")  In addition to the two brothers, they need a good getaway
driver and they find him in Skip Kovich (Stephen Dorff).  Anyone else
would have noticed that Skip is touchy, spontaneous and not exactly
reliable but Lee never notices that; all he knows is he is a great
driver and Roy goes along with the choice even if he is not happy with
it..  Rounding out the crew is Jorge Montana (Wade Dominguez) who is
recently out of jail and could easily be back in if he is caught
violating his probation.  Jorge has a wife and children who worry
about him . . . with good reason.</P>
<P>Hardly does the film get rolling when brother Lee is killed.  That
caught me by surprise because stars such as Hutton are not usually
disposed of so early in a film.  However, that is the motivation for
brother Roy to seek out the someone who betrayed them . . . and Roy
wants revenge.  Hence this exciting film-noir.</P>
