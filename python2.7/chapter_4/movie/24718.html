                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     There are a million stories in the naked city, and a new
documentary from Jason Rosette does a remarkable job at ferreting out
one of them -- and where you'd least expect it.</P>
<P>     BookWars examines the strange and unexpectedly intense world of
street booksellers in Manhattan -- specifically, a little stretch of 4th
Street near NYU, where otherwise unemployed types set up an 8-foot
table, covered with treasures of the printed word.</P>
<P>     Rosette tells the story from the inside, having spent three years
on 4th, selling precious volumes of Dostoyevsky, Kerouac, and
Kierkegaard.  We meet his colleagues, who range from surprisingly well
adjusted to almost completely insane.  And we discover the origins of
the books -- estate sales, libraries, the trash, and even other street
sellers when they inevitably wash out.</P>
<P>     But Rosette's tale is especially remarkable from several
perspectives.  First, the streetwise merchandising tactics you learn in
BookWars' 79 minutes teach you more about business than any MBA
program.  Second, the socio-political microscope the booksellers find
themselves under when Giuliani's "Quality of Life" program is introduced
(thus attempting to whisk them off the sidewalks) makes a powerful
statement about who programs like these are really helping out.
Corporate America and academia are the understated targets as the
independent street booksellers are gradually given less and less
"official" space in which to operate.</P>
<P>     While Rosette's over-earnest narration can get thick at times and
the finale feels a tad dismissive, his story is never short of
enthralling.  Altogether, it's a fresh break from more sanitized
documentary filmmaking, giving us a unique look into a part of life I've
always wondered about.</P>
