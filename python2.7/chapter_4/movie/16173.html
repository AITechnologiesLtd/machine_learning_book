<PRE>Saving Private Ryan</PRE>
<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>At the time I am writing this, I have seen Saving Private Ryan three times.
Each time, I have resolved myself to write a review on it, but was not able
to do so. To sum up the greatness of this film would be like writing a
letter to the mother of a dead soldier. No words I can say can express the
tragedy inherent in the film. I could batter you with cliché after cliché,
trite phrase after trite phrase, but what would that accomplish? "Best film
of the year", "finest war movie ever made", and "an incredible experience"
are truths, but they do not tell the story.
Saving Private Ryan is a film about the agony of war. It is not told, as
most war films are, from a third-person, as the eye that sees but does not
care, but as a first-person (though I cannot reveal who), showing what
happened in World War II. The one cliché I will give that actually does do
the movie justice, and hear me out, is that it is the most violent movie of
all time.</P>
<P>Why does this do Saving Private Ryan justice? Because that is war. War is
when you have a man searching for his arm on Normandy while the world goes
to hell around him. War is innocent soldiers screaming for their mothers
with their guts hanging out, their final words being unintelligible because
of the pain. War is brutal. Saving Private Ryan IS war.</P>
<P>The basic plot is this: a squad of eight men is sent to retrieve one, a boy
who has lost his three brothers on the field of battle and now is lost
himself somewhere behind enemy lines. The eight men, Army Rangers, are
war-hardened individuals, but still strikingly human. Each character, from
the victims who are shot down in the first second of the invasion of
Normandy (which a re-enactment of occupies the first half hour of the film),
to Capt. Henry Miller (Tom Hanks) to Private James Ryan himself, are
beautifully developed, and perfect illustrations of the effects of war upon
man.</P>
<P>This is the justice I offer: The first time I watched it, I saw an old man
walking out. Upon asking him why he was walking out, seeing him in the
lobby, he informed me this: he had been at Normandy.</P>
