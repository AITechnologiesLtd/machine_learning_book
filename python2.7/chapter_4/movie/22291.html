<PRE>THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE (MGM)
Directed by Tay Garnett</PRE>
<P>         Considered smutty back in the days when novels could still be
"banned in Boston," "The Postman Always Rings Twice" nevertheless became
a best-seller upon publication in 1934. It was still a hot potato over a
decade later when MGM decided to film it, and considerable laundering of
the book's language and sexual content were required before "Postman"
could withstand the scrutiny of the censors.</P>
<P> Despite the whitewash, the John Garfield/Lana Turner version is
far superior to the 1981 Jack Nicholson/Jessica Lange remake, which,
despite being more faithful to Cain, is a dreary slog with only Lange's
striking performance to recommend it. In contrast, Garfield and Turner
electrify; there's no nudity or on-screen sex in the picture, yet the
erotic charge between these two is incredibly potent. Moving at an
almost breathless pace, "Postman" sends wanderer Frank Chambers
(Garfield) into the orbit of heavenly body Cora Smith (Turner), the
dissatisfied wife of Nick (Cecil Kellaway), owner of the Twin Oaks Lunch
Room. Frank is hired as a jack-of-all-trades and almost instantly sets
about giving Cora a helping hand in her plans to turn the none-too-busy
restaurant into a major attraction. A major attraction also develops
between the two, and it isn't long before they're taking moonlit swims
together and cooking up plans to get rid of congenial lush Nick.</P>
<P> Despite a ludicrous score that underlines each plot twist with
screaming strings, "Postman" remains an amazing piece of work, certainly
the finest film ever turned out by Tay Garnett, a workman-like director
who made scores of undistinguished pictures during his 40-year career.
Garnett gives Turner one of the most memorable entrances in film
history: She's introduced as the camera pans up from her white shoes to
her magnificent legs to her clinging white outfit, crowned by a white
turban. Platinum blonde Cora's wardrobe becomes the movie's most subtle
joke -- almost everything is white, including her beret and her bathing
suit! Turner, never the most versatile of actresses, is startlingly
alive here; as a star who was celebrated more for her figure than for
her talent, perhaps she could relate to the role of a young woman who
feels her light is being hidden underneath the bushel of a confining
marriage. When Cora becomes infuriated, as in the scene in which Frank
talks about looking for bargains and Cora hisses "you won't find
anything cheap here," that fire shoots out, and Turner's eyes could burn
holes in the screen.</P>
<P> As the happy-go-lucky Frank, Garfield is equally arresting. He
understood -- as Nicholson did not -- that in order for the audience to
identify with Frank, he must come off as an everyday guy pulled by fate
into an inescapable whirlpool of lust and paranoia. James Sanford</P>
