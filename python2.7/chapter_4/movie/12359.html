<P>  In his fluffy play "California Suite," Neil Simon's tense, chain-
smoking New York magazine writer visits her laid-back
ex-husband in southern California.  He, Bill Warren, cannot
understand why his ex continues to live in the fast-paced big
city while she, Hannah Warren, is appalled by what she
considers Bill's sloth.  Their mutual incomprehension
continues long after their marriage has dissolved.  The writer
does not take sides, but rather implies that while there's no
place like home, human beings must decide for themselves
where they prefer to be.  </P>
<P>   Robert Redford, on the other hand, does take a stand in
the conflict between city mouse and country mouse.  The
celebrated actor, who surpassed Paul Newman as the
country's most popular performer during the 1970s, maintains
a home in Manhattan but spends most of his time on his vast
properties in Utah.  His inclination is with the open spaces, or
so you'll have to believe if you accept "The Horse Whisperer"
as his adulation of the American west.  "The Horse
Whisperer" is filmed primarily in Montana, where the grass
grows tall and for some is greener on the other side. For
others, less jaded, this turf is the color of the finest emerald.</P>
<P>   The movie, which stars Robert Redford (who also directed
and co-produced the story from a best-selling novel by the
English writer Nicholas Evans), deals with a woman who edits
a slick, urban magazine, is vaguely dissatisfied with her
marriage to a good man, and who finds passion and meaning
among people who live in a different world.  Annie MacLean
(Kristin Scott Thomas) lives with her lawyer husband Robert
(Sam Neill) and their 14-year-old daughter Grace (Scarlett
Johansson).  On one snowy day in their upstate New York
country home, young Grace goes for a ride with her friend on
her beloved horse Pilgrim.  A freak accident throws her friend
from her horse where she is pulled along the ground.  Grace's
attempt to rescue her pal puts both in the path of a skidding
18-wheeler, killing her friend, injuring Pilgrim severely, and
causing Grace to lose part of her right leg.  Annie must now
cope with a teenager who is plunged into depression and a
badly damaged horse which has become so traumatized that
he turns feral.  The scenario brings to mind a news event
which broke just two weeks before the opening of the
picture...

   NOLENSVILLE, Tenn. (AP May 5) -- An enraged horse
known for being unruly kicked a man to death. Sheriff's Sgt.
Robert Dillon said Tuesday that Billy Camron, believed to be
64, suffered severe injuries to his head, back and other parts
of his body and also had several bite marks. Dillon quoted
Camron's son as saying "it was just a mean
horse."  Deputies said they found the horse running "rampant
in the field" when they arrived Monday night.  The son
authorized the horse to be killed. 
                      *        *      *</P>
<P>   Pilgrim, however, had never been a mean horse and had,
in fact, tried to protect his rider from injury. Wounds inflicted
on him had turned him into a untamed beast, and Annie
rejects the advice of her vet (Cherry Jones) to "put him down"
seeking out a horse whisperer to restore his sanity.</P>
<P>   "The Horse Whisperer" encompasses two epic stories
during its ample, 164-minute span.  On one level, the picture
deals with the attempts of the title character, Tom Booker
(Robert Redford) to administer to a psychotic animal using a
technique unknown in the East and, in fact, even in his own
country.  As Booker puts it, he does not treat people with a
horse problem; he handles horses with people difficulties.  On
another plane, "The Horse Whisperer" is a romance involving
a slowly-growing relationship between a gentle rancher who
has not felt the pangs of love since he split up with his wife,
and an edgy, urban sophisticate who had not realized she
could respond in a vigorous way to a man.  The heady effect
of the plains spirit works its mysteries on young Grace as
well, who is lifted from her grand funk under the influence of
the sensitive horseman and the kindness of the extended
family of ranchers she has grown to respect.</P>
<P>   Redford seems to have chosen the subject to venerate a
way of life which is fading under the sway of the large
corporations: the spirit of the independent cowboys who
appear so remote from the attractions of the big city that they
might be living on Mars.  They are contrasted with what
passes for civilization by some clever, homespun dialogue. 
Told that a New York woman has come to spend time in
Montana, Frank Booker (Chris Cooper), Tom's brother,
suggests "Mixed salads...New York women like mixed
salads"--as he and his family dig into their robust dinner of
meat, mashed potatoes and thickly-buttered bread.  The
Bookers seem to amaze Grace and Annie momentarily when
they recite a quiet prayer just before digging into their spread,
though Frank's down-home wife Diane (Dianne Wiest), not
wholly satisfied by her life, wistfully suggests that she would
like to travel to Morocco.  Yet another jarring difference
between Montana and Manhattan emerges when Annie's cell
phone goes off, alarming the horse whom Tom is struggling to
tame.  A city dweller could scarcely imagine Tom's patience
when in one incident, as Pilgrim runs away from his corral,
the horse is captivated by the patient Tom who simply sits on
the grass and stares at the animal for hours as if to say "It's
your decision."</P>
<P>   You come away from the movie with a more visceral
understanding of why Kevin Bacon and Peter Fonda spend
most of their time on their Montana ranches and why Redford
would choose to live in Utah, spending only a fraction of his
year in New York.  Redford's is a west of Marlboro men who
don't smoke, rough-and tumble cowpokes who don't curse,
and squeaky-clean kids who say "ma'am" and "thank you"
and are genuinely involved in the chores on their ranch.  In
short it's about home, perhaps the most important word in the
English language.  In Redford's terms happiness belongs to
those who have found it.</P>
<P>   Scarlett Johansson provides us with a believable
performance of a fun-loving girl who, like her cherished
equine, turns bratty from a serious injury but who has become
wholly rehabilitated under the guidance of a considerate man.
Kristin Scott Thomas effectively bares her conflict between a
devotion to her dependable and loving husband and her
passion for a westerner who is firmly rooted to his place and
its history.  Robert Redford continues to amaze.  This sixty-
year old, impossibly handsome actor will probably continue
playing square-jawed, sky-eyed, lonely heroes well into his
eighties, and we don't wonder that after seeing the movie
"Indecent Proposal," a young man in the audience who said
to his date: "Would you sleep with him for a million dollars?"
gets the reply from the sweet young thing, "Sure: but you'll
have to give me some time to raise the money."  Rated
PG-13.  Running time: 164 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten
