<PRE>NATIONAL LAMPOON'S LOADED WEAPON 1
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov</PRE>
<P>These days, people have rather short attention span and
hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run. 1970s
nostalgia is already wearing off, and now, people are
becoming more and more interested in 1980s. Few years in the
future, early 1990s are going to be regarded as next Golden
Age of nostalgia. However, I doubt that people are going to
be very nostalgic about the Hollywood products of that
period. One of the reason would surely be films like
NATIONAL LAMPOON'S LOADED WEAPON 1, that, in many ways,
symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary American film
industry - lack of originality and ideas.</P>
<P>Being made as some kind of parody on LETHAL WEAPON series,
this film pairs two L.A. policemen - Jack Colt (Emilio
Estevez), burn-out alcoholic cop on the edge, and Wes Luger
(Samuel L. Jackson), by-the-book policeman, days away from
retirement. Two of them, following the murder of Luger's ex-
partner, must confront evil General Mortars (William
Shatner), crime lord who is going to flood the market with
cocaine stashed in Wilderness Girl cookies.</P>
<P>The authors of this films (whose director, Gene Quintano,
worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of
POLICE ACADEMY) lacked any original idea before they
undertook the projects, and that reflects in the lack plot,
characters, and, even original lines. The plot, or what goes
for the plot in this movie, is nothing more than a series of
gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous
few years (apart from LETHAL WEAPON series, this film
"borrows" its female lead from BASIC INSTINCT). The best
gags, are, same as with many other similar movies, shown in
the trailers. The rest simply doesn't work. Only those who
used to watch a lot of Hollywood products in that period
would laugh. Others would probably wince at the lameness of
humour. Some would be entertained by celebrity cameos that
pop up every once in a while. But, at the end, spending hour
and half in front of this disorganised mess of a movie is
simply not worth the effort.</P>
<PRE>P.S.</PRE>
<P>The film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of a
series that already had strong comic overtones. The authors
of LETHAL WEAPON returned the favour by using the LOADED
WEAPON 1 joke in their fourth sequel.</P>
