<P>As Reviewed by James Brundage (MovieKritic2000)</P>
<P> As a critic, I try to do justice to a film.  If the film is bad, this is
incredibly easy.  It is much easier to destroy than to create, to rip than
to extol.  As I have often mentioned, it is the good reviews that are
difficult to write.  I have a conflict between the desire to write a review
worthy of the movie as well as to write a review different than the ones
that I see every day.</P>
<P> You see, bad reviews vary endlessly.  When faced with the raw anger one
feels towards a bad movie it is easy to channel this rage into a sort of
maligned creativity and to bring forth a new, humorous, and often refreshing
movie review.  When a movie is good, however, the critic is faced with the
difficulty of coming up with something good to say about it.  Put in
layman's terms, we are often faced with writer's block.</P>
<P> At least a dozen times I have watched Mother Night.  At least a dozen times
I have been blown away by its lyricism, by its dark humor and by its raw
dramatic power.  At least a dozen times I have had absolutely no clue how to
word my praises.</P>
<P> My undying desire to be somewhat original in my critique has led me to the
conclusion that what I do so often is not a critique per se, but instead a
column.  A pondering on the nature of things where I try to offer a new and
interesting perspective on an old debate.</P>
<P> With this self-revelation, the subject of the debate brought forth by
Mother Night is why people are so threatened by touchy subjects that they
ignore perfectly great films.</P>
<P> Mother Night, the story of American spy Howard W. Campbell, Jr., a man who
has worked his way up to the top of the Nazi propaganda ministry, lost his
wife (the only thing that made his life worth living in his eyes), and now,
15 years later, is being forced to confront the question "did I do more harm
than good?" is one of those films that is perfectly inoffensive to all who
watch it yet pissed everyone who didn't see it off on principle.  It deals
highly with moral questions, coming to the point early on in the quote "be
careful what you pretend to be, because, in the end, you are what you
pretend to be."  Yet the chief complaint that I have heard about the film is
that it is too offensive, too anti-Semitic to watch.</P>
<P> On pure cinematic grounds, the film is excellent.  It has perfect story
structure, humor at the right parts, seriousness when necessary.  It has
mystery, it has tension.  It has a believable set of characters (although
the group of Nazis living in New York including the Reverend Doctor Lionel
Jones "D.D.S., D.D." are perhaps the funniest charicature of the stupidity
and hypocrisy of prejudicial behavior.).  It has a plot that is not too far
out there considering the numerous other true stories involving spies in the
propaganda ministry.</P>
<P>Nick Nolte (although this sounds the very cliché I wish to avoid) plays his
part to such steely perfection that you cannot help but identify with him
and his plight, but understand his actions.  Sheryl Lee takes a break from
her idiosyncratic routine of being the weirdo ("Twin Peaks", Twin Peaks:
Fire Walk with Me, John Carpenter's Vampires) and shines in what translates
to a very large supporting role and John Goodman does a lot better in Mother
Night than he has in any film in the past twenty years.</P>
<P> Yet something about this film annoys so many people that it was overlooked.</P>
<P> It came out in 1996, the year where The English Patient made its sweep at
the Academy Awards.  Mother Night is much better than Secrets & Lies, the
shoo-in nomination, and at least as good as The English Patient, if not
slightly better.  I realize I have spoken treason at this point in time but
am beyond caring.</P>
<P> The fact it is that Mother Night is one of a cadre of films that is swept
under the rug due to the fact that it hits some cultural hot button to the
average (slightly prejudicial) person.  These films are so great that they
deserve to be nominated if not win awards but instead become just your
general word-of-mouth only films.  In 1996, it was Mother Night, a film
which dealt candidly with Nazism and poked fun (in a satirical way) at the
ideals of that completely idiotic belief system.  In 1997, it was Chasing
Amy, which spoke openly about lesbianism, and modern sexuality and was fond
of using profanity (but no more fond than half the films by Oliver Stone or
other A-list directors.)  In 1998, Lolita and Smoke Signals were swept under
the rug.  Smoke Signals was allowed to be shown in this country and dealt
with father-son relationships and Indians without particular axes to grind.
Lolita, closely based on the novel by Vladmir Nabaknov, was one of the few
films that admits that not only are teens having sex, but that all people,
no matter what their ages, are capable of understanding the power that it
can hold over someone and capable of abusing it.  The film was not allowed
to be shown in the United States, and can only be found now on Showtime or
in your local video store.  It showed little nudity and contained no
profanity.</P>
<P> Similarly, going back to Mother Night, this film uses no profanity that our
society considers "serious", nor is it excessively violent or sexual.  With
the editing of a few frames, it would be suitable for network broadcast with
no further complications.</P>
<P> All of these films deserved Best Picture nods (come on, did we really need
to nominate The Full Monty, The Thin Red Line, or Elizabeth).  All of these
films did less than 20 million in the box office.  All of these films are
excellent.</P>
<P> The thing which all of these films share is that the general public trusted
what they heard as spoken by a few conservatives who did not give these
films a chance.  Anyone who has seen any of the aforementioned movies knows
that, although they hit on subjects that are touchy, they are careful not to
 tread on toes.  They know that Mother Night is not, as some people have
claimed, anti-Semitic, but instead anti-anti-Semitic.  They know that
Chasing Amy and Lolita are both films that, in the end, contain heavy
morals.  They know that Smoke Signals is not a political statement but not
saying anything but instead a simple story about forgiving one's father.</P>
<P> I make a call to all movie patrons.  To all people reading my message.  It
was said in Mother Night that National Socialism will exist as long as
people are thinking with their guts and not with their minds.  Although the
Nazis in the film cheer at this, this is a backhanded insult towards them
and a joke at their hypocrisy and stupidity.  This same hypocrisy is shown
when people prejudge a film based on profanity, or violence, or a political
or sexual message that they do not yet know of.  Stop following the people
telling you that this film or that film is offensive.  Stop following the
politicians that say that movies and violence on television corrupts your
mind.  The true moral in Mother Night, in addition to not pretending to be
something you're not, is that you have a mind, and that you should exercise
it instead of going on the propaganda life spoon feeds you.<HR>MovieKritic2000: Reviews for the Generation of a New Millenium
