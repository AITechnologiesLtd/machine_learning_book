<PRE>                             RAISE THE RED LANTERN
                       A film review by George V. Reilly
                        Copyright 1992 George V. Reilly</PRE>
<P>     RAISE THE RED LANTERN is a film directed by Zhang Yimou.  It stars
Gong Li and was nominated for this year's Best Foreign Film Oscar.</P>
<P>     Zhang Yimou is probably best known in the West for his previous
film, JU DOU, which also starred Gong Li as a young woman married to a
rich older man.  There the similarities end.</P>
<P>     In this film set in 1920's China, Gong Li plays Songlian, a young
woman who has been forced to leave the university after the death of her
father and who must find a husband.  She becomes the Fourth Mistress of
Master Chen.  The household is divided into several wings and each of
the Mistresses holds court in her own wing.  Each night, the Master has
the concubines stand in a common courtyard where he chooses the one with
whom he will sleep that night by placing a red lantern in front of her.
As red lanterns are raised all around her house so that mistress goes
into the ascendant.</P>
<P>     The Mistresses are engaged in a never-ending power struggle.  First
Mistress, who has a grown son, is not an active participant: she is
accorded the respect due to her seniority.  The Second Mistress, who has
only a 'worthless' daughter, is sweet and charming.  The Third Mistress,
with a son the same age as his half-sister, is catty and jealous of
Songlian.   Meishan is an ex-opera singer and the Master's former
favourite, and doesn't take kindly to the usurper.  She pretends to be
ill on Songlian's wedding night, so that the Master will come to her
bed.</P>
<P>     Gradually, though, Songlian comes to realize that her real enemy is
the Second Mistress who "has the face of a Buddha, but the heart of a
scorpion."  By now determined to win power over her "sisters", Songlian
pretends to be pregnant.  Eventually, she is found out---betrayed by her
maid upon whom she wreaks vengeance.  The stakes are raised ever higher
and tragedy ensues.</P>
<P>     RED LANTERN has been banned in China as being ideologically
incorrect, presumably because it can be viewed as an allegory about
China.  The household is bound by a unyielding set of rules and
strictures, disobeyed only by the foolhardy.  One of the Mistresses is
discovered in adultery and taken away; another happens upon a group of
the servants taking the adulteress to her death.  When she discovers the
body, she screams "Murderers!", but the Master blandly denies the
accusation, tells her that she is mad and that she saw nothing, just as
the Beijing government denies Tiannamen Square.</P>
<P>     Like JU DOU, RED LANTERN is beautiful.  In particular, Zhang Yimou
makes very effective use of sunlight.  The pace of the film is slow and
assured, like a formal dance, each step proceeding inexorably from what
has gone before.</P>
<P>     Gong Li is excellent as the Fourth Mistress, as are the actresses
who play Second and Third Mistresses.</P>
<PRE>     I recommend RAISE THE RED LANTERN highly.</PRE>
