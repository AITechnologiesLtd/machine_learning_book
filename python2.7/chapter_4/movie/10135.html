<P>The world is saved in the Mortal Kombat tournament, but sore
losers will always be sore losers. So upon loosing the Outer world
decides to invade the mortal realm and invade earth. Our hero's from
the previous movie have to defend the realm. </P>
<P>OK, the concept is simple, and I stated it above that is about
as simple as a plot can be. This plot even fails at that. I think that
this whole script was written in about 20 min. Nothing in the plot
seems to fit, all the scenes seem to lurch forward at an unsightly
gaint. A lot of the movie will be obviously be based on fighting, but
that does not mean that there can't be anything resembling a plot.
There seems to be a lot of rather random fight scenes that simply
occur out of thin air. Also as the simple fact that the forces of
darkness have ARMIES running around after the hero's and the all they
do is bump into the generals... *YAWN* Too much of this movie was
lumped together bits and pieces that would have suited other movies.
There is a fight scene where Sonya, and some female(unnamed rather
major character) have something of a mud wrestling match.. well at the
very least mud kickboxing. I'm sorry but its pretty bad when you have
to throw something like that into the movie to maintain attention.
There is no lead in into the movie what so ever, you are essentially
left off where the previous one ends. this is poor style because you
cant expect everyone to have seen the first movie.  The plot in this
movie doesn't seem to have much direction and it affects the rest of
the movie because of that.  </P>
<P>This movie is essentially a breeding ground for special
effects, well at least it has the potential to be that. This movie had
special effects, albeit quite bad ones. Most of the effects here are
vain attempts, the opening sequence and a few other isolated spots
have well placed well choreographed special effects. Most of the
effects in this movie are either over done and terribly misplaced or
underdone and again misplaced, this is due to the lack of a plot or
any semblance of one. Also the underground passageway, was not only
misplaced, in the wrong movie and badly done, I think it was a more
than vain attempt to throw something into the movie that totally
didn't belong there. Next time you see a mortal person turn into a
dragon in a movie and it looks bad... run, it might be another
installment of Mortal Kombat. Most of the fight scenes are also badly
choreographed, most people can't take a beating like that and then get
up, let alone take on more people. I know this is a movie based on a
video game. But seriously give the audience some credit. </P>
<P>I won't comment on the acting, because there simply was none
in this movie. At least they had the foresight to cast attractive
females, that at least should keep some men in the theater.
(Personally I would have left it I wouldn't have had to wait for my
ride.) I wouldn't go see this movie if I were anyone. I think that the
video game upon which this whole movie is based is more exciting.
Please save your money, throw it out if you must spend it. But do not
see this movie under and circumstances. Go see Aliens if you want
action. The only good thins in the movie were the music(suited my
tastes) and the end... you know when the movie stops. I will not even
rate this movie, that is how bad I think it is. I personally have
never seen a movie this bad. I'm sure that most people could make a
better one. </P>
