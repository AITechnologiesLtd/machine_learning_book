<P>PLOT:
A goofy postman offers to baby-watch his sexy neighbor's kid (a neighbor for
whom he cares for deeply, BTW) but ends up in over his head when a stray dog
also enters the picture. Unbeknownst to them, the dog is actually a FBI
agent's drug-sniffing pooch who just escaped the witness relocation program
and is being chased by mobsters intent on whacking him out. Ooooooh, that
same ol' story again! :)</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This is not so much of a "bad" movie, as it is just a movie that we've seen
a thousand times before. The dog with the "super" powers, the bumbling bad
guys after him, the nice goofy dude who loves his next door neighbor, but is
afraid to tell her, the cute kid who you feel really sorry for, especially
when he cries, etc... It's also a kid's movie, which I generally don't
bother reviewing since my sensibilities and those of 10-year olds are not
exactly on the same plane, but every now and again, I like to take a stab at
one. I guess this one wasn't an awful one to check out, since it did
actually have a few funny moments, a nice performance by Michael Clarke
Duncan and a darn cutey-patootie kid, but sadly the film on the whole,
relies too much on fart, caca jokes and pratfalls for laughs. Then again,
isn't that what kids want? It's basically HOME ALONE with a dog! The
difference being that with the latter film, you actually gave a crap about
the kid in question, and the premise was somewhat believable and sometimes
even...touching.</P>
<P>This movie isn't necessarily as mean-spirited as some of the other gross-out
flicks that have come out over the past couple of years, but there certainly
wasn't much in the characters for anyone to truly identify with. Of course,
the basic idea of any of these kids movies is simply...will it make kids
laugh? I guess in that sense, some of the stuff in this film will definitely
work for the toddlers, as sight gags, over-the-top antics and many a goofy
character permeate the movie, but not really enough to recommend it on the
big screen, I'm afraid. If you wanna tie up the children for an easy ninety
minutes on a lazy Sunday afternoon, there are worse ways to do it. Of
course, don't expect the film to change their lives, or give them any
further insight into the human condition as we know it, but I think ya'll
hear what I'm saying here. Adults, stay away from this one, it's not for
you, and kids, well, see it if the parents want you to. Otherwise, no big
loss.</P>
<P>Oh and by the way, if you don't like David Arquette and "the character" that
he redundantly plays in all of his movies, stop seeing his goddamn movies! I
mean, am I the only one who's sick of people complaining about him playing
the same character over and over again? Dudes/dudettes, if you don't like
him, don't see his movies. Simple as that. Personally, I don't mind his
"goof character", but then again, I don't really think about David Arquette
all that much. Courteney Cox on the other hand...</P>
