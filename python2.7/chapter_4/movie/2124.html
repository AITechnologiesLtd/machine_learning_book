<PRE>                              BOXING HELENA
                       A film review by Jon Webb
                        Copyright 1993 Jon Webb</PRE>
<P>     A while ago I saw a movie called something like LADY IN THE
WINDOW, which was filmed here in Pittsburgh.  It was about a
department store window designer and the man who was sexually obsessed
with her.  She eventually defeated him by incorporating him in her
window design, or something.  I remember Horne's department store
figured prominently.</P>
<P>     BOXING HELENA makes me think of this movie for two reasons.
First, like LADY IN THE WINDOW, it is about sexual obsession.  Second,
LADY IN THE WINDOW is the only movie I can remember that is actually
worse than BOXING HELENA.  (To be fair, I'm sure there have been five
or so more; I just can't think of them right now.)</P>
<P>     BOXING HELENA has the raw, gritty feel of a junior high-school
drama production.  People spit out ridiculous lines with no conviction
whatsoever.  More than anything else, it shows how important good
direction is to a film, and how badly things can go wrong when the
director has no idea whatsoever what she is doing.</P>
<P>     Jennifer Lynch, who directed this amazing bomb, should have worked
for a while as assistant director, or something like that, on other
films.  She might have picked up a few pointers on motivating people,
and learned how to pace a film.  As it is, her creation of this stinker
is a strong argument for the passage of anti-nepotism laws in
Hollywood.  Who knows -- this movie could ultimately have the impact
JFK did, and lead to national legislation. (And probably also to a
movement to make sure film stock is recyclable; it is the only way some
good will come of the print.)</P>
<P>     The actors are real professionals: Sherlyn Fenn, Julian Sands, Art
Garfunkel.  They have all been in reasonable films.  Sherilyn Fenn even
achieves a kind of effective performance here; there's something about
the way she holds herself in the quadraplegic scenes that is moving, a
little.</P>
<P>     One thing that is sad about this movie is that Lynch seems to have
had some interesting ideas.  Besides the plot itself, which is at least
original, there's one scene where Fenn teaches Sands how to make love
to a woman, that is fun.  There are also Sands's nervous habits, like
changing his shirt all the time and putting some sort of ear drops in
his ear, neither of which is explained, that are intriguing in a
Lynch-esque way.</P>
<P>     *No one* should see this film.  Even if you are thinking about it
because it sounds strange and interesting, don't go.  You will live a
happier life if you don't have to carry the memory of this dreck around
with you.</P>
