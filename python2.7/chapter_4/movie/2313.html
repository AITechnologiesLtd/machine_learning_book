<PRE>                            DAZED AND CONFUSED
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1993 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     DAZED AND CONFUSED is the story of the last day of school in 1976
for a collection of Austin, TX teenagers.  It's Richard Linklater, who
also made SLACKER, which has much the same style though DAZED AND
CONFUSED is more coherent and has a plot.</P>
<P>     This film does not evoke Austin's atmosphere as much as SLACKER.
There are few references to special features of Austin, except for the
Moonlight Tower.  These could be students at almost any high school in
the country.</P>
<P>     The point of this film is to evoke the feelings and atmosphere of
1976; it is Yuppie nostalgia.  It works petty well on this level.
There are some minor anachronisms: I don't think the drug culture was
still that strong in 1976, some of the clothing styles are wrong
(bell-bottoms were out, straight legs were in), music was beginning to
have a disco influence, and the reference to urine tests is, of course,
wrong.  But I think most people of age thirty or older will see this
movie as fairly accurate.  People younger than that will be surprised
to see how playful and unthreatening the drug culture was then.</P>
<P>     If this film has a political point, it is that there are other,
better ways of handling drugs and teenage rebellion than our current
approach.  The recent discussion of drug legalization at various levels
of the government make this message timely.</P>
<P>     The plot is coming-of-age; there are many good performance, but
the best is the central character of the film, a junior-high school
student who is initiated into the traditions of high school.  He really
takes control of the film; it's remarkable how someone so young can
display such depth.</P>
<P>     I was mainly struck by the wide range of good performances from
unknown actors.  Linklater has a special talent for creating a whole
raft of believable characters from material that in another director's
hands would look amateur and second-rate.  Undoubtedly his next film
will be a big-budget production, with real actors; I hope he survives
the transition.</P>
