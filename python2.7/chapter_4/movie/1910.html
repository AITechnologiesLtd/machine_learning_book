<P>     While in Mexico, Ruth (Kathleen Turner) and her family suffer a
devastating loss when her husband Alex is killed in an accident.  Some
time later, after being away for years, they return to their North
Carolina home with the hope of starting anew.  Shortly after coming
back and for no apparent reason, Ruth's six-year old daughter Sally
(Asha Menina) withdraws from reality.  Although fluent in three
languages, Sally refuses to speak in any of them, nor will she
acknowledge the presence of her mother.  However, she develops an
affinity for high places and after she nearly kills herself climbing in
a building construction site, the court places her in the custody of
Dr. Jacob Beerlander (Tommy Lee Jones), a psychiatrist who's an expert
in dealing with dissociated children.</P>
<P>     I have the feeling that people will either love or hate this
movie.  Its success depends entirely upon the emotional reaction of the
audience.  It delivers a powerful punch, but the logic of the plot is
uncertain and there are a lot (too many for my taste) of things left
unexplained.  Writer/director Michael Lessac has taken a few liberties
with reality, occasionally stretching things beyond the bounds of
credibility.</P>
<P>     I'll admit to being touched by HOUSE OF CARDS, but even as the
movie worked its skillful manipulation on my emotions, it confounded my
intelligence with a storyline that doesn't seem well thought out.  It's
difficult to talk about specifics without giving things away, but
suffice it to say that every time the movie got me completely immersed
in its peculiar brand of magic, the script did something inconceivable
that left me feeling unsatisfied.</P>
<P>     The acting in HOUSE OF CARDS ranges from passable to excellent.
Kathleen Turner is good as the widowed Ruth.  The character is
occasionally difficult to watch, but that's more because of the
emotions churning within Ruth than because of a flaw in Ms. Turner's
performance.  Tommy Lee Jones is perhaps too restrained as Jacob
Beerlander, and certainly never sympathetic.  Asha Menina, on the other
hand, gives a memorable performance, clearly outacting all the adults.</P>
<P>     One of the most interesting--and believable--scenes in this film
occurs in Dr. Beerlander's school for children as kids with various
problems are introduced to Ruth.  Unlike much of the rest of the film,
this part is not manipulative, but is nevertheless moving, principally
because it seems so real.</P>
<P>     The greatest fault with HOUSE OF CARDS is that too little of it is
believable.  In attempting to play on the audience's emotions as well
as create an almost-mystical atmosphere, this movie has allowed too
many difficult-to-accept contrivances seep into the plot.  Given the
potential power of the script, this annoyed me, in addition to
presenting an unwanted distraction.  I wish I could give a wholehearted
recommendation, but the best I can do is give one with qualifications.
Undoubtedly, there is an audience for this film, but I think it's a
small one.</P>
<P>     I'll reiterate what I said at the beginning of this review.  Most
viewers will probably either love the film or hate it.  Those that can
completely suspend their disbelief and allow the emotional tide of
HOUSE OF CARDS to carry them away (as it did in Houston, where this
movie won top honors at that city's film festival), will love this
picture.  Everyone else will find it slow-moving and hard to accept.
Oddly enough, I find myself somewhere in the middle, having found some
enjoyment in HOUSE OF CARDS, but wishing for a lot more.</P>
