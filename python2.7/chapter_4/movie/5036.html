<P>Even those who don't like war movies are bound to enjoy George Segal's
assured performance as Corporal King in this adaptation of James
Clavell's novel.  Events take place in a Japanese-run POW camp in
Singapore towards the close of WWII.  Refreshingly, this film is not
about escape, or attempted escape - as the prologue states, it is a
story of existence within the camp itself.  Opportunistic King enlists
the services of British prisoner Peter Marlowe (James Fox) after
learning that he can speak Malay.  A bond forms between the two,
though its worth is not revealed until the film's end, when we see
their friendship more as a natural countermeasure against the
unwelcome attention of Lt. Grey (Tom Courtenay), the camp's provost
marshal.  Grey is a strictly by-the-book one-man law enforcement
operation who divides his time between maintaining order in the camp
and staking out King's money-making scams, waiting to pounce on him at
the first opportunity.  He rightly believes in his own integrity but
fails to recognize the same quality in the other, less disciplined,
inmates of the camp.  Grey can't see that each POW has their own way
of dealing with their situation, or that his is to try to create
reason out of chaos. </P>
<P>The camp struggles within a frail system of law and order: everyone
demands justice, revenge, compensation, a deal.  The Japanese seem
just as caught up in the power game as everyone else - control becomes
a shuffle of reports, reprimands, and reprisals.  In this environment,
a hustler like King is sure to thrive, just as any resourceful rat
would.  While the film refers to prisons within the prison (Grey's
jail, the cages beneath the American barracks, the cell they "hire" to
get some privacy), it is the prison within themselves that confines
the men most.  It seems obvious in the case of the repressed provost
marshal, the careworn, numbed surgeon, and the diversionary denial
that several prisoners indulge in, but King is perhaps the most
trapped of all.  "Before this,"  he says of the war, "everybody had it
made except me".  For him, the end of the war is a more pressing
concern than it's continuation: he believes that the Japanese will
kill all their prisoners before surrendering; Grey has vowed to get
even with him when the war is over; and a liberating soldier intimates
an investigation into his activities after the evacuation.  King will
no longer be king.</P>
<P>Subject matter sounds depressing, but KING RAT is actually quite funny
in places (particularly the sequences about a makeshift school lesson
and a secret dinner held for King's friends) and the dialog crackles
whenever Grey is at odds with King or Marlowe.  Courtney and Fox
couldn't be better in their roles.  Performances are first-rate all
round, from John Mills and Denholm Elliott right down to bit parts
like Leonard Rossiter.  John Barry wrote the elegaic score; Bryan
Forbes directed from his own screenplay.</P>
