<PRE>³ Better Than Chocolate ³          * *</PRE>
<P>     The new les-genda romantic comedy ³Better Than Chocolate² has 
a good first act, followed by a rather shitty second, then falls 
apart completely in the third and final.  And, with one scene:  Maggie 
(beautiful red-head Karyn Dwyer), who works in an adult novelty shop, 
has met and fallen for Kim (Christina Cox), a caricature artist; 
Maggie¹s mother (played by Wendy Crewson) has moved in with them both, 
unaware the nature of their relationship, and finds them in bed together.  
She asks what¹s going on, and Maggie lashes out.  About feeling controlled 
by mom, and how their different, and this is her life; blah blah.  It¹s a 
valid argument, actually - or, would be - except that the mother has not 
once to that moment said a thing negative toward her daughter, or criticized 
her in any way.  So, the scene plays a mite forced and overwrought.  Kim, 
who was waiting for her lover to fess up about them, mopes off with a ³fuck 
you², and leaves town; contrived.  There should be another scene, here, of 
the girls arguing just a little longer - more than three seconds, I mean - 
before blowing up at one another and going separate ways.  It gets worse:  
the store where Maggie works has trouble with customs, and in protest, she 
stands naked on window display for the press.  Noone shows up, though, 
aside from gay-bashers who throw flaries into the store, so what was the 
point of doing it that time of night?  And, what was she hoping to prove?  
Maggie hasn¹t shown much concern, one way or another, for the whole censorship 
issue (save for a book ice sculpture, don¹t ask), nor the store¹s welfare.  
So, um... why?  Channeling a bit of emotionally-distraught energy through 
anything but pining futilly over lost love?  I don¹t know; unclear.  And, 
why do gay-bashers have to make an appearance (twice, no less) at all?  We 
even get an explosion (how very Hollywood, Trimark) in the end to tidy 
everything up - relationships, everything - and you can just hear that Sarah 
MacLachlan song coming on, as everybody stands around, happy, and our lovers 
reunite at the last second.
     Too much, too much.  ³Better² has a distinct s.f.w. air about it, 
almost from first frame to last.  The best thing about it, these two girls, 
should¹ve been the film¹s focalpoint, but they're treated as an afterthought.  
Which is a shame, because Cox (who resembles a grown-up twin from ³Full 
House²) and Dwyer make a nice, sexy couple.  They¹re attractive, good-
natured and totally into eachother.  But, they¹re forgotten; two indisputably 
erotic sex scenes, and that¹s it.  I especially liked the dance club sequence, 
where the one girl gives the other a rose;  and, the body painting.  But, 
it¹s hard to compete with such trite filler:  do we care what Maggie¹s 
dingbat mom (fine to be the comic stooge, but show a little intelligence) 
will think of her daughter¹s lifestyle?  Or, if the drag queen (well played 
by Peter Outerbridge) will win over the neurotic store owner?  Does the film 
have to tell us not everyone with same-sex proclivity is accepted in today¹s 
society; duh, we know that, let¹s move on.  
     This is one of the year¹s worst scripts, about so much it¹s about nothing.  
I¹d keep act one, because the dialogue is smooth and witty, remove everything 
else that happens in the film, leave the sex where it is and start over.  Or, 
no - just take these two young leads and put them in something smarter and 
more serious.  They were certainly ready for it. </P>
