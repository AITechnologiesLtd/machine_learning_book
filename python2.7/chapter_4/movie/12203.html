<PRE>THE TRUMAN SHOW (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Peter Weir
Writer: Andrew Niccol
Starring: Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, Ed Harris, Noah Emmerich, Natascha
McElhone, Paul Giamatti, Philip Baker Hall, Ted Raymond, Marc Macaulay,
Holland Taylor, Harry Shearer</P>
<P>Truman Burbank is an insurance salesman who lives on a gorgeous, perfect
Florida island, is married to a perky blond wife, and who has never really
left the island he lives on.  He's also the star of a television show
phenomenon, of which he is conspicuously not aware.  As a baby, Truman was
placed inside a giant dome that covers the entire world he knows of, and
has been raised so that every second of his life is monitored by about 5000
cameras living inside his world.  And Truman has no clue that any of this
is fake.</P>
<P>But every now and then, something will happen that hints at some kind of
conspiracy against him.  In one of the film's earliest scenes, Truman
leaves his house, and a tiny sattelite falls from the sky and lands on the
street outside his house.  A scene later, the radio reports that this was
something that went wrong with a satellite in space.  Sometime later,
Truman sees a bum who looks just like his father, who drowned in a boating
accident, but before he can positively identify him, people come out of
nowhere, drag him onto a bus, and leave him behind.  The morning's paper
says that the city is cutting back on the bums allowed to stay in town.</P>
<P>"The Truman Show" is being billed as Jim Carrey's attempt at drama, after
being heralded by the American Public as a star-studded comic actor, in
such flicks as "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective," "Dumb and Dumber," and "Liar
Liar," but this kind of thinking is only for people who push actors who do
comedy into a corner with all the others, like Robin Williams and Billy
Crystal, and say "You can do drama, but when you do it, you're doing it as
a crossover."  Little do most of these people realize, these guys started
off as regular actors, doing dramas and comedies and everything else, but
found they could make a living starting out in comedy.  Would Robin
Williams become a star as quick as he did if he just did
Off-Off-Off-Off-Broadway dramas?  Because of this typical fallacy, people
will be thinking of this as "The Film Where Carrey Does Drama," which will
make people shudder and stay away, and others going just to see if he can
pull it off.</P>
<P>This is sad because "The Truman Show" is an incredible film.  Whether
viewed as a drama, a comedy, a kafkaesque nightmare, a satirical take on
American media, or even a highly unsubtle Christ story, "The Truman Show"
works, and its star, Jim Carrey, creates one of the most human characters
to inhibit a film in a while, even if he's been living in a giant, man-made
globe his entire life, and has no idea what lies out there.</P>
<P>The key to this film is an incredibly complex yet simple script by Andrew
Niccol, who just wrote and directed one of '97's most intelligent films,
"Gattaca."  That film was one that was filled with lots of great ideas
which worked well together, and it even showed us the powerful emotions of
one man who is struggling to overcome the odds of society.  "The Truman
Show" works on the same kinds of levels.  But Truman, the star of the
universally broadcasted show which airs for 24 hours every day, is a man
who doesn't know that he is limited in what he wants to do.</P>
<P>In the first scenes, we see Truman doing his daily routine of giving
himself a pep talk in the morning, greeting the neighbors with his
catchphrase ("Good Morning; and if I don't see you later, Good Afternoon,
Good Evening, and Good Night!"), driving to work as he listens to a
relaxing piece by Mozart, buying a paper, and working hard at his job.  He
has a big giant smile, which is something Carrey fans will not be shocked
to see.  But we also see him in quiet reflexion later on, and even doing
something secretive that we discover about later on.  He puts on a facade
just like the rest of us, and when he's not around anyone, is as depressed
as the lot of us.</P>
<P>That's why when he really discovers that his whole life is a sham, it's so
devastating.  It occurs all of a sudden, but it's something that he's been
hinted at his whole life.  We see flashbacks he has (shown on his "Greatest
Hits" tapes, which are sold throughout the world), including one where he
fell for a woman (Natascha McElhone) who was not the actress who was
supposed to be playing the girl he eventually marries (Laura Linney, taking
a break from the strong female roles to play a perky wife), who tries to
tell him that his life is a TV show, but fails.  Instead, she becomes one
of the near misses in his life, a woman he pines for.  How many times has
that happned in your life, where you meet someone you're intrigued by, but
who you lose due to something beyond your control, only to peak your
interest for the rest of your life?</P>
<P>As the film goes on from here, Truman tries to escape from his life, and we
begin to meet the men behind the show, who desperately try to cover up,
using anything they have up their sleeves.  The entire show was created by
a creepy looking man named Christof (no, there's no subtlety here), played
by Ed Harris, who at times touches the image he has created which is blown
up on a giant TV set on the wall of the observational hut which controls
the show, sometimes creating music to go along with the events unfolding
(one of them is actually Philip Glass!).  We see him completely obsessed
with his creation, and trying to control it as much as he can, but having
to sometimes deal with TV executives (one played by Paul Thomas Anderson
regular, Philip Baker Hall), and having a crisis when Truman begins
discovering the truth (also, look for one of the control men played by Paul
Giamatti, who played Pig Vomit in Howard Stern's "Private Parts," and
basically stole the film from him).</P>
<P>People may say that all this doesn't sound like a "drama"...well, it ain't.
 It has a serious point, and has some very dramatic moments, but it's
really a very mature comedy.  The film is hilarious, especially in scenes
where we see self-reflexivity in the actual going-ons in the Truman world. 
For instance, the film is run by product placement, and several times in
the film, a character will pick up a product, the camera will zoom in on
them, and they will talk about how great it is.  Weirdly enough, this
gimmick actually gets funnier as it goes on, since the show's veil of
reality gradually weakens as the film moves on.</P>
<P>The film is not only funny, but incredibly moving.  "Gattaca" was actually
criticized for its lack of human emotion (not by me), but people will be
blown away by how much humanity Niccol puts into his script for "The Truman
Show."  We understand the pain Truman lives in because underneath
everything, he's really a human being, and he has to deal with the same
kind of problems we deal with, even if it is in a much restricted space. 
Truman is not some really weird guy who looks like that guy from "The
Mask."  Instead, he's just an average guy who just happens to be the star
of a TV show which he doesn't know about.  The film deals with the fear
that your entire life is one big sham put on for you, basically because a
person only knows what he knows and not what anyone else knows.  We
experience life as it comes to us, not through anyone else.  I've often had
the fear that everyone I know was placed before me on purpose, that there's
some designated course I'm supposed to follow, and I'm sure that there are
other people who have had this fear.  Kafka had a similar fear.  Of course,
I'm not Kafka and neither are you.</P>
<P>This film deals with that idea, but it also has a bitingly saitirical edge,
that all of this works great as a form of media for the masses.  With shows
like "Cops" and "The Real World" being so popular nowadays, it's not long
before something as crazy as this occurs.  We've seen horrific things about
life shown on "Cops" and those stupid Fox specials ("The World's Greatest
Police Chases Part Nineteen!"), and we've seen people who actually WANT to
be filmed for the entire world to see in half-hour doses on "The Real
World;" it's only time before people say they want a real-life "Truman
Show."</P>
<P>This is because humanity's the most fascinating thing in the world.  We, as
humans, love to view other people doing things.  We don't know why, but we
do.  Voyeurism has been dealt with in movies, most notably in "Rear
Window," but "The Truman Show" takes it to a whole other extreme.  The film
shows people all around the world being brought together, and even relaxed,
by watching Truman live his life.  There's a man shown in a tub who lives
his entire life along with Truman, sleeping along with him, and hanging on
to the curtain when something dire happens to him.  There's a group of
Asian people who try to learn English by watching Truman talk to people. 
And there's even a bar where "The Truman Show" is on all the time, and they
even have a counter which shows how many days the show has been on the air.</P>
<P>While this sounds like a horrible thing to do to a human being, the film
accurately, and deftly shows both sides of the issue.  In one scene, we see
Christof arguing with someone over it, and later on, pointing out all the
great things about the world he's created.  There's pain in the world he's
created, but the world has been tailor-made to suit you, while reality is
everyone for themselves.  It's an interesting point, but the other side
just has better ones.</P>
<P>I mentioned it was also an "unsubtle Christ story."  I was getting there,
but I'm afraid it needs little explanation.  Christof is God, and Truman is
Christ, the martyr for the entire world to feel better by watching him live
his life in a sealed-off world.  For those who doubted, even when we
discover that the guy who created the world is named Christof, there's a
memorable scene where Truman walks on the water, or at least seems to.</P>
<P>The brilliance of this film is how it brings all of these ideas together,
instead of seperating them apart and saying "it can be this, and it can be
this, and it can also be this."  This works with other films, but it
woudn't work with "The Truman Show."  While this may seem to cerebral, it's
nevertheless engrossing, and it manages to not shoot over the audience's
head, but also not shoot below.</P>
<P>Oh, and it stars Jim Carrey, who has been a bit of a guilty pleasure for
me, much in the same way Jerry Lewis is.  But here, he emerges as a real
actor, someone who can play a real character, and who can still put his
personal touches on the performance.  Yes, Carrey is funny, and there are
times when he does some of his usual schtick.  But what he doesn't do is
overact, or underact.  And he doesn't look uncomfortable, straining to keep
his hyperkineticity inside.  I used to kinda like him, but now I respect
him because I've seen him act like a person.  If he keeps this up, he may
become the predecessor to Robin Williams instead of Jerry Lewis.  But
really, who cares if the film starts Jim Carrrey not acting incredibly
hyper?  What you want to watch for is the film itself.  And if you're
really going to talk about Carrey, talk about how his performance fits in
with the rest of the film instead of standing apart from it.</P>
