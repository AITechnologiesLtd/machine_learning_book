<PRE>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 and half stars</PRE>
<P>It's somewhat of an irony that the first English speaking film directed
by Shekhar Kapur is, indeed, very English.  Set in the 1500's, it's the
true story of the reign of Elizabeth I, Queen of England.</P>
<P>My philosophy regarding period dramas is simple: if a production crew is
going to bother to dress up in old clothing and film in periodic
settings, make it worthwhile.  Don't just look the part and frolic
around wearing leggings and tights, or - god forbid - we might get
another Sense and Sensibility.  But thanks to some tightly woven
screenplays, there have been times when period dramas can prove
blisteringly powerful.  Wings of the Dove, for example, developed its
setting and characters hand in hand and proved to be an excellent
experience.  As was The Crucible - an adaptation of the classic play -
which reeked of raw energy and almost overwhelming tension.  Elizabeth
does nothing remarkable, and only a few things wrong.</P>
<P>After the death of Queen Mary (Kathy Burke) the crown is passed along to
her sister, Elizabeth (Cate Blancett).  England is in a disastrous
state - bankrupt, has no army, and is under threat from the French.
Chief advisor Sir William Cecil (Richard Attenborough) urges Elizabeth
to marry - either the French Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston) or
her dead sister's husband, King Philip of Spain - to secure the future
of England.  But Elizabeth is enjoying a steamy romance with her
childhood sweet heart Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes).  She values the
opinions of her Master of Spies, Sir Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush), even
though he is disliked at court.  With the responsibility of a nation of
aggressive Protestants and Catholics, Elizabeth must steer her country
out of a crisis, and exposure those plotting against her.</P>
<P>Michael Hirst, who has been writing screenplays for around fifteen
years, penned Elizabeth's script with a messy innocence, of which is
often greatly simplistic.  A considerable portion of this film is
dedicated to the romance between Elizabeth and Dudley, and Hirst makes
it clear that the attraction between these two is based on social
status - the queen having a jolly time seducing a young man, and vice
versa.  We are amply told why they are attracted to each other, but
given no insight into what they actually feel for each other.</P>
<P>Rush's Walsingham eats up another portion, a dark and enigmatic
character who gives a good amount of credibility to the picture.  The
paradox of his personality is given in one moment when Walsingham
explains to a young boy that he has all of his life ahead of him, just
before neatly slicing his throat.  It's that sort of irony which gives
infinite possibilities to his character, but Kapur fails to complete the
difficult task of really bringing him to life.  Geoffrey Rush is well
suited to the role and gives a plausible if not pleasing performance,
looking carefully restrained without appearing as lifeless.</P>
<P>Speculation has risen over Cate Blancett's performance as "The Virgin
Queen", and Polygram Filmed Entertainment is pouring millions of dollars
into promoting her for an Academy Award.  She is bound to please many
viewers, but for me, she never quite fitted the bill.  Blancett has a
look of opaqueness and transparency, and plays her part bit by bit,
seemingly waiting for her next chance to look opaque and transparent.</P>
<P>Critics are no doubt going to praise Elizabeth for its obvious
excellence in visuals and a few very good scenes (balancing some pretty
awful ones). But as people after the media screening began consulting on
how good they thought it was ('That was brilliant, just brilliant,' I
caught one critic saying), I was left cold. I hadn't been able to invest
emotionally in the protagonist because I didn't understand her motives…
I didn't know where she was coming from, or what she was after. That's
strange, since Elizabeth is largely a character study, and if I didn't
get a good insight into the main character, it could have only been
moderately successful.</P>
