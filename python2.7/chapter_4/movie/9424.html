<PRE>The Paper</PRE>
<PRE>Chad'z rating: *** (out of 4 = good)</PRE>
<P>1994, R, 112 minutes [1 hour, 52 minutes]</P>
<PRE>[lighthearted drama/comedy]</PRE>
<P>starring: Michael Keaton (Henry Hackett), Robert Duvall (Bernie White), Glenn
Close (Alicia Clark), Marisa Tomei (Martha Hackett), Randy Quaid (McDougal),
produced by Brain Grazer, Frederick Zollo, written by David and Stephen
Koepp, directed by Ron Howard.</P>
<P>We'd like to think that the "real" media has a much higher standard of
quality and ethics than sensationalistic tabloids, but "The Paper" proves
they really don't. The media is a business just like everything else, and
they'll do whatever it takes to make more money and sell more papers.</P>
<P>The story revolves around Henry Hackett (Keaton), the Metro editor for "The
Sun," a New York tabloid newspaper. It's not the most elite publication in
the world, but it is respected and has good production values, yet Henry
wants to move on to the "New York Sentinel." </P>
<P>We learn a lot about the paper through Henry, and we learn a lot about Henry
through the paper. He is an important editor under a lot of stress, working
long hours and making sure things get done. Back home, his wife Martha
(Tomei) is pregnant with their first child and she feels he is ignoring her
and their marriage is suffering because of his work. But at the same time,
his work is suffering from his marriage. It's a no-win situation and this
goes to show just how stressful jobs in the media can be. I'm sure some of
this is exaggerated for characterization, but Howard plays upon it in such a
way as to make it believable without going over the top. </P>
<P>There are some other interesting characters here: Bernie (Duvall), the
generic editor-in-chief,  (has there ever been an editor-in-chief who wasn't
divorced, balding, and a strict?); Alicia (Close), another editor who is
constantly trying to one-up Henry; and McDougal (Quaid), the 30-something
slacker who somehow has fantastic connections. The characters might not be
anything special, and that's fine with me because it makes the story more
sympathetic.</P>
<P>The sub-plot of the film involves a supposedly race-related murder of two
white businessmen. All the other papers get the scoop on this story except
for The Sun, and this becomes their driving force: to finally beat everyone
else. We follow Henry and McDougal and learn how a paper operates in the
process. </P>
<P>The underlying theme here is truth as "If it's wrong we'll print the
exclusive that it was wrong tomorrow, but for now we go with this" can
constantly be heard in the background. Henry seems to be one of the last
people who has some kind of values and would rather have the truth be known
even if it means selling fewer papers.</P>
<P>The last act involves Henry and Alicia fighting over what story should be
the front page catch, will it be either a headline that is wrong but will not
be known to the public, or will it be the truth? And if the truth should be
published, it will take a lot of effort and production time to do it, which
is more expensive. The fact this is even questioned is depressing in a way.
Our news may depend upon two people's personal disputes? </P>
<P>Still, "The Paper" is a good film and it certainly is interesting to watch
the production of a newspaper and see how a story is portrayed through the
storyteller.</P>
