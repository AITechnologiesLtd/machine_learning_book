<PRE>"Traffic"</PRE>
<P>The world of international drug trafficking is a high stakes and high-risk
world where billions of dollars can be made pandering to the addictions of
American society. Steven Soderbergh's latest work, "Traffic," explores that
world and its players while showing the tragic results of addiction on the
family.</P>
<P>Soderbergh, since his radical debut in 1989 with "sex, lies and video
tape," has marched to his own filmmaking drummer and, though not always
successful ("Kafka"), has always been interesting. He not only proves to be
innovative, he can also wow the movie-going public with mainstream stuff,
too ("Erin Brockovitch"). On the heels of the latter film, Soderbergh could
have rested on his laurels but, instead, hits us with one of the best films
released in 2000.</P>
<P>The huge ensemble cast is wonderfully utilized to tell the several
different stories that inexorably intertwine and come together in the end.
Mexican cop Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) works the border around
Tijuana with his friend and partner Manolo Sanchez (Jacob Vargas) under
Mexico's numero uno crime fighter, General Salazar (Tomas Milian). Their
job is to destroy the powerful Obregon drug cartel that is funneling
billions of dollars of illicit narcotics into the US.</P>
<P>Across the border, pretty housewife, Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones),
is shocked to learn that her businessman husband Carl (Steven Bauer) was
arrested for drug trafficking. Her greatest fear in life, that she be left
a "debt-ridden 30-year old mother of two," is about to be realized if she
can't figure a way out. She is in hock to the cartel for millions and her
life threatened, forcing the innocent women to become a ruthless
businesswoman in her own right as survival, then greed, take over.</P>
<P>Michael Douglas is Ohio Supreme Court Justice Robert Wakefield, a
conservative, anti-drug advocate recruited by the President to become the
new US drug czar. While Wakefield throws himself into learning all he can
about drug smuggling, his teenage daughter, Caroline (Erika Christensen),
is a willing participant in the drug culture her father is tasked to
destroy. For Caroline, it is a steady downward spiral as she, first,
experiments with cocaine and freebase, then gives herself over sexually for
the intoxicating numbness of heroin.</P>
<P>Undercover DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis
Guzman) rep the US involvement in the War on Drugs as they work overtime to
build their own case against the Obregon drug cartel. They bust mid-level
drug dealer Eduardo Ruiz (Mel Ferrer) and cut a deal to get him to testify
against Helena's husband. From here, the stories take on a further
complexity as the inexorably intertwine.</P>
<P>Soderbergh musters the best ensemble performance of the year from this big
cast that is also supplemented with a plethora of cameo perfs that flesh
out the complexly crafted tale. Michael Douglas and Benicio Del Toro give
Oscar-worthy performances as Judge Wakefield and honest cop Rodriguez. The
beauty about these and other perfs in the film is the depth the actors get
to plumb with their characters. Without a great deal of screen time, each
actor develops his or her role into multi-dimensional people. This is a
combination of fine acting and a deft hand by the helmer.</P>
<P>Catherine Zeta-Jones is cast in the less than glamorous role of a
protective mom. The pretty actress is given a character, in Helena, which
arcs across the screen. The confused, scared wife and mother is not someone
to be taken lightly as she learns of the extent of her financial burden. As
Helena takes control of her destiny, we see a frightening ruthlessness
develop. When she orders, "I want the principal witness against my husband
killed," she knows what she is doing and what she wants. It's the first
film where Zeta-Jones isn't just a pretty face and she acquits herself
well.</P>
<P>Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman ably man the action north of the border in
their own quest to bring down Juan Obregon. They have the more meat and
potatoes story as they catch, then turn state's witness, trafficker Ruiz.
This part of the tale is reminiscent of Steve McQueen's "Bullitt" as the
two cops struggle to keep their ward alive long enough to testify.</P>
<P>There are, as I said, lots of cameos and small roles with the likes of
James Brolin, Peter Riegert and Albert Finney showing up. Dennis Quaid is a
prominent background character as Helena's attorney and advisor. Amy Irving
is effective as the judge's wife, Barbara.</P>
<P>Tech credits are the best. Photography, by Soderbergh himself, is striking
as it changes from crisp, colder images when north of the border to soft,
sepia tones when south. The rest of the techs are just as notable. Stephen
Gaghan's script is as remarkable as the rest of the efforts on this film,
weaving a complex tale that loses none of its threads.</P>
<P>Steven Soderbergh gives a double whammy this year and could have simply
rode on the popular coattails of "Erin Brockovitch" and its star Julia
Roberts. Instead, he produced one of the best, if not the best, American
films of year 2000. I give "Traffic" an A.</P>
