<P>"Paths of Glory" is one of the greatest war films ever made, an indictment on 
war and the complex morality behind the decisions made in trench warfare. 
What helps make it so complex and involving in every scene is the direction 
by Stanley Kubrick and the exquisitely precise and multilayered screenplay by 
Kubrick, Calder Willingham and Jim Thompson. </P>
<P>Set in France in 1916, the film begins with the arrival of General Broulard 
(Adolphe Menjou) at a French chateau where he meets with General Mireau 
(George Macready) to discuss the golden opportunity of taking the "Ant Hill," 
a no man's land held by the Germans. The notion is that if Mireau takes the 
command, he may be promoted and it is also an event for the media to focus 
on. Mireau, the determined optimist, immediately tells Colonel Dax (Kirk 
Douglas) of the news, much to Dax's dismay. Dax defends his position by 
quoting from Samuel Johnson ("patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel") 
and feeling his men are not up to the task so soon. Accompanying Broulard is 
Major Saint-Auban (Richard Anderson, best known for his role in "The Six 
Million Dollar Man" TV show) who refers to the soldiers as having a herd 
instinct, or stated as "an animal sort of thing." Dax corrects the major, 
reminding him they are human after all. Nevertheless, Dax is convinced of 
taking the "Ant Hill," perhaps in fear he will be rep
laced by someone who will not take proper care of his men. Thus the colonel 
tells his men that they must be prepared to attack, though the fact that the 
weather will be clear and sunny as opposed to foggy and cloudy establishes 
this battle as a losing proposition. </P>
<P>"Paths of Glory" has two scenes of battle, one quiet and serene and the other 
noisy and confusing. The first scene is of a patrol organized to navigate no 
man's land. They include the alcoholic Lieutenant Roget (Wayne Morris), 
Corporal Paris (Ralph Meeker) and Private Lejeune (Ken Dibbs). The area is 
already littered with shell holes, corpses, lots of wire and rubble. Lejeune 
is inadvertently killed by Lieutenant Roget, the first accused of "cowardice 
in the face of the enemy" by Corporal Paris. </P>
<P>The other battle is of course the taking of Ant Hill, which becomes a 
haelstorm of explosions and bullets in and around the trenches. The men fear 
getting too close to the German wire because of the intensity of the 
explosions, and are almost killed by General Mireau who is infuriated that 
they would stay in the trenches to avoid enemy fire. Three soldiers under 
Dax's command are arbitrarily chosen to be court-martialed and face execution 
for "cowardice in the face of the enemy." One of them is Corporal Paris, who 
is ironically picked by Lieutenant Roget.</P>
<P>"Paths of Glory" follows the trial leading to the execution, seen as justice 
for men who refused to fight, and Kubrick and the writers Willingham and 
Thompson ask tough questions with little in the way of a clear-cut 
resolution. Should these men be executed for acting cowardly and not 
advancing in no man's land? Is General Mireau any less guilty for almost 
having his men killed by their own troops for not advancing? At one point, 
Colonel Dax even asks to be set as an example for his men by being executed, 
but is instead left as a defense lawyer for the three charged men in the 
court martial proceedings. What Kubrick shows, and what has become a staple 
of his later work, is that the powerful men at the top, namely General 
Broulard and General Mireau, see these soldiers as nothing more than animals 
and treat them as such, stating that if the enemy fire was so intense, the 
result would have been corpses littered around the trenches, not cowards. 
Ironically, during the penultimate final scene in the chateau, Gen
eral Mireau reminds Broulard that the man he stabs in the back is a soldier. 
The inhumanity and lack of sympathy is powerfully shown in Kubrick's treatise 
on war, and lead the way to many more ambiguous moral lessons in human 
behavior in films such as "Dr. Strangelove" and especially "A Clockwork 
Orange." </P>
<P>Based on the 1935 World War I novel by Humphrey Cobb, "Paths of Glory" is 
emotionally wrenching and thrillingly realized. Every sequence is masterfully 
composed and framed, including the dolly shots through the trenches where Dax 
and General Broulard frequently travel while explosions are heard in the 
background. The court martial sequence in the chateau is as tense and 
nail-biting as the execution itself.</P>
<P>The dialogue is also crisp and direct. I loved the conversations between 
Broulard, Mireau and Dax in the chateau, a setting for a different kind of 
battleground where words and strategies are exchanged in reference to the 
lives of the soldiers. Backstabbing and political ambition are primary goals, 
though Dax is an idealist - he cares for his men and says or does nothing as 
a means of promotion from his rank. The higher-ups are of different mindsets, 
and it is extraordinary to watch Kirk Douglas's blunt, sympathetic Dax, 
Adolphe Menjou's arrogant, pitiless General Broulard, and the cold, 
remorseless General Mireau brilliantly portrayed by George Macready commingle 
and argue over the reality of war's traumas and heartaches. </P>
<P>"Paths of Glory" is a tough, demanding work that generated a lot of 
controversy over its cynical presentation of how men of power handle their 
own men in the face of war. But there is beauty too, as evidently shown in 
the final shot where a German farm girl (Suzanne Christian, who became Mrs. 
Kubrick at that time) sings a sentimental song from the "Musical Memories of 
Germany" and causes the audience of soldiers to weep when they were initially 
jeering her. I also like what could be a throwaway moment where Private 
Arnaud (Joseph Turkel, who later appeared in "The Shining") describes how 
being shot down and killed instantly is preferable to being wounded. There is 
humanity in these men, these soldiers who fight in the trenches for the 
benefit of pleasing some higher-ranking officials and, of course, to win the 
war. Here is an anti-war film that sticks to its guns and shows, in the words 
of Ernest Hemingway, that war is a crime no matter how justified. </P>
