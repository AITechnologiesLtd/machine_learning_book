<P>"102 Dalmatians" & "How the Grinch Stole Christmas"</P>
<P>I just had some major minor surgery and I was in need of some entertainment
and distraction from my own personal plight. Opportunity reared its furry
head for me with a Saturday morning screening of Disney's sequel "102
Dalmatians." What better way to get my mind off of my own aches and pains
than watching Glenn Close bring new outrageous behavior to my favorite
villain of all time - Cruella De Vil. I ensconce myself in a comfortable
seat and settled down with the other kids in the audience to see Cruella,
once again, foiled in her nefarious plans to create the ultimate spotted
puppy coat.</P>
<P>The holiday release of "102 Dalmatians" comes as no surprise following the
$300-million plus worldwide gross for the 1996 live action remake of the
1961 seminal Disney animation, "101 Dalmatians." The focus of the new film
is on Cruella De Vil right from the start as we meet the penitent
psychiatric patient who has learned to love animals, not wear them. But, we
know something is going to wrong, drastically wrong, and the wicked Cruella
will turn to her old, evil ways. This time, it's up to the spotless little
Dalmatian Oddball and the rest of the canine crew to put a stop to
Cruella's latest, wicked plans.</P>
<P>When Cruella leaves the psychiatric care of Doctor Pavlov (David Horovitch)
she is fully cured of her infamous fur fetish and the terms of her parole
dictate that she never steal another puppy. If she violates the rules of
her release, her remaining wealth, 8-million pounds, will be given to the
dog shelters in the county. But, Cruella has become "Ella" and is a changed
woman who dedicates her life to the safety and well being of the canine
population. She selects a failing, ramshackle animal shelter, The 2nd
Chance, run by kindly naïf Kevin Shephard (Ioan Gruffudd), as her
rehabilitation project and throws herself into her philanthropic work.
Kevin honestly believes that Ella is a changed person and lets her fund the
shelter's rebuild. Not so for Ella's doubtful parole officer Chloe Simon
(Alice Evans), a Dalmatian owner herself, who doesn't think that a leopard
like Cruella can ever really change her spots.</P>
<P>Chloe is proven right when the striking of the bells of Big Ben toll the
end of Dr. Pavlov's experiment as Ella disappears and Cruella De Vil
reemerges in all her wicked glory. She is now bound and determined to get
her precious spotted coat and even enlists the help of her arch rival in
the fur world, Jean Pierre Le Pelt (Gerard Depardieu), to collect the 102
Dalmatian puppies she'll need to create her ultimate design - now with
hood. Kevin and Chloe are pretty helpless in stopping Cruella with Kevin
being framed and arrested for the theft of some of the pups, so it's up to
Chloe's canine companions, Dipstick (son of Pongo), his mate, Dottie, and
their puppies, Little Dipper, Domino and Oddball, to foil Cruella's cruel
plans. Oddball is the only spotless one in the clan, which makes him the
over-achiever needed to lead the puppies and the other canine colleagues
against Cruella and her lethal scheme.</P>
<P>One area where "102 Dalmatians" misses the mark is its audience aim. There
is far too much talky dialogue and adult level humor and too little stuff
for the smaller kids. Don't get me wrong, the puppy (or "poopy" as Le Pelt
calls them) action is fun and exciting, especially the big climax/chase
that enters an enormous automated bakery that proves to be Cruella's
downfall. But, there isn't enough of this kiddy-level action. You could
hear the noise level increase in the theater as the smaller kids got bored
with the plot hatching between Cruella and the fur-clad Le Pelt. Not giving
the younger kids something to occupy their attention is going to be very
annoying at full theaters where the adults won't be able to hear the higher
brow humor because of the din of the youngsters.</P>
<P>The humor is, overall, more geared to the adults and older kids in the
audience. There is a dark, sinister nature to the film in the second half,
culminating in Cruella being thrust into an oven a la the wicked witch in
the "Hansel and Gretel" fairytale that provides some disturbing images. The
mayhem is only implied and never realized through the film, but the idea of
a just dessert ending for Cruella borders on the scary, especially for
younger auds.</P>
<P>While the animal stars don't speak (with one notable exception that I'll
get to in a moment), the filmmakers still get some remarkable performances
out of the canine cast. Mom and Dad Dalmatians, Dipstick and Dottie, are
shown as a loving couple who adore their kids. The human-like spin that is
put on their interaction has the same anthropomorphic feel as Disney's
animation, "Lady and the Tramp." (The spaghetti scene from the older
animation is used to propel the love story between the good guys, Kevin and
Chloe.) My favorite animal "performance," though, is voiced by Eric Idle as
the neurotic Macaw, Waddlesworth. The parrot, it seems, believes that he
is, in fact, a dog and not a bird at all. His neurosis, coupled with
sharp-tongued, witty dialog, makes the very vocal bird an odd but endearing
member of the team. Even when Waddlesworth does fly like an eagle, he
declares, "I'm not a rottweiler, I'm a retriever." He steals the show
whenever he gets a word in.</P>
<P>The human actors don't fare quite as well as their furry and feathered
counterparts, though. Except for Glenn Close, who has a remarkably good
time and gives her all to the character of Cruella - the actress does much
of her stunt work in the big climax - the other humans aren't given much to
do. Depardieu's Le Pelt must have looked good on paper, but the big actor
just seems out of place. Gruffudd and Evans, as Kevin and Chloe are there,
well, because the script says the characters exist. Neither actor is given
a real character to work with and there isn't much the amiable-seeming
thesps can do to reverse this. Tim McInnerny, as Cruella's manservant
Alonso, is the only other human, besides Close, who gets to put any meat on
his character's bones. Alonso suffers from conflicted loyalty as he is
faithful to his employer but also has a good heart and is against the plot
to create the "hooded spotted poopy coat."</P>
<P>Costuming by Academy Award winner Anthony Powell is a major asset for the
film. Cruella is outfitted in some of the most bizarre and interesting
creations since Queen Whatsherface in "The Phantom Menace." From the very
start, when we meet her, fully rehabbed, in her striped prison togs with
the jaunty cap emblazoned with her prisoner number, "6660," we are seeing a
tour de force in costumes. Most interesting are the "Ella" outfits as the
reformed Cruella shuns furs and takes on a clever political correctness. (I
was even told that one outfit is in a houndstooth pattern - hee hee.) Ella
is a true matron of her cause and looks every bit the lacquered lady -
check out her "nun's habit" outfit she wears as she emerges from prison.
It's brilliant. Her change back into Cruella literally springs out at us as
it harks back to the 1996 film with fur taking over, once again, as the
principle material du costume. The fur motif doesn't work anywhere near as
well for Gerard Depardieu, who looks more like a well-groomed bear in the
furry costumes for Le Pelt.</P>
<P>Everything around the action - the aforementioned costumes, the innovative
sets by Assheton Gorton and the sparkling photography by veteran lenser
Adrian Biddle - help keep the production on an even and high quality keel.
First time live action helmer Kevin Lima, who so able handled the Disney
film "Tarzan," utilizes his animation skills to bring the necessary cartoon
quality that marked the original as a hallmark family film. The weakest
point is the script by a gaggle of writers - Kristen Buckley & Brian Regan
(from their original story) and Bob Tzudiker & Noni White - which has to
follow up on the charm of the original story by Dodie Smith. The scribes do
a fair job, but the story feels like it's done by committee. The ending
drags on too long so the whole effort seems more extended than its 90+
minutes.</P>
<P>The puppies are cute and Cruella remains an icon of wickedness, but I hope
that "102 Dalmatians" is it. I don't think I can take "103 Dalmatians." I
give it a B-.</P>
