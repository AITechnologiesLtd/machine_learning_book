<P>      Rowan Atkinson is the most gifted and versatile comic performer in
the English-speaking world, and I only qualify the statement that much for
fear of appearing more cosmopolitan than I am.  No one is as equally deft
at delivering withering insults (see the various incarnations of his
"Black Adder" character) and performing priceless, wordless physical
comedy (see the television episodes of "Mr. Bean").  As both a jokester
and a classic clown, he is unrivaled.  That most Americans know him best
-- if at all -- as FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL's malapropping priest is a
problem in serious need of correction.</P>
<P>     I'm not sure the film version of BEAN is going to do it.  Atkinson's
Mr. Bean is a marvelous comic creation -- a gangly, goggle-eyed maladroit
with the mischievous self-absorption of an adolescent and the one-size-too
small brown suit to match.  In the vignettes which comprise Bean's
television adventures (seen in America on HBO and public television), plot
is never permitted to intrude on the pursuit of a hilarious bit of
pantomime.  Launched from a simple situation into wild flights of humor,
Bean's actions _are_ the plot of a "Mr. Bean" episode.</P>
<P>     BEAN the movie makes the critical error of jamming Bean into the same
tired, conventional premise which as served as the vehicle for a hundred
unconventional comedians.  To wit:  Bean, an inept employee at London's
National Gallery, is shipped to the States by superiors who are only too
glad to be rid of him.  David Langley (Peter MacNicol), the curator of a
prestigious Los Angeles gallery, is expecting a brilliant scholar to
preside over the unveiling of "Whistler's Mother."  He is not expecting
the man who promptly begins wrecking his home, his family life and his
job.  Can you say "fish out of water?"</P>
<P>     Atkinson deserves better.  When he's allowed to do his thing, he is a
genius.  There are a few brilliant Bean moments in BEAN:  the opening
sequence which finds him shaving every exposed surface on his head; a
super-charged ride on an amusement park motion simulator; Bean pushing a
draped painting through a hallway as though it were a gurney.  The
situations set up by Richard Curtis and Robin Driscoll aren't really the
problem in BEAN.  It's director Mel Smith who misses the point that "Mr.
Bean" isn't about other people reacting to Bean's absurd antics; it's
about Bean responding to his own absurd antics.  MacNicol, Harris Yulin
and the rest of the supporting players are asked to play straight men to
Atkinson, who doesn't need them.  He's a one-man comedy team.</P>
<P>     In one sense, I'm being a bit more harsh than BEAN deserves, because
it's still more entertaining than most Hollywood comedies.  Atkinson is
too energetic a performer to allow BEAN to drift into unwatchability,
making for a film which will provide audiences with plenty of satisfying
laughs.  But I can't help cringing at all the miscalculations that went
into BEAN, most notably the sentimental message which becomes
unnecessarily obtrusive.  After speaking fewer than a dozen words through
most of the film, Bean cuts loose with a heart-felt speech which proves he
has learned a valuable lesson on his trip to America.  Mr. Bean growing as
a character?  Stuff and nonsense.  I'd much rather that the makers of BEAN
learned the lesson and produce a BEAN film deserving of the name, one
which doesn't suffer from forced attempts at creating a feature length
narrative.  Let Bean wreak his merry havoc.  Let his beloved Teddy have
more than a token cameo appearance.  Let Rowan Atkinson show the world
that he's one of the funniest men alive.  Everyone will be happier when he
does.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 half-baked Beans:  6.</PRE>
