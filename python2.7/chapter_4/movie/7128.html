<P>     Spending 100 minutes with the Geldharts seems a little too much 
like a penance for past misdeeds.  THE SUBSTANCE OF FIRE, adapted by Jon 
Robin Baitz from his 1989 play, is an unfortunate motion picture filled 
with poorly-developed characters and half-realized, cliche-riddled plot 
elements.  Aside from a powerful performance by Ron Rifkin (reprising 
his stage role) and a few quietly effective scenes, there's not much 
reason to subject yourself to a film this off-putting.</P>
<P>     One of the most evident flaws in THE SUBSTANCE OF FIRE is that it 
doesn't put much effort into developing its characters.  Each is 
introduced with an anecdote (one is teaching, another is on television, 
a third is having a meeting with Japanese bankers), and that's supposed 
to be sufficient to establish who they are.  It's not, and, as a result, 
we have to work hard to generate any emotional response to them as the 
movie progresses.  Too often, it seems like we're watching the 
inventions of a writer rather than unique individuals.</P>
<P>     Rifkin plays Isaac Geldhart, the sole survivor of a family that was 
wiped out in the Holocaust.  Isaac carries around a huge burden of 
guilt, and, as a form of atonement, he has devoted the bulk of his adult 
life to publishing volumes about the Holocaust and its aftermath.  
Geldhart/Kreeger Books has become "the single most important publisher 
of serious literature", but the imprint's specialization has led to 
financial ruin.  It has been six years since Geldhart/Kreeger has had a 
bestseller and the firm is "hemorrhaging money".  Without some sort of 
change, it will go under, but Isaac is unwilling to compromise. </P>
<P>     So Isaac's children get involved to keep the company afloat.  Each 
represents a different, easily-identifiable stereotype.  There's Aaron 
(Tony Goldwyn), the gay child who never got out from under his father's 
thumb.  He manages Geldhart/Kreeger's finances but has been given no 
creative control.  Martin (Timothy Hutton) suffers from cancer, but it's 
in remission.  He tries to avoid his family as often as he can, since 
the stress of interacting with them could cause his symptoms to re-
emerge.  Finally, there's Sarah (Sarah Jessica Parker), who hosts a 
children's television show while engaging in a dalliance with a married 
man (Roger Rees).  Like Martin, she prefers not to get involved in the 
firm, but changes her mind when Aaron makes it clear that, if things 
continue as they're going, there won't be a business at all.</P>
<P>     THE SUBSTANCE OF FIRE doesn't offer much to chew on.  The story 
isn't especially engrossing and neither Baitz nor director Daniel G. 
Sullivan (who directed the stage play) bring anything new or vital to 
its telling.  For the most part, we're watching characters go through 
the motions.  It's dull, pedantic, and pointless, and the final coup de 
grace, which is supposed to bring a sense of closure to the situation, 
feels contrived and out-of-place.  It's an ending that makes the whole 
movie seem like a cheat.</P>
<P>     The weightiest and most potentially interesting aspect of THE 
SUBSTANCE OF FIRE centers around Isaac's guilt and how it has shaped his 
life.  As a child, he was hidden from the Nazis, but he had to watch as 
his parents and siblings were taken away to their deaths.  Had the 
script chosen to explore Isaac's tortured psyche more deeply, this could 
have been a compelling issue.  Instead, however, we are presented with a 
frustratingly shallow surface view that depicts Isaac as an ogre who's 
more interested in controlling his children than loving them.  Rifkin's 
top-notch performance gives Isaac a forceful personality, but not a 
particularly deep or sympathetic one. It's easier to dislike Isaac than 
to understand him.  And, rather than dealing with the generational 
conflict in a forthright manner, Baitz's script is compelled to 
introduce yet another standby plot device -- inflict Isaac with creeping 
senility.</P>
<P>     Aside from Rifkin, the acting of the leads is uniformly bland.  
Neither Timothy Hutton, Tony Goldwyn, nor Sarah Jessica Parker seem 
comfortable in their roles.  In Parker's case, this is surprising, since 
she played Sarah on stage.  Two of the supporting cast members -- Ronny 
Graham as the author of a history of Nazi medical experiments and 
Elizabeth Franz as Isaac's devoted secretary -- steal scenes, although 
not enough to prevent THE SUBSTANCE OF FIRE from inducing boredom.</P>
<P>     For a film like this to work, the characters have to seem real, the 
situations have to be interesting, and the approach needs to be fresh.  
Baitz and Sullivan are 0-for-3.  Tired dysfunctional family cliches 
utilizing stock characters rarely translate into effective drama. What 
little impact this film attains can be attributed directly to Rifkin's 
work.  Without him, this would have been a sorry project.  Ultimately, 
THE SUBSTANCE OF FIRE is pretty insubstantial.</P>
