<PRE>TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * * *</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: James Cameron
Written by: James Cameron, William Wisher</PRE>
<P>It's been ten years since the first terminator came from the future and 
tried to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the mother of John Connor 
(Edward Furlong), who will grow up to lead the human resistance against the 
machines. Now, two such machines have come to the past. One, the T-800 
(Arnold Schwarzenegger), has been sent by the resistance to protect young 
John Connor. The other, an advanced prototype called the T-1000 (Robert 
Patrick), has been sent to kill John. At this point in time, John is a 
juvenile delinquent, living with his foster parents (Jenette Goldstein, 
Xander Berkeley), who he can't stand. Sarah Connor is locked in a mental 
institute, under the "care" of Dr. Silberman (Earl Boen). Now that the 
machines have returned, Sarah realizes there may be only one way to defeat 
them once and for all: kill Miles Dyson (Joe Morton), the man directly 
responsible for the creation of the machines; or destroy Skynet, the massive 
computer, now in its infancy, which will one day control the world.</P>
<P>Even now, nine years after its release, the special effects in James 
Cameron's "Terminator 2: Judgement Day" are astounding. In honor of its 
recent re-release on DVD, I've decided to write a review for this classic 
film. This was a film released just at the end of the really special special 
effects era. Back when we could still be dazzled by what was on screen. Now 
it's grown quite impossible to do that. After all, most people weren't 
particularly impressed by the latest "Star Wars" film, and that featured 
some of the most dazzling effects ever. Still, because it was released when 
it was, people will always remember spectacular shots of the T-1000 
reassembling itself after Arnold blasts it into a million pieces, or turning 
into liquid, squeezing through a window, and changing back to human form. 
These are the kind of astounding scenes that, if released today, would be 
viewed as nothing new. Is that a testament to how far we've come, or to how 
much we've come to expect from our movies? End of philosophical moment.</P>
<P>"Terminator 2" is a Schwarzenegger movie, through and through. It hides 
behind a fairly intelligent plot, but when Arnold gets lines like "Hasta la 
vista, baby," you know what kind of movie this is. If you're not a fan of 
Arnold, in all his cheesy glory, stay away from this movie. Otherwise, 
you'll love seeing him in his prime. Robert Patrick gives a remarkably good 
turn as the T-1000, but he's no Arnold (as if you needed to be told that). 
Linda Hamilton plays Sarah Connor more than a little differently this time 
around. In the first film Sarah was obviously confused by what was 
happening. In this one she's so prepared it's almost frightening. She has 
hidden gun caches, training in the use of every weapon imaginable, an 
insanely high tolerance for pain, and a mean streak that would scare 
Hannibal Lecter. Finally, we have newcomer (at the time) Edward Furlong. He 
actually gave a fairly good performance for a first time actor, only 
overdoing it on the emotion every now and then. I'm not sure if this is a 
sign of real acting talent from Furlong, or directorial ability from Cameron 
(back before he sold out to the man and made "Titanic"). Whatever it was, 
I've been sorry to see Furlong wasted on useless movies since his debut 
("Detroit Rock City", anyone?).</P>
<P>I have only one major complaint with "Terminator 2", but it's a doozy. In 
the first "Terminator" film, the story revolved entirely around Sarah Connor 
and Kyle Reese trying to escape the killing machine. There was nothing that 
could stop it, nothing that could slow it down. It just kept coming and 
coming. This filled that movie with a wonderful sense of dread and 
foreboding, as we watched our heroes try in vain to stop their enemy. In 
"Terminator 2", the story shifts drastically. It's no longer about trying to 
escape the terminator, this one is about trying to stop Skynet and change 
the future. Now I know they couldn't make this movie about the exact same 
thing as the first one, but I think if you compare the two the first script 
is superior. That's not to say this one is bad, it's just not as dark, 
twisted, and (frankly) entertaining as its predecessor. Through most 
segments of this movie, all I could think about was wanting the T-1000 to 
come back on screen. I really didn't care about a computer factory being 
destroyed.</P>
<P>Special effects aside, there are a few other really great things about 
"Terminator 2". The action scenes are marvelously shot, both gun fights and 
the hand to hand combats. There are two really well done car chases in the 
film: one involving John Connor on a motorcycle and the T-1000 in a semi; 
the other involving a helicopter and a police van. Both these chase scenes 
do a great job building suspense, and Cameron knows exactly when to call 
them to a halt. The film's score, by composer Brad Fiedel ("True Lies") is 
simply perfect. It uses a lot of the same music he created for the first 
film, but it sounds more metallic and machine like this time around. The 
film does run a long 137 minutes (152 for the director's cut), but the 
action seldom lets up and it shouldn't feel half that long. I'd recommend 
"Terminator 2" to those who enjoyed the first one, and to fans of science 
fiction in general. I wouldn't recommend it to those looking for a movie 
about time travel because Cameron generally ignores all the traditional 
arguments regarding paradoxes and such (rightfully so, I might add). I give 
the movie four out of five stars.</P>
