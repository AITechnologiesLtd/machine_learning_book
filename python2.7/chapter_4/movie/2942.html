                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                           (<A HREF="mailto:mark.leeper@att.com">mark.leeper@att.com</A>)
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  This amiable, light-weight
     romantic comedy has Marisa Tomei chasing over Italy in a
     quest for the man predicted to be her perfect match.
     The viewer won't need a crystal ball to divine the plot
     twists coming.  Rating: +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Faith Corvatch (played by Marisa Tomei) has known since she was a
girl who the right man for her was.  Both a Ouija board and a fortune
teller has told her that the man fated to be her great love was someone
named Damon Bradley.  She has looked for Bradley all her life.  She has
become infatuated with the idea that fate has chosen a mate for her, if
only she can find the elusive Mr. Bradley.</P>
<P>     Eventually she has to give in to the inevitable and find someone
else.  Her fiance, a podiatrist, is not the most romantic choice for a
husband, but Damon Bradleys do not show up every day.  But a few days
before her marriage her husband gets a phone call from a friend on his
way to an international flight to Venice.  The friend's name is Damon
Bradley.  Faith rushes to the airport, but not in time to intercept the
man whom fate has intended for her.  Her only chance to meet the man
promised to her by fate is to go with her best friend Kate, and fly to
Venice to chase down Damon.  After a journey from Pittsburgh to Venice
the fates finally arrange for her to run into Damon on the streets of
Rome.  Damon (played very winningly by Robert Downey Jr.) fall into
each other's arms, love at first sight.  Then Damon makes an admission
about himself that will change their relationship entirely that will
change Faith's mind about him.  Damon will have to prove he really is
the man that the fates have intended for Faith.  For more--far too much
more--information about the plot twists, see the trailer running in
theaters.</P>
<P>     Norman Jewison directs as well as co-produces hoping, possibly,
that the colorful Italian characters and soundtrack music will capture
some of success of his MOONSTRUCK.  That film was about older and,
frankly, better drawn and more interesting characters.  Here the
attempt is not to so much to define characters but to but to create a
very light piece of froth somewhere between SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE and
ROMAN HOLIDAY--elements borrowed from both are present--and take
advantage of warmly romantic Italian settings and seductive music,
particularly "Some Enchanted Evening" from SOUTH PACIFIC.  Sven
Nykvist's camera captures romantic scenes so that they feel romantic
without being overly Hallmark-ish.</P>
<P>     Marisa Tomei plays her role brash but with more of a fragile
quality than her Oscar-winning role in MY COUSIN VINNY.  Robert Downey
Jr. as her possible perfect romantic mate is a trifle bland but winning
enough to have the audience rooting for him to win her a second time.
More personality is vested in Bonnie Hunt's witty Kate.  Hunt's Kate
seems more than a little like the sort of character Stockard Channing
plays.  Rounding out are the cast Fisher Stevens and Joaquim De Almeida
as Kate's husband and would-be lover.</P>
<P>     This is one Norman Jewison film that will not make much of a
splash, but it is competent and pleasant.  Give it a +1 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
