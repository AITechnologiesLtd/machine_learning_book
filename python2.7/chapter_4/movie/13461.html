<PRE>LEGENDS OF THE FALL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(1994) US, 133 mins </PRE>
<P>THE CREDITS: Directed by Edward Zwick … Starring Brad Pitt, Anothony
Hopkins, Aidan Quinn, Henry Thomas, Julia Ormond</P>
<P>THE VERDICT: Grim and unyielding, but nevertheless a powerful and striking
epic.</P>
<PRE>THE RATING (out of 5): * * * 1/2</PRE>
<P>You know it's often the case that while the majority of films keep you
occupied (hopefully even entertained!) for their duration, afterwards
you're often left with a feeling of indifference. A really good film should
have the ability to either stir your senses, engage your mind or touch your
heart. Every so often you come across a film like LEGENDS OF THE FALL, a
film which not only succeeds in doing the above, but also quite literally
punches you in the stomach! It's not a very pleasant sensation, but by
heck, it means the film-makers are doing something right!</P>
<P>LEGENDS OF THE FALL is a downbeat tale about three brothers, spanning the
American Indian Wars through the First World War and beyond. It's an epic
in the true sense of the world - spanning several years (and several hours
in real-time!). Director Edward Zwick does a masterful job coaxing terrific
performances from his all-star cast, and milking the beautifully location
scenery and passing events for all they're worth.</P>
<P>There are, however, some problems with the plotting. First of all, it's a
very grim tale - with not even a particularly happy ending, either. I can't
actually think of any real moment of happiness throughout the entire film -
there may be the odd glimmer, but I assure you it's a given that tragedy
will be lurking around the corner. There's also a rather tenuous connection
with the Native American Indians which isn't fully capitalised on. The
story is related by an Indian friend of the boy's father, One Stab, played
by Gordon Tootoosis. Other than that there seems little point to this plot
element other than glamour, which is a bit of a shame. There seems to be a
conscious attempt to somehow elevate the tale to almost "legend" status,
hence the title of the film. Sometimes it works, but generally it just
seems a bit superficial. It's a family drama, which occassionally veers
into melodrama, but is bolstered by the talent of its cast and director.
That's about it; I don't really buy into any deeper pretensions the film
may have about itself.</P>
<P>Kudos must be paid to the actors, who elevate a script which may have
otherwise descended into melodramatic hokum. Brad Pitt does a marvellous
job as the film's lead, the intense, disturbed Tristan. Pitt's performance
very effectively conveys a tortured soul, and with the focus primarily
resting on him as the film progresses, he carries the film nicely.
Unfortunately, Anthony Hopkins seems rather wasted as the father,
particularly as he spends half the film paralysed from a stroke and unable
to speak! But if he is only window dressing, then he's first class window
dressing at that! Julia Ormond also gives a strong performance as the
lovely Susannah, who finds herself torn between the brothers. Acting wise,
this is top of the range, and very often the performances elevate many a
scene from maudlin to emotionally poignant.</P>
<P>As I believe I mentioned above, director Zwick does a brilliant job
bringing to life a potentially tricky film. Whilst some lesser efforts
easily trip up when they try to do sweeping epics that span many years, for
the most part LEGENDS OF THE FALL flows effortlessly. The cinematography is
utterly beautiful, and the location work in the gorgeous hills of Montana
spectacular. Oh, and also to be highly commended is James Horner's
bombastic, majestic score - this guy knows how to score a film!</P>
<P>So, summing up then, a flawed but sufficient script is beautifully
performed and executed. It gets the thumbs up, but I would warn anything
thinking of watching it that it is certainly not feel-good viewing. It's a
grim and depressing tale, but brought to life by its magnificient acting,
directing and production values.</P>
