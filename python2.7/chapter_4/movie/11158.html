A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Todd Holland</PRE>
<P>Written by: Charlie Peters, from a novel by Frank Parkin</P>
<P>Starring: Richard Dreyfuss, Jenna Elfman, Lily Tomlin, Natasha Lyonne,
Gregory Smith, Carl Michael Lindner</P>
<PRE>Ingredients: 
Down-and out-professor, his kids, hoax about a lost tribe, jokes and
farcical situations</PRE>
<P>Synopsis: 
In this comedy Anthropology Professor James Krippendorf (Richard
Dreyfuss) is disheveled, down on his luck, and badly in debt. His wife
has died, his children barely acknowledge him, and the demoralized
professor has already squandered grant money which was earmarked for
research on an undiscovered New Guinea tribe. </P>
<P>When the day arrives when Krippendorf must give a speech on his research
on the lost tribe, instead of confessing that he has not found the
tribe, he tells a whopper. Fusing the names of his children (Shelly,
Mike, and Edmund), Krippendorf invents the 'Shelmikedmu' - - a
previously undiscovered New Guinea culture that lives in single-parent
homes. Shelmikedmu family units are supervised by the 'uta bagee' (Dad).
According to Krippendorf, the uta bagee must cook, clean, take care of a
dysfunctional family full of kids, romance new mates, and survive the
tribal version of divorce court.</P>
<P>The academic world is so intrigued by Krippendorf's tribe that soon they
pressure the professor for film footage. To keep the university and
creditors at bay Krippendorf and his kids soon find themselves creating
a studio in the backyard and wearing costumes in order to make fake film
footage. In the meantime, the fraud is also a good thing. After their
mother's death, the kids barely tolerated their father and each other.
But now the Krippendorf family is truly bonding.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, like the proverbial snowball rolling down a hill, the lie
keeps getting bigger and bigger. A skeptical academic rival (Lily
Tomlin) leaves for New Guinea determined to prove that the Shelmikedmu
don't exist. And when painted Shelmikedmu 'tribesmen' are spotted
running around in Krippendorf's backyard, it leads to guest spots on
talk shows for the 'chief 'of the tribe, an anthropology show on a cable
TV network, $100,000 in grant money, and the ever increasing possibility
that the hoax will be discovered. </P>
<P>How long can the hoax last before it all falls apart?</P>
<P>Opinion:
Pretending to be a lost tribe leads to several humorous situations. The
professor and his romantic interest Professor Veronica Micelli (Jenna
Elfman) get to grunt and run around in disguise wearing penis sheaths
and body paint. He gets Micelli drunk, seduces her, and fools her into
donning a tribal costume in order to film the fake mating ritual.  She
gets revenge by making him eat live insect grubs on a national talk show
when he is disguised as the 'uta bagee.' Meanwhile the kids invent the
Shelmikedmu circumcision rite, steal goats, and chase a chicken. A
monkey farts. And so on.</P>
<P>The character changes are not done well. We don't know whether Veronica
Micelli is supposed to be a shameless self-promoter or one of the good
guys, but I suspect her character was meant to evolve from one to the
other. Similarly, the kids' evolution from dysfunctional family to
functional family is not portrayed clearly, and Professor Krippendorf
doesn't change at all throughout the story. Probably the original
intention of the screenplay was to have Krippendorf come to be a better
father, the kids evolve into a better family, and Micelli go from
self-promoter to gal hero, but it didn't play out that way. Basically
everything takes a back seat to the gags.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if laughs are what you are after, KRIPPENDORF'S TRIBE
delivers a lot of gags, and keeps them coming at a consistent rate until
the end. As a PG-rated sex farce, KRIPPENDORF'S TRIBE is watchable and
keeps an upbeat tempo.</P>
