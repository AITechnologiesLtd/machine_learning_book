<P>     Here's something to chew on:  what's the favorite food of big, 
cheesy-looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the 
bowels of a luxury liner in DEEP RISING?  The obvious answer to this 
question is cardboard, because that's the depth of the most fully-
developed character in this painfully generic creature feature.  DEEP 
RISING demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something 
scripted by a computer.  In fact, considering the rigid adherence to the 
expected formulas, perhaps it was.</P>
<P>     The most astonishing thing about DEEP RISING is the exceptionally 
high level of gore.  Not since STARSHIP TROOPERS have this many chunks 
of flesh (both human and non-human) been scattered in all directions.  
We learn some bloody trivia, as well, such as how a sea monster 
spraypaints in red (it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied 
remains) and what it does with half-digested leftovers.  I suppose DEEP 
RISING's gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who 
love the macabre, but it doesn't do much for me.  </P>
<P>     On the surface, and that's about the only level at which this film 
can be analyzed, DEEP RISING feels like TREMORS grafted onto TITANIC 
(everyone else is citing the equally valid ALIENS/TITANIC connection, 
since James Cameron directed both).  In going for the big disaster angle 
of TITANIC and the tongue-in-cheek mayhem of TREMORS, DEEP RISING 
somehow misses both marks by a wide margin.  The film is not humorous, 
tense, or exciting.  In fact, it's downright boring, and, despite being 
half the length of Cameron's current box-office champ, DEEP RISING feels 
like the longer movie.</P>
<P>     Is it really necessary to say anything about the plot?  Probably 
not, since it's easy to guess, but I'll go ahead and oblige anyone who 
wants a synopsis.  The film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad 
guys on board a mercenary ship.  In addition to the usual cast of 
psychopaths and lunatics, there's Finnegan (Treat Williams), the boat's 
pilot, who's supposed to be an Indiana Jones knockoff; Joey (Kevin J. 
O'Connor), the inept sidekick who's supposed to be lovable and funny 
(but is really just irritating); and Hanover (Wes Studi), the 
"mastermind" (and I use that term lightly) of the operation.  Their 
goal:  attack a cruise ship, clean out the safe, then sink it using some 
illegally-acquired torpedoes.  The problem is, by the time they reach 
the Argonautica, the Titanic-like luxury liner has turned into the Marie 
Celeste.  Aside from a beautiful jewel thief (Famke Janssen) and a 
couple of crew members, there's no one on board.  The reason soon 
becomes obvious -- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect 
that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight 
tentacles.</P>
<P>     The cast, which is led by Treat Williams, is primarily comprised of 
has-beens and probably-never-will-bes (two exceptions: Wes Studi, best 
known as the villain in THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS, and Djimon Hounsou, 
AMISTAD's Cinque).  Williams, once a "can't miss" prospect in Hollywood, 
has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a 
lead role is a film like DEEP RISING, and his inability to create a 
charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his 
sputtering career.  Famke Janssen, who will forever be known as Xenia 
Onatopp from GOLDENEYE, is the perfect bland match for Williams.  Given 
her limited acting abilities, it's likely that she was chosen for this 
part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes.  Unfortunately, 
a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee-shirt for half of 
the picture.  Meanwhile, Kevin J. O'Connor, who has entirely too much 
screen time, exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a 
blackboard.</P>
<P>     These days, audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with 
computer-generated special effects.  This is a lesson that 
writer/director Stephen Sommers (who previously helmed the live-action 
JUNGLE BOOK) needs to learn.  The days of JURASSIC PARK, when viewers 
were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and 
imposing on screen, are past.  Now, movie-goers are looking for the 
sophistication of TITANIC -- visuals that are so well-incorporated that 
it's impossible to tell where they end and where "reality" begins.  In 
DEEP RISING, the monster, like everything, is artificial and 
unconvincing.  </P>
<P>     Unfortunately, the fundamental problem audiences are faced with 
here isn't so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture, but 
the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre (although, to be fair, 
DEEP RISING is a particularly bad entry).  Even once this film has sunk 
out of sight, the knowledgeable viewer knows it won't be the last of its 
kind.  Like the slimy, slithering things that inhabit the air vents and 
pipes of these movies, more are waiting just around the corner in 
ambush.  And that consideration, unlike anything on screen, is truly 
horrifying.</P>
