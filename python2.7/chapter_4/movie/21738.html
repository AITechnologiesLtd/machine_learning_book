<PRE>AMERICAN MOVIE</PRE>
<P>Got a serious appetite for life?  Prepare to gorge yourself on AMERICAN
MOVIE's all-u-can-eat buffet of reality.  This documentary's menu:
Destiny, Failure, Family, Friendship, and enough Humor to warrant
bringing a pack of Rolaids for that warm feeling that will invariably
creep up from your gut straight into your heart.</P>
<P>Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin – Mark Borchardt (himself) is a man possessed
by a desire to make movies, budget black & white horror flicks, to be
precise.  After facing the reality that his current project won't get
done before he gets funding, Mark shifts his focus to making money by
finishing his previous film.  Titled Coven, it's about a
substance-abusing writer whose spiral leads him to a self-help group
that is less than supportive.  As Borchardt struggles through continuous
and severe setbacks, the audience comes to understand and care deeply
about his passion.  He is so charismatic that there may be a temptation
to attribute the power of this story to his charm.  Greater than this,
however, is his tenacious determination at what he says is the critical
juncture in his voyage.  With the financial backing of his 82 year-old
Uncle, seemingly inexhaustible loyalty of his friends and mother, and
(quite) a few beers, Mark's core of pure energy just might be enough to
fuel a victorious journey – it's certainly sufficient to infuse the
audience with inspiration.</P>
<P>Then there's Mike Schank (himself) – musician, (very) recently reformed
drug user, and source of some of the best laughs of the year.  Friends
with Mark since childhood, Mike is as true as they come.  He's the kind
of person who has somehow managed to hold on to that simple but profound
wisdom often attributed to children, that usually leaves us as soon as
we stop telling the truth all of the time.</P>
<P>In an odd sort of way, AMERICAN MOVIE gave me the same kind of
satisfaction that comes from really good down home cooking; neither
needs false pretense to make you happy.  In fact, it was so good, I'm
thinking about going back for seconds.</P>
