<PRE>C'era una volta il west (1969)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 74</PRE>
<P>"Once Upon a Time in the West" was the last of
director Sergio Leone's four 'spaghetti westerns'
from the 1960s.  The formula of the first three
films is repeated: excellent cinematography, with
frequent lingering close-ups.  There is much
violence, a notable score by Ennio Morricone,
and the pace is excruciatingly slow.  The major
characters are famous actors from America, but
otherwise the cast and crew are Italian.</P>
<P>The story has crippled magnate Morton (Gabriele
Ferzetti) building a railroad across the West.
Standing in his path is stubborn, hot-headed McBain
(Frank Wolff) who has built land needed by the
railroad.  Morton sends brutal killer Frank
(Henry Fonda) to take care of McBain, but his widow
(Claudia Cardinale) inherits the property.  She
is protected by two other killers; reflective
outlaw Cheyenne (Jason Robards) and mysterious
loner Harmonica (Charles Bronson).</P>
<P>Leone's first three big budget westerns featured
Clint Eastwood.  There was a role for him in
"Once Upon a Time in the West" as well, but he
turned it down.  The role went to Bronson, who
is as tough as Eastwood but not as cool.  Fonda's
murderous character came as a shock to those
used to seeing him in benevolent "Mister Roberts"
roles (supposedly John Wayne had turned down the
part).</P>
<P>This is not, as many claim, Leone's best film.
"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" is certainly
better, and better still is "Once Upon a Time
in America".  One can blame the slow pace, but
the other films were slow as well.  Perhaps the
problem is that Fonda's and Bronson's characters
don't seem quite human.</P>
<P>The story is deliberately muddled as well, with
actions taking place long before they are adequately
explained.  I'm still wondering whether Morton dies;
perhaps he was shot by Cheyenne, or perhaps he
crawled out of the train to avoid being shot by
Frank.  Also, if Cheyenne was stopped from reaching
Yuma by his men (the only plausible explanation),
how would they have known to intercept him?</P>
<P>Still, "Once Upon a Time in the West" is a very
good western. It was undeservedly ignored by
the Academy Awards, who should have at least
nominated the film for the sets and cinematography.</P>
