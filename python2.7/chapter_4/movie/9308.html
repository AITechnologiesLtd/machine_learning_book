<PRE>A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by:
Jean-Jacques Annaud</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: 
screen writer Becky Johnston
based on the book by Heinrich Harrer</PRE>
<P>Starring: 
Brad Pitt, David Thewlis, Jamyan Jamtsho Wangchuk, Sonam Wangchuck,
Tenzin Wangchuk, and Jetsun Pema</P>
<P>Ingredients: Austrian mountaineer, Dalai Lama, mountains</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
Rich Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer (Brad Pitt) gets sidetracked
when World War II interrupts his mission to climb Nanga Parbat, a
Himalayan peak that in 1939 has never been successfully scaled. Trying
to get back to Europe, Harrer and climbing teammate Peter Aufschnaiter
(David Thewlis) get stranded in Tibet, where they settle down, and
Harrer becomes the tutor of the bright-eyed young Dalai Lama. (The Dalai
Lama is the spiritual and political leader of Tibet). Harrer reluctantly
leaves Tibet when Chinese forces under Mao conquer the tiny mountain
country.</P>
<P>Trivia:
Jetsun Pema, the woman who plays the Dalai Lamas mother in the movie,
is actually the real life Dalai Lamas sister. In real life she takes
care of Tibetan refugee children living in India and her organization
has educated over 40,000 children. </P>
<P>The movie is based on the true memoirs of Austrian mountaineer Heinrich
Harrer, who is still alive today at age 84. Harrer was a Nazi in the
1930s, and Germany's Stern magazine published a photo of Harrer
hobnobbing with Adolf Hitler.</P>
<P>Director Jean-Jacques Annaud is presently banned from entering China.
The movie was filmed mostly in the Andes mountains in South America.</P>
<P>Opinion:
Director Jean-Jacques Annaud directed two previous movies about a person
being modified by contact with another culture (Quest for Fire and
The Lover), so with Seven Years in Tibet, he was probably aiming for
a movie where a brash jerk runs away from his home country and comes
into contact with Tibet and slowly changes into a spiritual human being
until finally hes ready to return. Annaud wanted to show the mountain
climber learning to climb his own spiritual mountain, and symbolically
he tries to show this by having Heinrich Harrers clothes change from
riches to poor rags and slowly back to riches again. This doesnt quite
satisfy.  Usually in movies, when a character undergoes a change of
heart, they demonstrate their newfound character by doing an action or
making a difficult choice that they wouldnt have made under their old
personalities. In Annauds movie, the hero makes no such difficult
decision or actions. He wanders around Tibet, changes clothes a lot, and
then leaves when the Chinese take over and the Dalai Lama advises him to
leave. This lack of tough choices gives the movie only postcard depth,
like "I went to Tibet, I had a lot of bad luck, ran out of options, and
went back home to my responsibilities." Postcards arent bad though; the
scenery is breathtaking, even if it was shot in the Andes mountains
versus  the real Himalayas. Having the Harrer character make one or two
tough choices that demonstrate his spiritual redemption would have given
this movie more punch.</P>
