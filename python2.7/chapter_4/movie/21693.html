<PRE>Rating: * * out of * * * * (* *½ out of * * * * * for Nzone)</PRE>
<P>Rated R for strong violence and gore, disturbing images and some language.</P>
<P>Starring: Denzel Washington, Angelina Jolie, Queen Latifah, Michael Rooker.</P>
<PRE>Running Time: 126 minutes.</PRE>
<P>There has been films in the recent past that have changed us forever. In
example 'Silence of the Lambs' is a classic or the movies, Seven scared up
box-office records and grossed 100m+. Now we have another thriller, one which
by the trailers looked like a scary and great thriller that actually turned out
to be a slow-moving character plotted thriller with holes galore and good
acting. It suffers mostly from it's lack of intensity and trying to make it's
characters stick out more than anything and at times you wonder why even care
about the killer? We have these such strong characters there really is no use
for those other people. Sadly you can't help but compare this
so-called-thriller to 'Kiss The Girls' which has so many strong likenesses that
it may as well be called Kiss The Girls 2: The Bone Collector. </P>
<P>The plot is very intruiging however: A cop (Denzel Washington) Lincoln Rhyme is
a homicide detective that does forensics on crime scenes. When trying to
investigate the murder of a police officer he is struck by a large piece of
something and crippled. After a series of murders start Amelia Donaghy is
called in to help with the investigation a regular street cop she is, Lincoln
must have her go to the scenes of the crimes and try and figure out what is
happening and what is going on. The killer is a clever one and leaves many
puzzle pieces to say at his crime scenes for the police to figure out what he
is doing. Amelia and Lincoln team up Amelia psychically, Lincoln by radio in
his bed and try to stop this killer before someone else dies....or before they
do.</P>
<P>Even it's clever idea of a movie cannot seem to get it through in this tired,
formulic and muddled thriller that seems more like a piece of trash than it
does of an original or entertaining movie. It does have some high points, it's
homicide scenes are well produced and the setting is also well done. The acting
in the movie isn't terribly above average but Angelina Jolie seems to save it
from being a total bust. The script is well-written with tons of shadowing that
you find out is there at the end naturally in a mystery like this. However
sometimes we see something and are left still after the credits role wondering
what that was or what it had to do with the story.</P>
<P>Some problems with this movie include the fact that all the good parts are in
the trailer for the movie itself which leaves it open to disappointment. The
plot itself is good but at times unbelievable and the movie itself becomes too
conventional and predictable and by the first hour I already guessed the
killer. The ending is another bad thing which to me goes way to fast and isn't
even really that suspenseful. Some of the acting in the movie is pencil thin
with miscasts galore. Michael Rooker as an annoying cop did a great job but was
severely miscast. Second of all I don't think Denzel Washington did what he
could with his role and was a little stale. Ed O'Neil and Angelina Jolie
probably gave the best performances in this two hour movie.</P>
<P>Sadly the film makers on this movie wasted Queen Latifah and it took itself way
too seriously. The Bone Collector disappointed me, from it's good plot line
that was wasted in the process to the ending that is confused, to the boring
parts that seem to go on and on and on. The Bone Collector isn't a horrible
movie, it isn't a good movie, it's just an OK movie that could have been so
much better had it added more suspense and some original ideas. There are
cliches galore along with predictability that you know was or is going to
happen. When you see The Bone Collector I suggest not to be too hyped up. Then
again that's just my opinion.</P>
