<P>Ordinary --or even extraordinary--standards, criteria and judgments 
cannot apply to documentaries, especially those on the Holocaust. The 
most valid and obvious thing one can say about "The Last Days" is 
that it belongs to that handful of life-and-death documents which are 
indispensable viewing by all humans.</P>
<P>Put it this way. Whenever I am asked to name my favorite movie, or my 
Best 10 or 100, I reply that I cannot do it unless it is a list of 
the 1,000 Best.  On the other hand, if all films were to disappear, 
except for a few  that could be saved, I would begin that very small 
list with "Night and Fog, " the 1955,  32-minute documentary on 
extermination camps. It was made by Alain Resnais who is French but 
not Jewish. And the most recent film in that to-be-rescued group 
would be "The Last Days."</P>
<P>It is about the Jews of Hungary, one of the largest groups in Europe. 
In the mid-1930s the population of that country was about 8.5 
million. The ruler (as Regent) was the pro-fascist, antisemitic 
Admiral (in a landlocked country!) Horty. In June 1941 Hungary joined 
the Axis war on the USSR. By then the country's population had 
increased through Hitler's "gifts," annexations of areas in 
neighboring lands, These also has Jewish populations.</P>
<P>Like the Jews of Germany, those of Hungary were and felt assimilated 
in every way. They co-existed well with their Gentile friends and 
neighbors, although, to their bewilderment, when persecution later 
came full force,  antisemitism often showed its hidden face, 
especially in provincial towns and rural areas.</P>
<P>By 1941 there were about 825,000 Jews in Hungary, many of them in 
Budapest. By and large they felt safe. After all, they were "true" 
Magyars! They had no knowledge of Nazi atrocities elsewhere. This 
"ignorance," though hard to believe today, was quite common among 
both Jews and Gentiles all over the world..</P>
<P>By the end of World War II,  620,000 Hungarian Jews had been 
exterminated. The horror began systematically when, on March 19 1944, 
Hitler, by now mistrustful of his ally, invaded  the country. As it 
is often said, although he did not admit -- even to himself-- that 
after the rout at Stalingrad the Germans had already lost the war, he 
was more hell-bent than ever on winning his war against the Jews and 
making the Final Solution really final.</P>
<P>The title "The Last Days" stands both for the last days of the war 
and the last days in the lives of Hungarian Jews. The film  focuses 
on five Shoah survivors, each of whom tells his/her story to the 
camera in something like a historical stream of conscioussness.  No 
interviewers are seen or heard. Nor is there the usual narrator. The 
survivors themselves (who, coming to America after the war created 
families, professions and occupations) are the ones who narrate their 
past in bits, pieces, scenes or sequences. They are also shown 
visiting, decades later, their old Hungarian haunts and the scenes of 
the  Nazi crimes.</P>
<P>Thie tragic tales are edited and blended superlatively well, in 
criss-cross fashion. Intercut are period, family, and other 
photographs,  as well as documentary footage  of the war, the camps, 
the killers and the killed. Much  of this was shot by German 
soldiers. Every sight and sound shakes you to your foundations.  A 
great deal of the footage is new or rare or recently discovered.</P>
<P>It is not possible for me to find the right words that would 
characterize the skill, effectiveness, lucidity, and emotions of the 
process. Adjectives such as "superb," "magnificent," or "astounding" 
imply esthetic or showmanship values, all of which make those terms 
inappropriate. The witnesses are tremendously moved and moving.</P>
<P>All five witnesses are most likable. Opening the film is Tom Lantos, 
the 10-times elected Congressman from California and the only 
Holocaust survivor in Congress. He often adds striking notes of black 
humor which reinforce the horrors. He is the only Budapester of the 
group, the son of patrician parents, both killed in camps. Highly 
educated, handsome, elegant and calmly eloquent, he points out that 
he would not be here today without Raoul Wallenberg, the heroic Swede 
who saved thousands of Hungarian Jews --and later vanished in Soviet 
hands. Mr. Lantos came to the United States in 1947 on a Hillel 
scholarship--with no money but with a big Hungarian salami which was 
confiscated by customs.</P>
<P>Without duplicating the film in writing one cannot describe or 
characterize each participant, especially since their own 
descriptions of facts, events, thoughts and feelings are stunning, 
rich in variety yet similar in pain. Each time I have seen this film 
something special has jumped out and struck me. At the latest 
screening one of those moments was a witness, recounting her low 
point in the camp, says "that's when I stopped talking to God." And 
every time I am dumbfounded by the matter-of-factness of a German, 
Hans Munch, head doctor of a camp where experiments were made on 
humans. This chill-making is balanced by the warm scene where a black 
G.I., now a doctor, is brought an astonishing gift, the legacy to him 
by a man he and other soldiers had liberated from slavery.</P>
<P>The witnesses were all teen-agers then. They grew up fast, and grew 
older with admirable faith, in their beliefs,  and in the positive 
side of humanity.</P>
<P>There is more suspense in the film than in fictional thrillers, 
stunning absurdism and surrealism (among the Nazis), a depth of 
feeling and pain  that no fictional melodrama can approach. One can 
hardly think of 88 screen minutes as packed as these.</P>
<P>Director Moll and co-producer Beallor had previously made for TV the 
prize-winning "Survivors of the Holocaust" and "The Lost Children of 
Berlin." They bring hearts, minds and expertise to "The Last Days" 
which won the Oscar for Best Documentary.</P>
<P>It also has won the highest possible ratings from all film critics, 
more praise than for any film I can remember in the last many years.</P>
