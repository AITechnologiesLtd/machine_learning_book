<PRE>                           DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS
                       A film review by Ralph Benner
                        Copyright 1996 Ralph Benner</PRE>
<P>     About an hour into Carl Franklin's black noir DEVIL IN A BLUE
DRESS, costume designer Sharen Davis appears to have discovered for
Denzel Washington a style that's not new but is rejuvenated and
welcomed:  in suspenders over a white sleeveless T-shirt, Washington
brings to what is usually a slob dress code a genuine smolder. His
beefy contours and conscious swagger feed the burn, as does his skin,
which viewed through Tak Fujimoto's sandy-colored photography sometimes
looks burnt-orange. In the late 60s and early 70s, there was great hope
in Billy Dee Williams to break through the barriers, and in a few
quarters he has -- if you accept the STAR WARS stuff -- but he never
really got to the promised land. Bad scripts and personal demons
notwithstanding, I think it's the superfly hair that prevented larger
contact: it was often too greasy or greasy-curly or cut so
exaggeratedly that his charisma took a nose dive; his slimy overdose
made you feel unclean. For some black beauties, ethnicity can be
stunning -- Lena Horne and Iman, for example, or when not reeking of
camp, Whitney Houston. But for bl concession is required, and it hasn't
hurt Denzel one bit. After all, thanks to his predominantly white
audience, he's a bona fide super star. It's worth noting that, in
looking over receipts, it's also the white breaders who kept turning
out for WAITING TO EXHALE long after blacks deserted the box office.
One of the discomforting ironies of this may be that whites are more
receptive than black men to the argument the movie was invecting.</P>
<P>     The majority of the black audience didn't show up for DEVIL IN A
BLUE DRESS, and not many others showed up, either. Despite good
reviews, the box office fizzle is both understandable -- it was
released during the Simpson fiasco -- and regrettable. The movie seems
tailored for Washington's comely appeal, and while it's there, it isn't
used to the extent most probably wish it had. As you're watching, you
flash on Lawrence Kasdan's BODY HEAT, a movie it doesn't take after
except in potential for sexuality; you prepare yourself for sizzle.
It's definitely set up for it: opening in the L.A. summer of 1948,
Washington's Easy, a W.W.II vet-unemployed machinist, needs some quick
cash to save his house from being foreclosed and he's asked by a
typical hood to hunt down Jennifer Beals' Daphne Monet, who has a
"predilection for jazz, pigs feet and black meat." When Easy first
meets Daphne, a chat about weapons commences and he asks her, "What do
you prefer to use as your weapon?" and she invites, "Why don't you
search me and find out?" Need I say more? I'm going to have to: finally
recovering from the imbecilic FLASHDANCE, Beals's handicap isn't only
that she doesn't bounce the mattress with Washington, she's also a
repellent mixture of Liza Minnelli out of NEW YORK, NEW YORK and Dixie
Carter; you start thinking maybe it's a blessing Washington doesn't bag
her. Her performance above complaint, yet she's not enough of a charge
for Washington; in a blue bath robe, holding a cigarette, her shoulders
drooping inward (is it the pads?), she's a great granddaughter to the
40s dames of the damned but the generational distance allows for a
different noirish tack: there's nothing hateful about her to love. (In
this movie, it's the whites you hate.)</P>
<P>     In most critics' estimation, Denzel Washington still seems to take
second place to Morgan Freeman as America's best black actor.  Where
Freeman's insistently subtle, a giant of modulation and technique,
Washington's a 5th of vigor -- a passionate dynamo. Since STREET SMART
and DRIVING MISS DAISY, Freeman's learned enormously that the camera
detects his notorious cool and he's re-channelled it so that it emits
its power in a subterranean way that sneaks up on you and before you
know it you're overwhelmed -- like in THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.
Washington has this knowledge about the camera almost instinctually --
he's virtually born to be unleashed on the screen. Without overdoing
it, Washington spills over the brim; he shakes things up because he's
excited about his love of acting, his love of the territory that is
movie acting. He's not sloppy or egotistical in commanding his realm,
as is the great bad Al Pacino; though he isn't the center of
PHILADELPHIA, his egalitarian brio makes him its real champion -- its
Black Knight. In DEVIL, he's hero, but not solely:  Easy would be an
obit without gold-toothed Mouse, played with warpy morals by Don
Cheadle. Washington's the matinee idol director Franklin wants him to
be -- and a generous one: Easy gives Coretta (Lisa Nicole Carson, a
double for TV's Jackee) what she's hankering for. Right now, no other
American actor -- black, white or any other color from the rainbow --
has all the ingredients to produce a new kind of alchemy on screen.
When he gets to act opposite a woman with equal star magnitude, someone
like Michelle Pfeiffer, the explosion should be magical -- a close
encounter of the most erotic kind.</P>
<P>     To keep the budget down, Franklin's economized on the atmospherics
-- though Gary Frutkoff's design is more than adequate. What isn't
satisfactory is the score by Elmer Bernstein, who's snoozing in the
orchestra pit, and the classic recordings -- including T-Bone Walker's
"Westside Baby," Jimmy Witherspoon's "Ain't Nobody's Business,"
Ellington's "HY-AH-SU" and "Maybe I Should Change My Ways," Lucienne
Boyer's "Parlez Moi D'Amour," Frank Loesser's "On a Slow Boat to
China," Thelonious Monk's "Round Midnight" -- don't quite get us deep
into the Zapata-smoked, jazzy, illegal club ambiance. Had the
selections been more carnal and rhythmic, they might have done a lot to
shore up the missing heat between Washington and Beals. Doing his own
adaptation from the Walter Mosley novel, Franklin keeps things moving
along rapidly. As the story and secrets unfold, he sticks to the plot
details, wasting little time in extracurriculars or in efforts to
outfox us, and just as we're wondering what's to become of Easy, who
has blood on his hands, the noiry summation is explicitly conveyed.
What's a little unsettling about the movie is the question raised at
the end about ratting on your friends.  Coincidental, what ricochets in
the mind are that recent infamous L.A.  trial and the brother of the
Unabomber. DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS -- a misnomer of a title -- is caught
in a time trap: it may not find its larger appreciating audience until
one of those murderers, who like Easy probably "laughed a long time"
about the verdict of events, finds his phantom killers. Let's hope
Washington maintains his self-respect by continuing to reject offers of
millions to play him. Being Easy, he can; being susceptible to
temptation, it won't be.</P>
