FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>In the last decade of its existence Soviet Union was
desperately trying to counter overwhelming Western efforts
on the propaganda front of Cold War. That effort, among
other things, consisted in the multitude of explicitly
anti-Soviet spy and action thrillers like RED DAWN or RAMBO
2, so Soviets had to produce novels, movies and television
shows that would give their side of the story. One of such
examples was 1984 mini-series TASS IS AUTHORISED TO
DECLARE..., aired on former Yugoslav television in mid
1980s. The series was boring as hell, but those viewers
patient enough to sit through it in its entirety were
rewarded with occasional hilarious moment or too. One of
them was the scene featuring KGB agent leisurely discussing
James Bond movies with his CIA counterpart and mentioning
FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. The author of this review is unaware
whether Soviet citizens in 1984 were able to watch that
particular film, but the citizens of former Yugoslavia were
not. That 1963 Bond film, second in the row, was
unofficially banned by former Yugoslav authorities not
because of anti-Soviet content, but because the part of the
plot takes place in former Yugoslavia, and the original
novel by Ian Fleming had painted quite unflattering picture
of Zagreb, then one of major cities of former federation.
Ironically, it was video distributor from Zagreb that
introduced the film to the audience only few years later.
It's quite a shame, because for many critics view FROM
RUSSIA WITH LOVE as the best Bond film.</P>
<P>The plot of the film begins when the anonymous head of
SPECTRE organisation authorises very complex plan that would
utilise Cold War rivalry between Britain and USSR. At first,
British secret agent James Bond (played by Sean Connery) is
sent to Istanbul in order to meet Tatiana Romanova (played
by Daniela Bianchi), young and beautiful deciphering clerk
in Soviet Consulate. Romanova is offering her services in
obtaining precious decoding device Lektor from the Consulate
in exchange for meeting with handsome British agent she had
allegedly fallen in love by watching his photos in KGB
files. Bond suspects a trap, and he is right, since
Romanova's actions have been actually directed by KGB
spymaster Rosa Klebb (played by Lotte Lenya). But Romanova
is deceived too, since her boss has just defected to SPECTRE
and the ultimate goal of the operation is to bring Lektor to
SPECTRE and kill Bond in the process.</P>
<P>One of the reasons why FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE happens to be
one of the most popular Bond films is the fact that it
remains the closest to the original vision of the character
creator Ian Fleming (who also got cameo role in the film).
In this film Bond doesn't have to save the world from evil
megalomaniacs and their underground armies. The story
revolves around rather minor Cold War skirmish, hardly
relevant in the general scheme of things, an episode that
could be inspired by Ian Fleming's real life adventures
during his career in British intelligence. The lack of
spectacle usually associated with Bond films is compensated
with the complex and intriguing, yet understandable plot.
Although the intrigue involves double deception, the
scriptwriters Johanna Harwood and Richard Maibum didn't left
audience in the dark - from the opening scenes viewers are
told about all major details of the conspiracy. That
provides additional suspense, because audience knows that
Bond is about to face the danger. Even if we are aware of
the unwritten rules that mandate Bond winning at the end of
the day, the film still remains interesting. Realism of the
film is underlined with scriptwriters' efforts to provide
some continuity to the series (unlike the rest of Bond
movies that usually start from scratch). Events of the
previous movie (DR. NO) are referenced, and Sylvia (played
by Eunice Grayson) is the only Bond girl who was
romantically involved with Bond in two separate Bond films.</P>
<P>Despite the higher dosage of realism, FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE
still follows the escapist formula of Bond movies. Bond
still gets it on with beautiful women and locations of
Istanbul are quite exotic (although Wales locations are poor
substitute for the coast of Istria, and Venice scenes are
even poorer example of blue screen techniques) and Bond
still flirts with Moneypenny. The action is not that
spectacular, except in the last scenes of the film (where
Bond uses some rather crude tools to deal with villains,
instead of his favourite gadgets), but the fight scene in
train is one of the best in the history of Bond films.
Finally, legendary Bond gadgets are introduced, as well as
their inventor, Major Boothroyd a.k.a. Q (played by recently
deceased Desmond Llewelyn). Another Bond movie ingredient -
cool opening titles - seem somewhat inferior compared with
the similar scenes in latter Bond films.</P>
<P>The acting is superb, as usual. Connery again proves that he
was born to play James Bond and that nobody could do it any
better. He is especially good in this film, where the script
his usual cockiness confronts with the realities of world
where even the heroes might lose a fight or two and let the
villains, at least for a while, to have the upper hand.
Connery's role is very good, but his partners also did a
very good job. Pedro Armendariz as his Istanbul sidekick
Karim Bey is especially interesting to watch, since he plays
the character who actually shares Bond's hedonism - we might
see Karim Bey as some kind of local James Bond. That role is
even more powerful when we consider that Armendariz shot
this film while being terminally ill. Daniela Bianchi,
Italian model and Miss Universe 1960, does more than decent,
actually very good job as Bond girl, at least for someone
who got the role on the basis of a good look. Robert Shaw as
villain is also impressive - Bond films rarely featured
truly psychopathic, yet efficient and realistic baddies like
this one. Another impressive villain is Lotte Lenya as
Klebb; she even manages to bring some interesting subtexts
to her role - I wonder why the makers of CELLULOID CLOSET
missed the scenes that feature Klebb and Romanova together.</P>
<P>Of course, those who like to nit-pick would find some flaws.
My major complaint is somewhat too romantic and rather
unrealistic portrayal of Gypsies and terribly fake
"catfight" in Gypsy camp. But, generally speaking, FROM
RUSSIA WITH LOVE should be praised as rarely intelligent,
yet still entertaining Bond film, one of the shiniest
examples of Bonds from golden Connery era. All those who
like to truly appreciate Bond phenomenon should watch it.</P>
