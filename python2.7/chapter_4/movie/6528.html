<P>     BREATHING ROOM, a low-budget feature film from first-time director 
Jon Sherman, is a rickety romantic comedy that, in trying to be offbeat, 
ends up being offputting.  This hopelessly contrived movie attempts to 
make all sorts of witty, insightful comments about the nature and 
development of sexual and romantic liaisons in modern America.  Alas, 
most of the supposedly clever dialogue turns out to be trite, and the 
characters are neither endearing nor particularly interesting.</P>
<P>     As we're told in the perfunctory voiceover that opens BREATHING 
ROOM, Kathy (Susan Floyd) and David (Dan Futterman) have an atypical 
relationship.  They can't stay together, but they can't stay apart.  In 
the two years since they first met, they've broken up and gotten back 
together five times.  Of course, they're complete opposites.  She's a 
career-oriented woman who likes to have an ordered life.  He's a 
layabout who can't stand "real" jobs and appreciates spontaneity.  He's 
also allergic to commitment -- he can say "I love you" in fifteen 
different languages, but the words get caught in his throat whenever he 
tries to express that sentiment in English.  </P>
<P>     Twenty minutes into BREATHING ROOM, Kathy and David are on the 
verge of another breakup.  To forestall this, they decide to spend four 
weeks apart -- the time between Thanksgiving and Christmas.  No 
conversations, no meetings (planned or chance), and no phone calls.  The 
idea is that, by the end of the period, they'll know whether they're 
really meant to be together, or whether they should separate for good.  </P>
<P>     One of the many problems with BREATHING ROOM is that it doesn't 
present us with likable or well-developed characters.  Kathy and David 
are flung up on the screen without much concern for how the audience 
will react to them.  They come across as extremely self-centered and 
distant, and I never accepted them or believed their glib dialogue.  
Obviously, Sherman and his co-writer, Tom Hughes, are fans of TV sit-
coms like SEINFELD and FRIENDS, because their characters speak with the 
rhythms of those shows.  Such repartee becomes taxing in a full-length 
motion picture.</P>
<P>     In fact, the entire movie has a TV-like feel to it.  It's 
artificial and clunky.  BREATHING ROOM doesn't offer much in the way of 
emotional appeal, either.  I found myself not caring whether Kathy and 
David resolve their differences.  With the exception of a couple of 
nicely-crafted scenes, their feelings come across as shallow and 
insincere.  The "big" emotional payoff at the end isn't rewarding 
because of an ineffective build-up.  Sherman has taken too many wrong 
turns by this point for one scene to redeem his entire movie.</P>
<P>     The first line in BREATHING ROOM is "Paris in the Springtime's got 
nothing on New York at Christmas."  In keeping with this statement, 
Sherman's film gives us an idealized vision of the United States' 
largest city.  It's a bright, sparkling fairytale land, decked out in 
Christmas lights and curiously absent of crowds.  This isn't the 
genuine, bustling metropolis of New York, so it's only fitting that the 
characters in BREATHING ROOM bear only a cursory resemblance to any 
Generation X-ers that inhabit the real world.</P>
<P>     Susan Floyd and Dan Futterman (Robin Williams' son in THE 
BIRDCAGE), both stage actors, do the best they can with the material, 
but it's a thankless job.  BREATHING ROOM's deep-rooted flaws have their 
origins in the script, and even the best actors couldn't have saved this 
project (although, admittedly, a little more chemistry might have made 
it seem less cold and remote).  As romantic comedies go, BREATHING ROOM 
is a sad and unappealing affair, and extremely unlikely to evoke the 
warm glow that even the most modest entry into the genre strives for.</P>
