<P>_The_Replacements_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)</P>
<P>        Going into _The_Replacements_, one knows exactly what one is
going to see: a team of misfit football players comically getting their
act together for the big game, during which they enjoy their moment of
glory.  And, indeed, the only real surprise of this comedy is just how
content director Howard Deutch and writer Vince McKewin is with strictly
following expectations, not serving up one single deviation from the
given formula.</P>
<P>        It's for that very reason that I wouldn't be surprised if
_The_Replacements_ became a substantial late-summer hit; everything about
it is calibrated just so for broad audience "satisfaction."  Consider,
first, the characters that make up the replacement squad for the
fictional Washington Sentinels.  There is Daniel Bateman (Jon Favreau), a
violence-prone cop who speaks in a growl--leading to lots of easy
physical gags involving his penchant for tackling.  There's Clifford
Franklin (Orlando Jones), the wisecracking black guy.  Not to be outdone
are the big, tough black guys (Faizon Love and Michael "Bear" Taliferro),
who butt heads with the token Asian (Ace Yonamine)--who also happens to
be as large as a sumo wrestler, paving the way for the obvious fat jokes.
 Rhys Ifans' placekicker Nigel is basically a replay of his popular
character in _Notting_Hill_, a scruffy, layabout Welshman.  But with all
these caricatures, there has to be a straight man, and here he's in the
form of a cliché--quarterback Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), who cannot
quite live down choking in the crucial final moments of his last college
game.</P>
<P>        Will Coach Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman) whip these boys into
shape?  Can Shane find redemption and deliver when put in a similarly
nailbiting situation?  Will there be a crucial injury before the last
game is through?  Should there be any doubt?  But before
_The_Replacements_ reaches its foregone conclusion, there is the expected
stream of hijinks.  The replacements get into a bar brawl with the
on-strike players.  Head cheerleader Annabelle (the warm and winning
Brooke Langton, who deserves more big-league roles) must preside over a
pep squad trained in a different type of spirit-raising--lapdancing. 
Clifford leads his teammates in a rousing electric slide to "I Will
Survive."  Yes, these set pieces are engaging enough to hold the
attention.  What they aren't, however, are original or distinctive enough
to hold long in the memory.</P>
<P>        Which is _The_Replacements_'s ultimate failing--the film is
competently done (though a few of the actors, namely Favreau, are
constricted by one-note roles), but there's nothing to distinguish it
from the pack of sports comedies and feel-good underdog stories.  Perhaps
that's exactly what the masses are asking for, but it's discouraging that
Deutch and his crew didn't even try to bring anything more to the tired
game.</P>
