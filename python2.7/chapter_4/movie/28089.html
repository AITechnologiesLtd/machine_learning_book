<PRE>Traffic 
a film review by Chad Polenz</PRE>
<PRE>WHAT IT'S ABOUT: </PRE>
<P>A top judge from Ohio is selected to be the new head of the DEA and learns 
the ropes of America's war on drugs while at the same time having to deal 
with the fact his  own daughter is an addict. Several other subplots 
intertwine with this story including a pair of detectives who have brought 
down a local drug dealer and need him to testify against an even bigger 
trafficker whose wife never knew what he REALLY did for a living. Also, a 
fearless Mexican police officer plays both sides of the law against each 
other while he unknowingly helps one drug lord wipe out the top rival. There 
is no one central plot to the film, just these three stories overlapping with 
dozens of supporting characters playing vital roles. </P>
<PRE>WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT IT: </PRE>
<P>Top-notch performances by the cast give the serious-as-a-heart attack story 
even more depth and credence. Direction by Steven Soderbergh is magnificent 
in successfully bringing all the characters and stories together combined 
with superb cinematography. Each subplot is shot in a unique way giving them 
their own mood and motif - quite a risky move for such a mainstream Hollywood 
movie. If "Traffic" isn't great for its powerful and relevant theme it at 
least works as an entertaining character drama reminiscent of Paul Thomas 
Anderson's style. </P>
<PRE>WHAT'S NOT SO GOOD ABOUT IT: </PRE>
<P>The notion of the nation's top drug czar the clueless father of a junkie is 
trite, forced and quite unbelievable at times. The message this film is 
trying to send comes across loud and clear, but usually it's subtle themes 
that make great movies truly great. Later, when we see Michael Douglas (the 
czar) driving through the ghettos looking for his daughter it's hard not to 
laugh at him. He's driving around in his Mercedes assuming that since he is 
in the bad part of town it's a guarantee that's where his daughter will be. </P>
<P>The subplot involving the two detectives and their key witness is utterly 
predictable and when the good housewife suddenly becomes the kingpin in her 
husband's absence it's also quite difficult to swallow. And the third-string 
plot about the Mexican cop is kind of confusing. </P>
<PRE>OVERALL CRITIQUE: </PRE>
<P>Soderbergh's direction is excellent but another draft of the screenplay would 
really have smoothed out the many bumps in the story. At least all the actors 
are excellent in their respective roles, making even the most hackneyed 
scenes come off as serious and realistic as they are intended. </P>
<P>This film could have been a masterpiece but the final cut can't balance the 
poignant theme with the need to cram in so many characters, so many 
storylines and a few too many typical Hollywood stunts and gimmicks. At least 
20 minutes could have been cut without sacrificing the story or the theme. </P>
<P>Have you ever read an in-depth article in Rolling Stone or the New York Times 
about the facts of this war? It's astonishing when you realize how much money 
is spent and how little progress has been made. So many people are in jail 
for such small drug offenses and so many upstanding members of the law 
enforcement community have died or suffered in one way or another doing 
something they have been told is such a noble, worthy cause. This film begs 
the question, "Is all this effort really worth it? Is this the best way to 
attack this problem?" </P>
<P>Still, "Traffic" earns high acclaim from me for its courage to tell such a 
condescending story about the war on drugs so well. This is one of those 
movies that really makes you think because it has such relevance to the world 
we live in - you may even recognize the characters and the scenarios from 
your own life. It's a movie you'll debate your friends and family about - and 
that's what it wants to do. </P>
<PRE>GRADE: A- </PRE>
