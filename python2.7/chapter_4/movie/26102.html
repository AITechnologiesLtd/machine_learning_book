<P>Ever seen 1998's "Rush Hour?" How about 1999's "Blue Streak?" Do these two 
films have anything in common with "Bait," the new action-comedy directed by 
Antoine Fuqua (1998's Chow Yun-Fat/Mira Sorvino-starrer, "The Replacement 
Killers")? Well, aside from all three being released the same exact weekend 
of each progressive year, they also star an African-American comedian in a 
plot dealing with characters out to steal, or get, money. "Bait," more than 
either of its still-cliched predecessors, is a complete hack job, bankrupt of 
original ideas and likable characters. Fuqua's one attempt at distinguishing 
his picture from the rest of the generic lot is his intentionally choppy and 
quick-paced cinematography, equipped with extreme close-up shots of the 
actors' faces and the action happening onscreen. Not only is this camerawork 
annoying, however, but director Oliver Stone is far superior at the same 
thing, and usually has a point to make along with his stylistic choices.</P>
<P>Alvin Sanders (Jamie Foxx) is a well-meaning small-time thief who, at the 
start of the film, has just been arrested once again for the theft of a bunch 
of prawns--extra large shrimp--in a seafood house. He is put into jail with a 
cellmate in the form of John Jaster (Robert Pastorelli), an ill man who was 
forced into helping the technologically brilliant and psychotic Bristol (Doug 
Hutchison) attempt a grand-scale robbery of gold equaling up to $40-million 
in currency. Before long, Jaster meets an unfortunate demise, and the U.S. 
Treasury investigator on the case, Clenteen (David Morse), suspects that 
Alvin must know more than he is letting on. Unbeknownst to Alvin, he is 
decided to become the bait of the still-at-large Bristol by having a tracking 
device cleverly placed within his jaw, and set free.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Bristol malevolently decides that Alvin is the only living person 
who may know where the missing gold that was taken by Jaster is hiding, and 
sets out to not only stalk him, but threaten his girlfriend Lisa (Kimberly 
Elise) and 2-year-old son, the latter whom he has only just now discovered.</P>
<P>While never an inherently terrible movie, "Bait" digs itself a deep grave 
early on, simply by its own sheer mediocrity in every aspect. Aside from, 
perhaps, the charming appeal of Jamie Foxx (who otherwise deserves to not be 
wasting his time with such superfluous material), nothing stands out as being 
anything other than marginally tolerable, and more often than not is strictly 
of the "been-there/done-that" variety.</P>
<P>An obviously talented actor who shined in 1997's "Booty Call" and 1999's "Any 
Given Sunday," "Bait" is below the intelligence level of Jamie Foxx, and his 
character (an unlucky, often goofy guy struggling to put his life back 
together) a strict rehash of roles Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence, and Eddie 
Murphy have played in the past. In the supporting cast arena, Kimberly Elise 
(1998's "Beloved") adds validity to the otherwise thankless part of Alvin's 
weary girlfriend Lisa, as does David Morse (1999's "Crazy in Alabama"), who 
resembles an older Russell Crowe. Finally, Doug Hutchison (1999's "The Green 
Mile") appears as the overly nasty and severe Bristol; Robert Pastorelli 
(1996's "Michael") serviceably plays the conflicted robbery accomplice, 
Jaster; and Jamie Kennedy (1996's "Scream") tiresomely retreads the same 
character he has played in at least three other movies--the computer whiz 
working to track someone down.</P>
<P>The screenplay, by Andrew Scheinman, Adam Scheinman, and Tony Gilroy, is 
predictably sloppy and uninspired, not to mention entirely far-fetched. The 
idea of placing a tracking device in someone's chin is not only absurd for a 
mostly reality-based film, but also right out of a sci-fi picture starring 
Arnold Schwarzenegger. The attempts at comedy, too, fail the majority of the 
time and are forgettable. In fact, "Bait" as a whole is exactly the same 
way--aside from Foxx's fetching energy, there is nothing present that is even 
notably intriguing or worthwhile for any viewer, aside from die-hard action 
fanatics. All involved should have known better.</P>
