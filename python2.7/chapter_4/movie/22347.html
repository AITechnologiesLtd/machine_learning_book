<P>The fact that Full Metal Jacket, Stanley Kubrick's Vietnam War movie,
was filmed entirely on soundstages in England has been advertised by
many critics as if it were a quality of the film.  It certainly is a
different way of working out locations.  Full Metal Jacket abandons the
Oliver Stone war epic and opts for a clumsy string of ‘Nam vignettes.
Sadly, unique approaches cannot salvage a dead movie, which is what I
think Full Metal Jacket is.  Labeled the cinema's "master" by countless
film fans, historians, and filmmakers, Stanley Kubrick has made a few
masterpieces: 2001: A Space Odyssey, his galactic opera, and Dr.
Strangelove, his festival of Cold War caricatures.  These films were
brilliant because they discussed things that were valuable or poked fun
at certain issues in frightening ways.  Full Metal Jacket has been
hailed in many arenas as the definitive war film which surprises me
because the movie, a two-part epic wanna-be, and its isolated anecdotes,
though slightly amusing, are either war clichés or seemingly fabricated
horror shows of hilarity.  Is this what the Vietnam War was about?</P>
<P>Full Metal Jacket (the title refers to ammunition) seems to house two
short films.  Both have the film's central hero, a private nicknamed
Joker (Matthew Modine), but they seem unrelated.  The first segment of
the film depicts the horrors of basic training.  Several marine recruits
are at the South Carolina bootcamp which is dominated by the instructor
from hell, Sgt. Hartman (Lee Ermey).  He verbally and physically abuses
the men (he calls them "ladies" and "maggots"), shooting insanely rude
remarks like bullets, violating them, and forcing them to violate
themselves and their beliefs.  Hartman finds a pet victim in a heavy
klutz named Leonard or, as he is renamed, Gomer Pyle (Vincent
D'Onofrio).   While the film's focal point, Pvt. Joker, struggles to
help Pyle in this netherworld, the entire camp gets punished for every
frequent mistake Pyle makes.</P>
<P>This boot camp segment is nothing more than a march of characters as
empty of humanity as the caricatures in Strangelove.  Kubrick keeps
shoving his theme of dehumanization down our throats throughout the film
but, with dehumanization, there must be humanity first and this film's
characters are not of flesh and blood but are 2-D and, as far as I'm
concerned, are corpses.  If we are supposed to sympathize with these men
who are quickly being molded and brainwashed into becoming killing
machines, we must know and witness that they have human qualities that
are worth saving from this corruption.  The strange thing is that all
the time America thought it was going to help Vietnam purge itself of
Communism, it was contaminating its own people by replacing their souls
with robotic, murderous ones.</P>
<P>People say that Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio give searing
performances.  If they are supposed to show any range of emotion, they
have not done so.  Ermey's and D'Onofrio's may be the most interesting
characters in the entire movie, and the two play their monotone roles
with relative force, but there is nothing here but clown acts.  There is
not one streak of life in any of these characters, which is both
yawn-inducing and may mislead some to think this film is
thought-provoking stuff.  The first segment is a cartoon with that
sinister look of murder borrowed from Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.  It
is bitterly hilarious, but with little to say on the effects of war or
dehumanization.</P>
<P>The film's second segment cannot claim to be as entertaining.  At least
the first part of Full Metal Jacket was absorbing and we got a sense of
what the director was hinting at.  In the second portion, everything
falls apart.  Even the few building blocks on violence and terror that
the first part provided dissolve under the sheer lack of direction of
the film's message.  We meet up again with Pvt. Joker who is now a
journalist for the magazine Stars & Stripes.  He follows a platoon to
get their insights and becomes an unwilling part of a cat-and-mouse
showdown between a Vietnamese sniper and the quickly dying men in the
group.</P>
<P>There are some interesting scenes in this segment: one in which a
television crew slowly pans across soldier-infested grounds.  This scene
serves no purpose.  Another scene has the same crew interviewing men at
war.  The men are self-conscious in front of the camera and talk about
their ideas on Vietnam and the war they're fighting.  That scene too has
no purpose.</P>
<P>It is especially discouraging that the film's hero, Pvt. Joker, is
without motivation, evident interest, or insights into the war.  He just
seems to be a piece of garbage floating around in the wind.  All the
characters seem this way.  Full Metal Jacket is clueless: the Vietnamese
population is represented by two prostitutes who come around as easily
bought items for American soldiers.  The men bargain with the hookers'
managers and the prostitutes satisfy their low-paying customers.  The
only other significant Vietnamese character is the female sniper in the
climactic scene.  She is shot and Pvt. Joker must choose whether he
wants to put her out of her misery or let her lie there to rot.  She
yelps, "Shoot me" endlessly in this rather painful scene.</P>
<P>Kubrick's vision of Vietnam is a world of sameness.  I do not mock
Kubrick's desire to film Jacket on British soundstages for location is
of little importance with a good movie and a good production designer
waiting in the wings, but the film has a gross artificial aura.  We see
the same environment throughout the second half of the movie: the
imported palm trees, the constructed ruined buildings.  Kubrick has a
lack of vision for Full Metal Jacket, both visually and, worst of all,
thematically.  The director is a man of great passion for films and we
know he tried on this film.  However, rather than having the truth of
the stupidity of war float to the surface, he lets all truth sink to the
bottom.</P>
<P>There is nothing new to be learned from this movie.  The first segment
shifts to the next with such disregard for continuity that you're
positive the second part belongs to a totally different film.  People
will say that Kubrick leaves Full Metal Jacket open for discussion and
one's own opinions, but there is nothing here upon which to base
opinions.  Some of the movie is enjoyable but, as a moralistic tale,
Full Metal Jacket is unique, but puny and primitive.</P>
