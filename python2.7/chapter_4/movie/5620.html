<PRE>Review-  There was a scene in Welcome to the Dollhouse that 
shocked me into silence. It is when the main character makes
a speech to an auditorium of junior high students, and they 
all start teasing her in unison. The same exact thing       
happened to me in high school. It is filmed with such       
stunning in your face realism it brought back the same exact
feelings I had when it happened to me. The whole movie is   
like that.                                                  </PRE>
<P>Heather Matarazzo stars as a Junior High student with the   
unfortunate name of Dawn Weiner. She is more than just a    
little awkward in her appearance. her brother is a computer 
geek who seemingly only does anything because "it'll look   
good on my college transcripts." Her sister is a ballerina  
who sleeps with her dolls and spends much of the movie      
dancing around in the front yard. Her parents undoubtedly   
favor the other two children over her. Life isn't going very
well for her to say the least.                              </P>
<P>Two people enter her life, which starts causing some        
turmoil. One of them is the lead singer of her brother's    
band, a hunky rebellious type who Dawn is instantly         
attracted to. There is a hilarious scene where she fills him
up with junk food trying to get him to stay at her house    
longer. The other guy that enters her life is Brandon, a    
popular classmate of Dawn's who is very cruel to her. There 
are some very interesting twists involving his character,   
perfectly played by Brendan Sexton Jr.                      </P>
<PRE>First time writer-director Todd Solondz makes a stunning    
debut. He gives you scenes of unrelenting realism and angst,
then cuts to outright humor, only to stun you with angst    
once again. Heather Matarazzo delivers an amazing           
performance. She is a true discovery, able to perfectly     
capture the awkwardness and pain of her character. It is a  
masterful portrayal. I drove 3 hours to see Welcome to the  
Dollhouse, and it was well worth it. It is the first truly  
great movie of the year.                                    </PRE>
<PRE>****- Terrific                                              
***- Good                                                   
**- Below Par                                               
*- Very Bad                                                 
NO Stars- Avoid at all costs.                               </PRE>
