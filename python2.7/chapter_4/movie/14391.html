<PRE>                   RATING: **** (out of a possible *****)</PRE>
<P>        True genius must be a hard thing to live with.  "Good Will
Hunting," the latest film from director Gus Van Sant (Drugstore
Cowboy), explores this concept through the eyes of a twenty year-old
who happens to be a mental giant, and is filled with self-loathing
because of it.</P>
<P>        Matt Damon is Will Hunting, a brilliant young man with
absolutely no ambition whatsoever.  He surrounds himself with losers,
a grungy ratpack which includes his best friend Chuckie (an engaging
Ben Affleck).  Most of the group's evenings are spent getting drunk
and/or looking for fights, two activities they never seem to grow
tired of.</P>
<P>        But there's more to Will than initially meets the eye.  Able
to flip through books at the rate of a page per second yet still
retain everything he reads, Will possesses the intellectual
equivalent of several college degrees, despite being a high-school
dropout.  His quick mind deconstructs even the most complex
mathematics into laughably simply equations, making him the envy of
every scholar he meets.</P>
<P>        This includes Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard), an M.I.T.
professor who is the first to recognize Will's extraordinary
potential.  After Will easily solves an equation that has baffled
even Lambeau's most brilliant students, the professor comes to a
staggering conclusion: M.I.T. harbors one of the sharpest
mathematical minds the world has ever known... as its janitor.</P>
<P>        Yes, a janitor, for that is the extent of Will's ambition.
He walks around campus, emptying trashcans, mopping floors... and
solving the math problems Lambeau leaves lying around, simply because
he can.  By the time Lambeau realises what's going on, Will is in
jail, arrested once again for fighting.  The judge, who knows Will's
troubled past, does not wish to send him back to the streets, but
Lambeau intercedes.  If the judge is willing to release Will into
his custody, Lambeau promises he will find counseling for the boy,
plus keep him occupied with math-related work, which will hopefully
keep him too busy to get into more trouble.</P>
<P>        The math part is easy.  Finding a counselor willing to spend
more than ten minutes in the same room with Will, however, proves to
be a major challenge.  So clever is Will that he sees through every
psychiatric trick anyone tries to pull on him.  Desperate, Lambeau
calls in his old college roomate and arch-rival, Sean McGuire (Robin
Williams).  From this point on, the story focuses on the complex
relationship which develops between Sean and Will, with each man
determined to wear the other down, and neither willing to give up on
this goal.</P>
<P>        Robin Williams has never been better.  His performance as
Sean is so intense that the word "brilliant" simply doesn't do it
justice.  Of particular note is the tear-jerking monologue (performed
in a single unbroken take) that Sean recites to Will while the two
are sitting in a local park, experiencing what Will calls "a Taster's
Choice moment for guys."  This speech ranks right up there with
cinema's very finest.  Mr. Williams deservedly brought home the 1997
Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his work here; even if
the rest of the film had been horrible, this scene alone is powerful
enough to justify his nomination.</P>
<P>        Matt Damon is also very good.  He plays Will as an insecure
young man frightened by his potential; while not really malicious,
Will is slow to trust others, and automatically pushes people away
when they begin to get too close to him.  We see this in his
relationship with Skylar (Minnie Driver), a British student who falls
in love with him.  Their tumultuous romance forms one of the film's
emotional cornerstones, as well as providing the setup for the
story's bittersweet yet satisfying conclusion.</P>
<P>        "Good Will Hunting" is an emotional tour de force, running
the gauntlet from hilarity ("Do you like apples?") to heartache.
The script, written by stars Damon and Affleck, is smart and rich,
as are all the performances.  Never boring or uninvolving, the film
brings us deep into the world of a largely unsympathetic character
and makes him a "real" person.  Even as we recoil in horror at the
way Will treats Skylar, we understand *why* he acts the way he does.
His pain runs very deep; while that does not neccessarily excuse
his behavior, it does explain it.</P>
<P>        I read somewhere that Damon and Affleck's original idea for
the script was closer to James Bond: they wanted to write an
espionage/action film, with Will using his mental abilities to solve
a mystery while "bad guys" try to kill him.  Fortunately for us,
screenplays have a way of evolving into their own thing.  "Good Will
Hunting" is sweet, funny, touching, memorable, and the furthest
thing in the world from a ho-hum action movie.  It was one of my
favorite films of 1997.</P>
