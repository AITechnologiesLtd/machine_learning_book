<PRE>                  FRIDAY THE 13TH and FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 2
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>Friday the 13th (1980) * out of ***** - Cast: Betsy Palmer, Adrienne King,
Kevin Bacon. Directed by: Sean S. Cunningham. Running Time: 95 minutes.</P>
<P>The first film in a ridiculously long movie series about a crazed (almost
supernatural) killer in a hockey mask named Jason. Jason stalks Camp Crystal
Lake, killing naughty teens. Many people don't remember that in this, the
first installment, Jason wasn't the killer. He was merely a young camper who
had supposedly drowned while the camp's counselors were off having sex, and
now his mother was killing all the counselors at Camp Crystal Lake for
revenge. Dull, even by cheesy slasher-movie standards. Those who criticize
horror films as being sexist towards women should note that the lone
survivor of the film is a woman. Kevin Bacon, in one of his earliest roles
which I assume he'd like to forget, plays one of the counselors. [R]</P>

<P>Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981) * out of ***** - Cast: Betsy Palmer, Adrienne
King. Directed by: Steve Miner. Running Time: 87 minutes.</P>
<P>The second film isn't as ridiculous as most probably think, but it's just as
dull and padded as the first one. Five years after the events of part 1
(although only one year in real time... so technically it's 1985), Jason
(who isn't superhuman yet, just a demented man living in the woods) journeys
to the suburbs to kill the only survivor of part 1. Then, a group of kids go
through counselor training (translation: have sex) at a camp right next door
to Camp Crystal Lake. Soon, they are getting picked off one by one. Again,
the lone survivor is a woman, but the ending doesn't make any sense. The
heroine thinks she's safe with her boyfriend, until Jason explodes through
her window and takes her. A flash of white, and then we see paramedics
taking her away. She asks what happened to her boyfriend, and the film ends.
Hmmm. Jason has not acquired his hockey mask yet, so he wears a cloth sack
on his head. [R]</P>
