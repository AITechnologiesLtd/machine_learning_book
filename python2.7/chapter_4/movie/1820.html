<PRE>                     BLADE RUNNER: THE DIRECTOR'S CUT
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1993 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>2:05, R, Science Fiction/Action/Cult, 1992 (BLADE RUNNER was
first released in 1982)
Director: Ridley Scott
Cast: Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Daryl Hannah,
      Edward James Olmos, Joanna Cassidy, Brion James, M. Emmet Walsh,
      William Sanderson, Joe Turkel, James Hong</P>
<P>     Harrison Ford is a hired Replicant hunter, who is forced out of
retirement by M. Emmet Walsh to find four escaped Replicants, robots
that look like humans and have artificial intelligence.  The replicants
have a life span of four years and their leader Rutger Hauer is trying
to find a way to make them live longer.</P>
<P>     BLADE RUNNER: THE DIRECTOR'S CUT is better than the original.
Harrison Ford's annoying voice-overs have been removed and some of the
scenes have been rearranged.  I recommend this film to fans of the
original BLADE RUNNER.  Those who disliked BLADE RUNNER will probably
not like BLADE RUNNER: THE DIRECTOR'S CUT.  BLADE RUNNER: THE
DIRECTOR'S CUT will probably have a greater impact if seen in the
theater.  The flying scenes will also be more dramatic in the theater.
On a scale of zero to five, I give BLADE RUNNER: THE DIRECTOR'S CUT a
five.  BLADE RUNNER: THE DIRECTOR'S CUT is rated R for female nudity,
adult situations, explicit language, and graphic violence.</P>
<P>     Ridley Scott (ALIEN, BLACK RAIN) has created a dark and dreary
film that will certainly not be liked by all people.  The original
version has become a cult film.  All of the cult fans of the original
version should also enjoy this version.  The film is very well written
and held my interest throughout.  There aren't many science fiction
films that I can watch the number of times that I have this one.  The
sets used for this film are excellent, however I think that someone
went overboard with the Coca-Cola name placement.</P>
<P>     Harrison Ford (PATRIOT GAMES, INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE)
is great in his role.  This film is another example of why Harrison
Ford became the star that he now is.  Daryl Hannah (MEMOIRS OF AN
INVISIBLE MAN, SUMMER LOVERS) wasn't a big name star when this film
originally was released.  She is quite spectacular in her role as one
of the Replicants.  Rutger Hauer (BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, FLESH +
BLOOD) is excellent.  He can make quite a sinister person.  Sean Young
(NO WAY OUT, SKETCH ARTIST) is good as the Replicant that Harrison Ford
falls in love with, although out of the cast, I think that she was the
weakest actress.  Brion James (ANOTHER 48 HRS., TANGO & CASH) does a
good job in his short role as a Replicant.  M. Emmet Walsh (MISSING IN
ACTION, RED SCORPION), as per his usual, does a great job with his
role.  I think Joanna Cassidy (DON'T TELL MOM THE BABYSITTER'S DEAD,
MAY WINE) was also a rather weak actress in this film.</P>
