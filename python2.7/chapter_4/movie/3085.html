<P>     The career aspirations of Mathilda (Natalie Portman) aren't those
of the average twelve-year old girl.  Instead of wanting to be a doctor,
fashion model, teacher, lawyer, or nuclear physicist, Mathilda has
decided to follow in the footsteps of her best friend, surrogate
father, and protector, Leon (Jean Reno).  The only problem is that Leon
is a "cleaner"--a professional hit man ("Cool" is her one-word
response when she learns this tidbit of information).</P>
<P>     Mathilda comes from a very dysfunctional family.  Her father is a
drug dealer, his wife (played by Ellen Greene in a wig and performance
that strongly recall images of LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS' Audrey) despises
her, and her half-sister enjoys beating her up.  Mathilda's chief
pleasure is hanging out in her New York City tenement building's
stairwell, smoking cigarettes.</P>
<P>     One day, a crooked cop (played with typical over-the-top
exuberance by Gary Oldman) decides to have Mathilda's whole family
exterminated.  When she arrives home to find them slaughtered, she goes
to Leon, who lives down the hall, for help.  Although he's at first
reluctant to open his door to her, once he does, she worms her way into
both his life and his heart.  And she's not some wide-eyed innocent;
her desire to learn about killing is fueled by the need to exact bloody
revenge for her little brother's murder (she could care less about the
other family members).</P>
<P>     In LA FEMME NIKITA, writer/director Luc Besson proved his
capability of putting as much octane and adrenaline into a thriller as
any American director while keeping his formula uniquely
non-Hollywood.  Much the same is true of THE PROFESSIONAL, which has
sequences to rival those of SPEED for white-knuckle excitement--not to
mention a plot that's equally as preposterous.</P>
<P>     The real strength of THE PROFESSIONAL, however, is the central
relationship between Mathilda and Leon.  Although not well-founded in
reality, these two characters mesh nicely.  Despite an occasional
low-key hint of sexual attraction, this is basically a father/daughter
or mentor/apprentice relationship.  There's nothing unique about a
young girl melting the heart of a hardened loner except the manner in
which Besson approaches the theme.</P>
<P>     Jean Reno, essentially reprising his "cleaner" role from NIKITA
(where he was called Victor), plays his character with a perpetual
deadpan (except when he lampoons John Wayne).  He does more with
mannerisms and body language than with facial expressions, and the
closer he is drawn to Mathilda, the more uncomfortable he appears.</P>
<P>     The less traditional role belongs to an impressive Natalie
Portman, yet another member of the highly-talented, recent group of
youthful actors.  Portman portrays a victim of society's ills, the
perfect example of innocence corrupted.  There are likely some viewers
who will be disturbed by Mathilda's predilection for profanity.</P>
<P>     Because of the non-American flavor brought to this film by Besson,
THE PROFESSIONAL is anything but typical fare.  It is stylish, darkly
humorous, and almost artsy in its approach to the genre.  Nevertheless,
it delivers what viewers want from any thriller:  lots of action.  With
some surprisingly strong character interaction, there's a lot to like
about this movie, at least for those willing to look beyond all the
bloodshed.</P>
<P>     At one point, Leon comments to an attentive Mathilda that "the
closer you get to being a pro, the closer you can get to the client."
Through the intimacy of the link forged by Besson with his audience,
there's no doubt that he's as much the consummate professional as his
implacable title character.</P>
