<P>A couple of years ago, I watched as a visibly uncomfortable Freddie 
Prinze Jr. was paraded in front of reporters like a prize steer 
during a promotional appearance in Hollywood. As the cameras flashed 
and the emcee pummeled him with a series of stunningly inane 
questions, the young actor looked desperate to get out of the room. 
The next day, I spoke with Prinze about the incident and he 
acknowledged that the experience was awful, adding, "To be honest, 
I'm still kind of learning how to do the celebrity stuff. It's not 
what I got into the business for. I understand that it's part of the 
job, but I'm not very good at it."</P>
<P>The British love story "Notting Hill" examines the pitfalls of fame 
and does a surprisingly good job at it. Regular readers know that I 
have little tolerance for most contemporary romantic comedies. 
Watching a glamorous couple meet cute, fall in love, scamper about 
while pop songs play in the background, fight over some contrived 
situation and, flung back together by ridiculous coincidence, make up 
just in time for one more song usually makes my skin crawl. but I 
surrendered to the charms of "Notting Hill." </P>
<P>The script, by "Four Weddings and a Funeral" writer Richard Curtis, 
follows the Romantic Comedy 101 formula religiously, but hits enough 
high notes to triumph over the clichés. What really makes this film 
special, though, is the exceptional work of Julia Roberts and Hugh 
Grant. </P>
<P>Before "Notting Hill," Hugh Grant consistently left me cold. His 
acting technique, a combination of excessive blinking, twitching and 
stammering, was disquieting, to say the least. It's hard to enjoy a 
man who appears to be in desperate need of nervous-tic medication. 
Thankfully, he tones down the mannerisms this time around. As William,
 the quiet owner of a small London bookstore, Grant creates an 
engaging character. Kind, but self-contained, he projects a sweet 
sadness as a man who, having lost at love, finds comfort by wrapping 
himself in a blanket of benign depression. William's safe little 
cocoon soon unravels when American movie star Anna Scott walks into 
his shop. </P>
<P>As Anna, Julia Roberts is a revelation. Radiant as always, Roberts 
also shows remarkable depth here, perhaps because of her familiarity 
with the circumstances. Like Roberts, Anna is a superstar whose mere 
presence creates a sensation. Accustomed to non-stop scrutiny, she 
has developed an elaborate veneer and an equally sensitive defensive 
system. When she detects betrayal, she is quick to strike out at the 
offender, as happens in one of the film's most arresting scenes. 
Because of Robert's wonderfully nuanced performance, I completely 
believed in Anna and empathized with her plight. How hard it must be 
to strive for success in the arts, only to find yourself caged in a 
zoo of celebrity that never closes.   </P>
<P>Roberts and Grant interact beautifully, gliding over the numerous 
bumps in the production. Curtis' script contains many sweet moments, 
surrounded by virtually every cliché in the book. I noted each 
formula situation, but instead of becoming irritated, I was content 
to let them roll by, knowing another treat was soon to come. Yes, 
William's gross-out roommate (Rhys Ifans) plays like a gimmick with 
legs, but Anna's nonplused reaction to him is so perfect. Yes, the 
camera needlessly emphasizes the gawkish appearance of William's 
working class extended family, but what an appealing family they are. </P>
<P>One contrivance I couldn't excuse was an extended scene at a press 
junket, where William must pretend to be a reporter to keep an 
appointment with Anna. After their conversation, he is swept into a 
series of one-on-one interviews with the other actors from her film. 
In the real world, junket security is air-tight, one-on-one 
interviews are rare and actors never, ever ask your opinion of their 
movie. In a story where dramatic credibility hinges on realistic 
portrayals of media-celebrity exchanges, the scene is just sloppy 
writing. To make matters worse, it goes on too long with too few 
laughs.</P>
<P>But enough carping. Better to think of the picturesque Notting Hill 
marketplace, or the delightful birthday dinner, or the striking 
passage-of-time shot showing William walking down the street as the 
seasons change around him, or the wonderful crane shot in the park, 
when the camera glides up into the night sky, adding a lyrical 
perspective to the couple below. And what a couple. Thanks to Hugh 
Grant and the luminous Julia Roberts, "Notting Hill" works, both as a 
love story and as a reminder that those figures ducking the paparazzi 
are just other people, as lost, foolish and essential as you and I. </P>
