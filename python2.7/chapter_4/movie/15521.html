<PRE>Elizabeth
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (Out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Modern cynical observers maintain that it's virtually impossible for a
virtuous person to enter politics and retain their morals. They say that the
backroom wheeling, dealing and backstabbing will corrupt anyone. Secrecy and
treachery in government are the norm according to the jaded.</P>
<P>As "Elizabeth" demonstrates, this is nothing new. But in the 16th century the
backstabbing was literal. If they were lucky, political enemies were tossed
into prison without a trial. Others were beheaded or burned at the stake. How
long could a newcomer survive without making shady deals?</P>
<P>Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett), daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, is living
in the country at her step-parents' house as her half-sister Queen ("Bloody
Mary") Mary (Kathy Bates) rules England. Elizabeth is a delicate pale beauty
with ginger hair frolicking in the fields. Mary is an unpleasant crass monarch
lurking in the shadows while she burns heretics. It's not difficult to decide
who the film wants us to like.</P>
<P>In a Britain that is torn apart by religious wars, Catholic Mary is afraid of
Protestant Elizabeth but won't sign the execution orders. She has her thrown
in the Tower Of London. Elizabeth survives and when Mary dies in 1558, she is
crowned Queen of England </P>
<P>She is immediately faced with bad news. The army is in shambles; the treasury,
empty and they face danger from domestic and foreign enemies on every side.
Her court is filled with conspirators and there are very few people she can
believe. One trusted advisor, Sir William Cecil (Richard Attenborough) tells
her that she is in mortal danger until she produces an heir. Assassination
attempts prove him correct.</P>
<P>Cutting ties with Rome, she creates another powerful foe. The Pope release
English Catholics from allegiance to her and suggests that her death would be
a good thing for the church. A priest with that messages is dispatched to key
English families.</P>
<P>Pressured to marry either a French duke or Spanish king to forge political
alliances, Elizabeth shows that she is headstrong and refuses either. She
prefers the companionship of Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes). According to the
film, the Virgin Queen was certainly not one in the modern sense of the word.
Her bedroom scenes with Dudley demonstrate the hotblood that goes along with
her hothead.</P>
<P>Elizabeth's master spy Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush) does her dirty
work, eliminating foes by one means or another. Especially impressive is his
meeting with Mary of Guise (Fanny Ardant), the French Queen of Scotland, who
is amassing French troops on the English border.</P>
<P>The film looks great. As with other period dramas, the settings and costumes
are wondrous on the screen. A problem that I have with most such stories is
that it is difficult to tell what is fact and what is made up for the film.
There are historical inaccuracies here, but none that get in the way of the story.</P>
<P>Much of the movie's strength is in its actors. Blanchett is captivating as the
fragile young woman who grows into strength. Fiennes is adequate although
nothing special. Ardant is a breath of fresh air although she is given little
screen time. Although an enemy, she is the warmest character. Outstanding is
Rush as Elizabeth's icy enforcer. More of Walsingham's exploits would have
been appreciated.</P>
<P>The film's major flaw is that the numerous plots and maneuverings are
difficult to follow. Fifteen years of history are compressed into a couple. As
conspirators move in the shadows, many look alike and it would be difficult to
tell the players even with a scorecard. Although the general plot is
understandable, individual scenes are confusing. Without a strong background
in English history, it's often difficult to tell what is going on. After the
film was over, I understood what happened, but I wasn't sure exactly who did
what or even who was who.</P>
