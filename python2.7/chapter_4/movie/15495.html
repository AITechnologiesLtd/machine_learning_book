Written & Directed by Kore-eda Hirokazu

<P>It begins with a great hook.  Several men and a woman gather in a 
room, discussing their workload for the week to come.  Each is 
assigned several cases--people, presumably patients, maybe in a 
hospital, maybe in a mental institution.  But the workers discussing 
their cases wear ordinary clothes, and the building seems more school 
than hospital.  The people--patients, if that is what they are--are 
greeted in a reception room, and then directed to the person handling 
their "case."  Everyone is amiable and courteous.  The "case workers" 
lead their "patients" to a private room, sit them down at a desk, face 
them squarely.  They then inform them that they are dead, and in a few 
days they will pass on to another realm, beyond self-awareness.</P>
<P>So begins the second fiction feature by Japanese director Kore-eda 
Hirokazu, whose previous work, MABOROSI, was one of this decade's more 
impressive debuts.  But that movie, sublime as it was, is surpassed in 
all regards by AFTER LIFE.  MABOROSI was a strikingly beautiful film, 
but austere and formal: it required patience.  To appreciate it, you 
had to bear with it.  AFTER LIFE requires no such act of faith: it is 
warm, intimate, direct, and it is a masterpiece.</P>
<P>The building, then, is neither hospital nor school nor institute: it 
is limbo, the doorway to heaven, the threshold of nirvana, any or all 
of the above.  The men and the woman are not case workers, they are 
advisors, they will guide the dead on their final voyage.  Their task 
is simple enough to describe, but difficult to perform: they must help 
the dead choose a single memory, their most cherished memory, and when 
they have done so, they will pass on to a place where they will dwell 
in that memory forever, forgetting all else.  In a splendidly 
conceived literalization of this task--and a self-reflexive comment on 
the task that AFTER LIFE itself undertakes--the guides also have to 
stage a reenactment of each chosen memory, which will be filmed for 
posterity.  (This leads, amongst other things, to a clever scene 
staged like a pre-production meeting, in which they discuss how to 
recreate individual memories: clouds rushing by the cockpit of an 
airplane in flight; cherry blossom falling like snow.)</P>
<P>The dead--who look, talk, and act as they were just before they 
died--ask the kind of questions we might ask.  There is no heaven and 
hell?  No, there isn't.  Can they choose a dream instead of a memory, 
or a vision of the future instead of a recollection of the past?  No, 
they can't.  Once they have established the parameters, they begin to 
pan the rivers of memory, sifting the rocks and the sand and the mud, 
looking for the precious glint of gold, the single instant that sums 
up who they were.  The process is as much self-definition as 
recollection.  Much of this part of the film is done in "talking head" 
documentary-style interviews: the camera, fixed, faces the characters 
head-on, and lets them talk.  Nothing else is needed: listening to 
their reminiscences, feeling their emotions as they try to capture the 
essence of themselves in a single moment, provides all the drama and 
passion we could want.</P>
<P>There is an authenticity about these reminiscences that goes beyond 
fiction, beyond acting, that seems to capture something raw and true.  
I was not surprised to learn, after I had seen the film, that many of 
the cast members are non-professionals, real people recalling real 
lives.  They were selected from over five hundred interviewees, found 
more or less at random, in nursing homes and parks and temples in 
Tokyo.  What these people have done in this film is remarkable.  It is 
not acting, but its opposite: they have stripped away pretense and 
artifice, and bared their souls.</P>
<P>We learn much about them, but as they talk to their advisors, we also 
start to learn about the advisors, too.  There are many quiet 
revelations, each fitting perfectly into the overall scheme of the 
film.  We are treated to the details of the advisor's jobs, the 
logistics involved in the mock-up recreations, the formalities that 
provide a send-off for these people as they pass into easeful 
self-less sleep.  Some details are left deliberately obscure--we never 
learn how anyone died, we never learn the boundaries of this spiritual 
halfway house--but we eventually find out who the guides are, and why 
they do what they do.  The more I think about it, the more profound 
and reassuring that revelation seems.</P>
<P>The same can be said for the whole movie, but one sequence in 
particular affected me beyond all reason.  An older woman--who I am 
convinced is one of the non-professionals, remembering genuine lived 
experience--is describing her chosen memory.  She recalls dancing as a 
young girl to a song called "The Red Shoes."  As she talks, details 
return to her: the dance steps, her red dress, a gesture made with her 
handkerchief. There is nothing in my own experience that connects me 
with these things.  She is a woman; I am a man.  I have never been to 
her homeland; she, probably, has never been to mine.  I have never 
heard a song called "The Red Shoes," and I don't like dancing.</P>
<P>Yet this scene, this simple, unpoetic remembrance, moved me, 
inexplicably, to tears.  I can count on one hand the number of times I 
have felt so choked up by a single scene in a movie.  The only thing 
that this woman and I have in common is our humanity.  One of AFTER 
LIFE's many lessons is that, in the end, that is enough.  We are all 
bound by our mortality, and it is that bond which makes it bearable.</P>
