Reviewed October 17, 1998.</P>
<P>Although the original "Child's Play" was an intelligent, surprisingly 
well-crafted horror film, I have never been that big a fan of the 
series. I mean, it's hard to make a 3-foot doll scary, and by the time 
1991's "Child's Play 3" rolled around, the series felt pretty much dead 
and buried. But old slasher series' die hard, and since there has been a 
recent horror resurgence, it was inevitable that Chucky would indeed be 
back for a third sequel.</P>
<P>"Bride of Chucky" has a genuinely goofy premise, and is far more 
original than the other sequels. The film starts off with Tiffany 
(Jennifer Tilly), a bit of trailer-park trash, who gets ahold of the 
remains of the mostly destroyed Chucky doll, which holds the soul of her 
old boyfriend, Charles Lee Ray. She sews the parts back together and 
resurrects Chucky who, in exchange, murders Tiffany and transports her
 soul into a female doll. They realize that in order to get out of the 
doll bodies, they have to get a necklace that Charles is buried with in 
a small town in New Jersey. Through a series of circumstances, these two 
murderous, feuding dolls hitch a ride with a teenage couple, Jude 
(Katherine Heigl) and Jesse (Nick Stabile), who have run away to be 
together. Did you follow all that?</P>
<P>"Bride of Chucky" has one of the most absurd plots of the year, and some 
sequences are downright silly (a sex scene involving the Chucky and 
Tiffany dolls immediately springs to mind), but I have to admit that I 
do admire the filmmakers for trying something a little bit different, 
rather than recycling the same exact storyline for each sequel. In fact, 
the film is basically a "Chucky" road movie, which is actually quite 
intriguing, but it never really follows through with its aspirations. 
Just as in the recent, "Halloween: H20," the movie felt much too short, 
as if there was a rush to get to the ending. If another ten to fifteen 
minutes had been added to the running time, it would have been much more 
satisfying.</P>
<P>I must honestly admit, however, that there is a lot to like in the film. 
For one, the screenplay is far more sharply written than the other 
sequels in the series, and there are a lot of clever in-jokes and sharp 
lines of dialogue. The beginning, for example, is set in a building 
where all of history's killers' remains are locked up, and before we get 
to Chucky, the camera passes by a hockey mask and the Michael Myers 
mask. </P>
<P>Another element I liked in the film is the realistic love-hate 
relationship between Chucky and Tiffany. Even though they are dolls, 
they act exactly like humans do, and are always fighting, but still love 
each other. They are some very funny exchanges between the two 
throughout, particularly a conversation where they discuss Martha 
Stewart.</P>
<P>For being a third sequel in a reputable slasher series, it is amazing 
some of the talent they were able to get. Director Ronny Yu is 
highly-acclaimed in China, and this is his American debut. Tilly is 
almost always a wonderful actress (and has even been nominated for an 
Academy Award), and she brings a lot of energy to the first act of the 
film, when she is in human form. The cinematography by Peter Pau is 
richly textured and well-done.</P>
<P>But if you look at "Bride of Chucky" as a horror film, which it is, that 
is where the film fails. There is so much zaniness in the story and 
dialogue that it is not the least bit scary or suspenseful (except for 
one scene involving Tilly and Alexis Arquette, as her gothic boyfriend). 
The movie also never takes off the way it should, and although it was 
surely on its way to getting to that next plateau, it never made it 
because it was simply too abrupt. If you are looking for a scary horror 
film during this Halloween season, then my recommendation would be to 
see "Urban Legend," which is far, far better. Although the filmmakers 
wanted "Bride of Chucky" to be more along the lines of recent 
genre-bending horror flicks, such as "Scream," what they basically have 
made is yet another 80's slasher film. You know, the type that usually 
wouldn't even get grandma's ticker going. </P>
