<PRE>                                 THE FIRM
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<PRE>         [This is one of my golden oldies reviews - written years 
          ago when I was just getting started and never posted. 
          I stand by the conclusions, but in most cases many details 
          are missing that I would normally include today.]</PRE>
<PRE>     I am a BIG John Grisham fan.  He is the author of THE FIRM.  I
liked him so much that I ended up reading all 4 of his books while on
vacation in Hawaii in May.</PRE>
<P>     Now, I would give the firm 2 1/2 stars.  Only if you have NOT read
the book, would I recommend the movie; otherwise, I would say skip it.</P>
<P>     I found the movie simple and easy to follow.  I thought the
casting was just about perfect in that everyone in the show reminded me
of the characters from the book.  Although granted there were some
changes, I thought overall the movie was a good subset of the book.  I
thought the movie was well directed and edited.  The visuals and the
sound were nothing special but were okay.</P>
<P>     Now, why if I loved the book and I thought this was very similar
to the book would I give it only a so-so review? The reason the book
was so great was the suspense and the page-turner writing style.  After
reading the book, there were no surprises.  A big ho-hum.</P>
<P>     If you have not read the book, you might just love this show.  If
I had not read the book, I think it might have gotten as high as 3 to 3
1/2 stars from me.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
