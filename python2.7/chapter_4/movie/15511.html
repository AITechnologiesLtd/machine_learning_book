<PRE>PRACTICAL MAGIC
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Based on Alice Hoffman's novel, Practical Magic is a partially
enchanting film about the lives and loves of a family of witches.  The
film is never as magical as it needs to be, and it is harmed by some
overly simplistic solutions.</P>
<P>The Owens family is a family of witches...stubborn witches apparently.
For 300 years, their small Massachusetts town has persecuted and shunned
the Owens girls.  But, do they move away and start anew?  Nope.  They
don't even put a curse on the locals.  Instead, they live in the same
small town, and even suffer under a curse of their own.</P>
<P>You see, ever since one Owens girl was unlucky in love many many moons
ago, any man who ever loves an Owens is doomed to die young.  This curse
doesn't bother the flighty Gillian Owens (Nicole Kidman), who thinks
there are plenty of men around, so why should she get attached to just
one? However, for Sally Owens (Sandra Bullock), the curse presents a
problem... one she attempts to solve (but apparently unsuccessfully)
with magic.</P>
<P>Flash forward several years...a desperate plea from Gillian, whose
flighty ways have landed her in Florida, sends Sally on a rescue
attempt. Apparently Gillian's latest boyfriend, Jimmy (Goran Visnjic),
isn't a really nice guy.  But when the two witches start using magic to
get out of their predicament, they're unprepared for the dark forces
they are about to unleash.</P>
<P>For the most part, Practical Magic displays the light side of
witchcraft. There's one moderately gruesome spirit, but other than that,
the magic here is as tame as Bewitched.</P>
<P>Sandra Bullock is a bit bland as Sally.  She's likable, but her
character cries out for a magical zest which never materializes. Kidman
is a little better as the free spirited Gillian.  At least she
captivates your attention a little bit.  But both of the leads are a
little flat...too one note.  They both seem more like short descriptions
rather than full-fledged characters.</P>
<P>The supporting cast is a mixed bag of tricks. Stockard Channing and
Dianne Wiest seem to hit the right notes as Sally and Gillian's wise,
doting aunts.  But Aidan Quinn doesn't quite fit as a detective hot on
Jimmy's trail.  The townsfolk are amusing at times, but rarely
believable in their convictions.</P>
<P>Practical Magic is a nice enough movie, but, on the whole, it's
disappointing. Everything wraps up a bit too neatly, and the whole film
is missing a certain charm.  At best, it makes for a fluffy little
diversion.</P>
