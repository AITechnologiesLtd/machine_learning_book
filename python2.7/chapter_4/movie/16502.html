<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   The recent trend emerging from studio films arriving on the
   marketplace -- the repackaging of familiar, proven story material in
   a teen-friendly context -- is indicative of the degree to which this
   lucrative demographic is coveted.  Amy Heckerling's contemporary
   revision of Jane Austen's "Emma" provided one of 1995's most clever
   and buoyant pictures in the unexpected hit CLUELESS, and the recent
   Robert Rodriguez film THE FACULTY is simply a mishmash of THE
   INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, THE THING, and teenagers, but in the
   imminent future, the trickle of teen updates to date becomes a river:
   on the horizon include such fare as CRUEL INTENTIONS ("Les Liaisons
   Dangereuses" plus Buffy), TEN THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU ("The Taming Of
   The Shrew" in high school), and the U.S. release of STRIKE! (spunky
   teen starlets meet "Lysistrata", to woeful effect).</P>
<P>   Yet another example of teen-oriented revisionism run rampant is the
   relentlessly conventional SHE'S ALL THAT, re-teaming THE HOUSE OF YES
   castmates Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cook in an update of
   the Pygmalion tale squarely aimed at the teen crowd.  Put to film
   most memorably in MY FAIR LADY, this formula is hardly unpredictable
   -- man aims to transform "ugly duckling" to princess, with unexpected
   peripheral effects -- but what's disappointing here is the lack of
   any sort of effective fresh spin; after transplanting the fable into
   a trendy Southern California milieu, R. Lee Fleming Jr.'s screenplay
   slips into auto-pilot.</P>
<P>   That's especially crippling in this picture, far moreso than the
   scoffable inability of horn-rimmed glasses, a bad wig, a
   paint-splattered ensemble, and a tendency of tumbling to the ground
   to mask Ms. Cook's appeal while in wallflower mode -- after all,
   similar efforts to render the radiant Audrey Hepburn as gawky were
   also spectacularly unsuccessful.  It's crucial that a tale with such
   an obvious preordained conclusion should sustain interest along its
   familiar route, yet every twist and turn in the tedious plot unfolds
   like clockwork while punchlines and comic gags thud with unforgivable
   regularity.  Although the film ramps up a notch during its final
   half-hour, it's mostly due to the performances of its leads that the
   picture broaches tolerability.</P>
<P>   A few necessary amendments have been implemented onto the formula in
   order to make the story more palatable to contemporary attitudes.
   Today's audiences would have be challenged to find empathy for the
   passive, demure heroines which populate these tales; consequently,
   frumpy social outcast Laney (Cook) is no shrinking violet: she's much
   tougher, sharper and more self-assured -- not only does she refuse to
   swoon at the sudden attention from hotshot Zack (Prinze Jr.), she
   outright rejects his advances and freely fires acid zingers in his
   direction.  Far from being a reclamation project, the picture takes
   on the perspective that she's the film's strongest and most complete
   character from the outset.  (Of course, she's imbued with requisite
   vulnerability -- her unremitting seriousness and angry art indicate
   her loss of youthful vigor and buried grief upon her mom's death.
   And there is the matter of that wonderfully tacky falafel hat she
   gets to wear at her part-time job.)</P>
<P>   Otherwise, there's a numbing lack of innovation evident in this film.
   Racking up the clichis, the typical centerpiece makeover scene makes
   its inevitable appearance, with the "not improved, just different"
   Laney descending down the staircase accompanied by a sweet love song
   on the background as Zack gapes upwards agog (though I liked that the
   filmmakers undercut the moment with some humour).  It should be noted
   that Zack's moment of epiphany is a curious variant -- a
   time-honoured staple of these sorts of pictures is the magical
   reaction shot of the guy finally recognizing the beauty buried
   beneath the glasses and the bad hair; it's usually a fleeting moment
   which occurs when she removes her ungainly spectacles, but it occurs
   here when Laney slips out of her overalls to reveal her swimsuit-clad
   figure.</P>
<P>   While it may be futile to point out logical faults in what's
   essentially a contemporary fairytale, the film is so rife with holes
   that it would be overly charitable to neglect them altogether.  Zack
   is depicted as such a sensitive, kind-hearted soul that his initial
   pairing with such a cartoonishly one-dimensional villainess as Taylor
   (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) defies credibility (save, that is, for her
   physical attributes).  Frankly, he's such a flat-out nice guy that it
   becomes difficult to swallow someone so thoroughly genial could
   rocket up the cutthroat high school social ladder to the point where
   he lords over the student body, enforcing law and order with nary a
   bit of intimidation and having the soccer team at his beck and call.</P>
<P>   These are minor quibbles relative to Laney's behavioural
   inconsistency, leaping from incredulous (and warranted) suspicion of
   Zack's advances to reluctant acceptance of his courtship with little
   cohesion bridging the two positions.  (It feels like scenes are
   missing.)  And the velocity of perennial outcast Laney's acceptance
   into the In Crowd should give hope for social misfits everywhere.</P>
<P>   While the picture's focus is largely upon the budding romance between
   our class-mismatched couple, it indulges in occasional comic
   diversions (most of which crash and burn) and some brief flights of
   fancy, catapulting fully into the realm of full-fledged fantasy at
   the prom, where the seniors break out into an extended choreographed
   dance sequence.  It's a moment that's both energetic and fun to
   watch.</P>
<P>   Although SHE'S ALL THAT's plodding consistent vision is smartly
   softened by the genuine sincerity and affection with which it treats
   its love story, the roster of caricatures which serve as supporting
   characters is a drawback.  Among the peripheral players, which
   include a reunion of THE MIGHTY's Elden Henson and Kieran Culkin (as
   part of Laney's Outcast Brigade) and Anna Paquin (who turns in a
   bizarre interpretation of a teenager), only rubber-faced Matthew
   Lillard makes much of an impression as the comically narcissistic
   Brock.  (Not only does he sport a tattoo of himself on his bicep,
   it's also labelled "Me", lest any confusion arise.)  Brock's the sort
   of character who, on stage, would carry around a mirror to gaze
   adoringly at himself; appropriately, in the film he'd rather
   approvingly ogle his televised visage than cuddle with Taylor.</P>
<P>   The film's strength undoubtedly lies with the screen presence of its
   charismatic leads.  Mr. Prinze Jr. gives an easygoing, affable
   performance; his wide, disarming smile suggests that the hurtful
   cruelty inherent in the plot will be dulled.  Meanwhile, Ms. Cook
   continues to demonstrate her adeptness in front of the camera,
   navigating both her character's sullen and softer sides with ease.
   (She, along with Monica Keena, were the only bright spots in STRIKE!)
   Although her tiny, delicate frame and photogenic face is obscured by
   garish clothing and unsightly accessories for half the movie (and her
   first scene calls on her to hock up a loogie, natch), she's an
   instantly charming performer.  They deserved a better movie than
   this.</P>
