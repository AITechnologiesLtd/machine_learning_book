<P>" Southpark: Bigger, Longer, Uncut "  * * *</P>
<P>    Before it runs out of steam toward the end, SOUTHPARK (which
incidentally was cut to secure an R-rating) is the funniest film of the
year.  By default; there haven¹t been many comedies, and certainly none this
unabashedly obscene.  And, right from the start, you know you¹re in the
hands of a couple filmmakers with a keen sense of humor, as Kyle, Stan,
Cartman and Kenny head off to "a foreign film from Canada", via an hilarious
Disney rip-off show tune called "Mountain Town".  Iconoclasm in place;
politics are next.  The kids can¹t get into the new Terrance and Phillip
film, because it is R-rated (for good reason) and they¹re underage.  Tip, if
you find yourself in a similar predicament:  bribe the local bum, and no
movie or ratings restriction is unbeatable.  Good thing they get in, too, as
the incessantly profane five minutes we see next are a riot, full of as many
fart noises and ŒF¹ words as I¹ve seen in that short a time.  Then comes the
hook:  Comedy Central can¹t run "Southpark" in all its glory.  So, once the
boys leave their three-hour marathon of more bad language than they know
what to do with, BIGGER, LONGER, is caution-to-the-wind cursing.  Not more
than a lot of other R-rated films from, say, Martin Scorcese ­ like most
people seem to be obsessing about ­ mind you.  But, still; the creativity
with which these small fries spout about is, ah, a might off-setting.</P>
<P>Which takes only a few minutes to desensitize us to what we¹re hearing;
I mean, really, you hear ten mutterings of "pig-fucker" or "shit-smeller" (I
may be a little inaccurate with those examples, but you get it), and you¹ve
heard a lifetime.  So, just being crude wouldn¹t be enough.  No, series
creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone are not ones to rest on their
considerable laurels, and thus, this SOUTHPARK feature goes a step or two
further with a clever storyline:  the parents of our four young anti-heroes
are shocked by their newfound vocabulary.  A scapegoat is needed, but whom.
Canadians, of course.  War is declared, Terrance and Phillip are taken
hostage and their public execution planned out, and Cartman ­ following his
humorous ditty, "Kyle¹s Mom¹s a Bitch", sung by members of several different
nationalities ­ gets a chip put in his head that prevents further use of
foul language through shock treatment.  In the meantime, Kenny suffers his
usual death, goes to hell, where Satan and Sadam Hussein are lovers, and
Satan is a big softie and wants to be able to communicate with his partner
instead of just having sex all the time.  But, nevermind.</P>
<P>SOUTHPARK is entertaining, on top of being sleazy, and that is to be
commended.  Because it didn¹t have to be as good as it is, and who knew.
There are a fewŠ scratch that, way too many songs (some funny, some blah),
and that¹s why I say the film wears out its welcome.  Before that happens,
though, chances are you won¹t laugh more during any other movie this summer
than you will, here.</P>
<P>Highlights:  Winona Ryder¹s performance with a ping-pong ball; the
untimely murder of Bill Gates; that "Uncle Fucker" song from ASSES OF FIRE
(oh.. my.. god); Cartman¹s improvisational use of his neural implant, to
save the day.  And, needless to say, getting to see the true face of Kenny;
can¹t beat that.      </P>
