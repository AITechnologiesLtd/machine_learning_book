Grade:  B+</P>
<P>I remember an episode of "Donahue" soon after the Gulf War.  Phil came out and
stoked the crowd by declaring, "We kicked ass!"  Everyone cheered like their
team had just won the Super Bowl.  But then Phil started listing the number of
civilians killed by American bombs and all the issues left unresolved at the
end of the war, and the audience seemed very confused.  Somehow we expected
this war to be as simple as a "Die Hard" movie.</P>
<P>At the beginning of "Three Kings," the war has just ended.  While stripping a
prisoner, Troy (Mark Wahlberg) and Conrad (Spike Jonze) find a map sticking out
of his butt.  Special Forces Major Archie Gates (George Clooney) discovers that
the map shows the location of a fortune in gold that Iraq stole from Kuwait. 
Archie is ticked off because his current assignment is babysitting a reporter
(Nora Dunn), so he's open to a little pilfering that will allow him to retire
in style.  Along with Chief Elgin (Ice Cube), the guys set out into enemy
territory to retrieve the gold, brandishing like a weapon a letter from
President Bush that gives them permission to seize any contraband.  (And, by
the way, yes, there's four guys-I don't know which one isn't a king).  </P>
<P>When they find the gold, they also discover that the war isn't over for
everybody.  In the village where the gold is hidden, Iraqi troops are killing,
torturing, and starving the villagers.  The reason:  President Bush urged the
people to rise up against Saddam Hussein, implying that they would have
American support.  However, the American withdrawal left them at the mercy of a
dictator who wants to crush the rebellion.  </P>
<P>When Archie and company arrive, the enemy troops are so eager to see them leave
that they help the Americans load the gold.  Of course, our heroes are so moved
by the villagers' plight that they load up the people, too.  A battle breaks
out, and any chance that the guys can return quietly to base is lost.</P>
<P>"Three Kings" shifts tone drastically when its heroes discover the misery
created by America's too-simple war.  The movie begins with satiric bite,
chomping away at the assumptions of the American military.  My favorite moment
has Troy instructing his white-trash friend Conrad on the appropriate racial
slurs for their enemy.  When the guys take up the cause of the rebellion, the
tone becomes melodramatic, tugging at the audience's heartstrings with images
of children in danger and of peace-loving families threatened by aggression. 
The switch may be disconcerting to many viewers, and fans of one part of the
movie may not care for the other.  My taste is for the satire.  Director David
O. Russell has a flair for edgy comedy, but his turn to melodrama seems overly
manipulative.</P>
<P>Despite any flaws in its method, "Three Kings" deserves high praise for raising
questions about war and foreign policy.  Very few American films-especially
ones with high-profile stars-take on complex political issues that audiences
would rather not think about.  "Three Kings" forces anyone who sees it to
consider what America's role in the conflicts between other countries should be
and whether any conflict can ever be completely resolved.</P>
<P>Among the stars, Spike Jonze earns particular mention.  Although he is better
known as a director (of music videos and the new feature "Being John
Malkovich"), Jonze proves himself an able actor.  While his higher-billed
costars bring out their familiar, audience-tested personas, Jonze takes a
stereotypical redneck character and brings him to life.  Although he begins as
a dull-witted racist, Conrad becomes the most interesting and appealing
character of the film.</P>
<P>Bottom Line:  "Three Kings" plucks your heart strings too roughly, but it
challenges your mind to think about important issues.</P>
