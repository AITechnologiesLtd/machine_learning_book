<P>Rounders (1998) - Matt Damon, Edward Norton, Gretchen Mol, Martin Landau,
John Malkovich</P>
<P>   Everyone has their little problems. Matt Damon's character in
   "Rounders" has a big problem - a gambling problem that threatens to
   ruin his life more than once. "Rounders" flirts with being a great
   story about Mike McDermott (Damon) and his difficult path to a Pyrrhic
   victory, coming close, but never really making it.</P>
<P>   Despite having never joined a 12-step program, it's clear that Mike
   doesn't have all the cards in his deck. In the opening scenes of the
   movie, he loses his life savings, including the money he was using to
   pay his law school tuition. With some difficulty, he takes up
   low-paying night jobs and settles down with his girlfriend Jo
   (Gretchen Mol).</P>
<P>   Nine months later, an old card buddy with the appropriate nickname of
   Worm (Edward Norton) gets out of prison and promptly gets beat up for
   skipping out on his old gambling debts. Mike reluctantly returns to
   the shady world of illegal high-stakes poker to help Worm pay his
   debts, remembering why the game is so irresistible and watching the
   rest of his life collapse.</P>
<P>   Damon and Norton are both excellent actors, and it shows. The audience
   is given remarkable insight into Damon's character, from narrative
   voice-overs to the slightest facial expressions. Norton's "Worm" is,
   well, a bit of a worm - stacking decks with the best of them, Norton
   projects just the right blend of good intentions and bad habits.</P>
<P>   For the most part, the supporting cast - with character names like
   Petra, Kinish and Grandma - is also excellent. Martin Landau has a
   small but significant part as a law professor and McDermott's
   enigmatic mentor. John Malkovich, as the card shark, "KGB," is
   suitably devious and insane; his Oreo-munching performance alone is
   cause to see this movie.</P>
<P>   But "Rounders" fails to sell the story convincingly on two fronts. One
   is the premise - not everyone is familiar with poker, so a lot of the
   jargon may go right over some viewers' heads.</P>
<P>   The other is Mol. A key part of McDermott's fall from grace is the
   collapse of his romance with Jo, but it simply isn't plausible. Mol's
   emotional gauge is stuck on over-perky ex-cheerleader. There simply
   isn't any chemistry between her and Damon, and it's hard to care about
   their alleged relationship.</P>
<P>   "Rounders" - the term refers to a poker player who makes the rounds of
   local games - has so much potential. It could have been the next
   "The Color of Money," but merely deals us a pair instead of a straight
   flush.</P>
