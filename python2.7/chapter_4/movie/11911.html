<P>NO LOOKING BACK
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: ** (out of ****) 
Gramercy / 1:36 / 1998 / R (language)
Cast: Lauren Holly; Edward Burns; Jon Bon Jovi; Connie Britton; Blythe 
Danner; Kathleen Doyle; Jennifer Esposito; Nick Sandow 
Director: Edward Burns 
Screenplay: Edward Burns<HR>"No Looking Back" just never moves forward, a frustrating flaw 
considering Edward Burns is the man behind and in front of the camera. 
Burns, who had a Sundance Film Festival hit with his "The Brothers 
McMullen" debut a few years back, has demonstrated a keen eye for the 
dynamics and relationships between sibling males; along with his 
sophomore effort "She's the One," he's got only two movies under his 
belt, and both are perfectly amiable, comfortably lightweight romantic 
comedies. It's all the more strange, then, that his third is a drama 
with a female lead, and quite telling that the film is Burns' first 
forgettable feature -- an hour after the credits roll, there's a slim 
chance that anyone will be thinking back to "No Looking Back."</P>
<P>The movie takes place in a cold, grey, working-class New York town, 
beautifully photographed (especially in the opening sequence, set to 
Sheryl Crow's "Home") by Frank Prinzi. Claudia (Lauren Holly) has a 
simple life that seems to suit her well -- she spends days waiting 
tables at a local greasy spoon and nights with her live-in boyfriend 
Michael (rocker Jon Bon Jovi). But Claudia's ex Charlie (Burns), who 
upped and left her with a broken heart some time ago, suddenly 
resurfaces with hopes to pick up where they left off. It certainly 
doesn't help that Charlie and Michael were once best friends, and that 
the former's presence awakens an urge in Claudia to realize her dreams 
and follow them -- even if they include neither man. </P>
<P>While Burns the director and actor are fine, Burns the screenwriter is 
to blame for the movie's lack of ignition. Even though some of the 
dialogue is vintage Burns, No Looking Back truly goes nowhere; watching 
it is like listening to a piano player strike the same key over and over 
again. The skinny stories of "The Brothers McMullen" and "She's the One" 
look like "L.A. Confidential" by comparison. With the possible exception 
of Charlie (who's a regular S.O.B.), none of these characters are very 
interesting, so it's hard to get deeply involved in Claudia's dilemma, 
and we really need to for the movie to work. And at a slim 96 minutes, 
the movie feels too long, probably due to that distinct lack of 
involvement and the umpteen musical montages that interrupt the film 
every five minutes or so. </P>
<P>"No Looking Back" is, at the very least, an admirable performance piece. 
Holly gives a quiet, realistic spark to her first lead role; she is the 
truly is the "babe" that the entire cast always seems to refer to her 
as. Burns, who's cast himself as likeable cads in his other two films, 
shows range with the charmingly egotistic Charlie. Blythe Danner and 
"Spin City" co-stars Connie Britton and Jennifer Esposito do good work 
in various supporting parts. But perhaps most surprising of all is Bon 
Jovi, who has an acting career ahead of him if the music gig ever falls 
through. Speaking of which, his latest album is titled "Destination 
Anywhere," and anywhere is a better destination than the wasteland that 
"No Looking Back" finally occupies.<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck

‘Look Who's Talking Back,' in which the audience gets its turn?" --
