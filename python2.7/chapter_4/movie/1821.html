<PRE>                              THE CRYING GAME
                                 [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1993 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<PRE>2:04, R, Drama, 1992
Director: Neil Jordan
Cast: Stephen Rea, Miranda Richardson, Jaye Davidson, Forest Whitaker,
      Adrian Dunbar</PRE>
<P>     Stephen Rea is part of a terrorist organization in Ireland that
kidnaps soldier Forest Whitaker.  When Whitaker dies, upon Whitaker's
request, Rea goes to England to tell Whitaker's girlfriend what
happened.</P>
<P>     THE CRYING GAME has been in limited distribution and has just
opened nationwide.  This is a *must see* movie.  It is the best film
that I have seen in 1993.  On a scale of zero to five, I give THE
CRYING GAME a five.  THE CRYING GAME is rated R for explicit language,
adult situations, graphic violence, and brief male nudity.</P>
<P>     The writing for this film is great.  I am pleased to see that Neil
Jordan (MONA LISA, THE MIRACLE) has not yet conformed to Hollywood's
typical film standards.  This film is full of surprises and twists,
which make it well worth going to see.  Don't wait for the
videocassette for this film.  See it before you hear about the film's
surprises, because not knowing them makes the film all the more
enjoyable.</P>
<P>     The following may contain mild spoilers; read on with caution.</P>
<P>     THE CRYING GAME has been nominated for six academy awards; Best
Picture, Best Actor (Stephen Rea), Best Supporting Actor (Jaye
Davidson), and Film Editing (Kant Pan).  I feel that this film will
probably win at least one of the Oscars, probably Best Picture.</P>
<P>     The entire cast for this film is perfect.  Stephen Rea is great.
He makes his character completely believable and interesting.  Forest
Whitaker (DIARY OF A HITMAN; GOOD MORNING, VIETNAM), even though he is
not on the screen for much, is excellent.  He makes his character come
alive.  Jaye Davidson is great, and surprising.  Miranda Richardson
(DAMAGE, ENCHANTED APRIL) makes her character cruel and heartless.
Adrian Dunbar (HEAR MY SONG) gives a good performance as the leader of
the terrorist organization.  The man who plays the English bar keep is
excellent and reminds me of Robert Englund in "Nightmare Cafe."</P>
