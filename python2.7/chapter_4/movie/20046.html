<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The American dream is a rags-to-riches story. When one's inventive
ability is in a technical field, like telephone repairs, the occupation
the industrious Mal Granger (O'Brien) works at, and if the loose living
Mal gets there by dishonest means, which he does, then it makes his rise
to power a mockery. This is not the way the American dream is meant to
be earned. It can only be attained by the honest means of hard work and
fair play and through one's ability. At the time this film was being
made, there were national newspaper stories running about the dangers of
bookmaking, and this film was made as an answer to that expose. As a
noir story, shot handsomely in B/W, this film conveys Mal's rise to
power in the world of California bookies and his inevitable downfall,
caused by greed and bad judgment.</P>
<P>After losing to his bookie Chippie (Sammy) at the horses, Chippie
introduces him to the big wheel behind the operation, Vince Walters
(Kelley), thinking that they can help each other out. Mal uses his
technical skills from being a telephone repairman to rig the phone,
wiring all the bookies in California with racing results as soon as they
are announced at the track. When Mal feels he is being played for a
sucker by his boss, who is getting very rich from his savvy in
electronics, but paying him only a $150 weekly instead of cutting him in
for a share of the illegal profits, Mal is ready to double-cross him by
re-rigging the phones, thereby forcing himself in as a partner. The more
successful he becomes, the less scruples he has about being a full-time
criminal. When the operation cracks down on the local bookies, Mal
ignores their plight and sides with the cruel boss. A disgruntled
bookie, in a state of panic, at being forced out of business by the
syndicate, comes into the office and kills Vince. Taking advantage of
the situation, Mal now heads the syndicate.</P>
<P>There is a slight romantic interest shown for the nice girl (Dorothy)
who worked for Vince and who now works for Mal. But he spurns her in
favor of the hot love he has for Gail (Dru), who happens to be married
to one of the big bosses in the bookie field, Larry Mason (Donald
Porter). He represents the big syndicate's Eastern boss, the coy Carl
Stephens (Otto Kruger).</P>
<P>Lt. Pete Wright (Howard St. John), of the incorruptible gangster squad,
cracks down on the bookie operations across the state. Mal is forced
into joining the Eastern syndicate for protection, but he soon realizes
they are gypping him of his share and he also grows increasingly jealous
of Larry, who is not only married to the woman he loves but is now his
boss in the syndicate. So he hires a treacherous gunman (Osterloh) to
execute him. This results in his taking over Larry's position in the
mob.</P>
<P>When the hitman tries to muscle his way into Mal's organization, saying
he won't keep quiet if he isn't payed off with a partnership, Mal runs
him over. But in his panic, as the police question him, he uses the
alibi that he was vacationing in Palm Springs, rigging the phone to make
it appear as if he was there. This comes back to haunt him, as his call
is recorded and on it there is a trolley car whistle, which can only be
heard in the city.</P>
<P>The change in Mal is now complete, caught up in greed and power and
lust, he is being tracked by both the police and the mob. He escapes to
Las Vegas to rip off the mob for one last time in a phone rigging
gambling scheme, then gets trapped in the crossing of Hoover Dam, as he
tries to exit Nevada for his last chance of hope in Arizona, with the
police closing in on him.</P>
<P>The big boss, Otto Kruger, walks away from all this clean as a whistle,
as he goes back to his home in Ohio, seemingly still in charge of
things. This moralistic tale spins an interesting take on the criminal
genius who falls and the sychophant crime bosses, who can't be stopped
completely. In 1999, even with many states operating legal horse betting
parlors, the bookie business is bigger than ever. There is something
sinister to be said about the smiling Otto Kruger, that leaves a dark
shadow on the ground, as he heads back to his wealthy home, a part of
the American dream that is turned into a nightmare. Kruger also has the
best line in the film, when he tells Chippy, "I admire loyalty, but not
to the wrong people."</P>
