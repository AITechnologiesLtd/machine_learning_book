<P>Susan Granger's review of "PLAYING BY HEART" (Miramax Films)</P>
<P>Someone once said that "writing about music is like dancing
about architecture" - meaning it cannot be done - and film-maker
Willard Carroll was so taken with that sentiment that he called this
funny, poignant drama "Dancing About Architecture" until the MPAA
decreed that the title might be confused with "Dancing at Lughnasa."
"Playing by Heart" follows multiple characters from various
generations and lifestyles as they search for love in contemporary Los
Angeles during an eight day-and-night span.  Gena Rowlands and Sean
Connery head the cast as a mature couple approaching their 40th
wedding anniversary, and they're so superb together that it's a wonder
no one ever thought of teaming them before. Their story is intercut
with several others that are less interesting. Gillian Anderson is an
insecure stage director who has been so unlucky in love that she's
terrified of taking another chance.  Madeline Stowe and Anthony
Edwards are embroiled in a steamy extra-marital affair. Ellen Burstyn
coming to terms with her son, Jay Mohr, who is dying of AIDS.  Dennis
Quaid is a drunk, telling sob stories to Nastassja Kinski, Patricia
Clarkson, and even a compassionate drag queen, Alec Mapa. And sassy,
spunky Angelina Jolie of Generation X finds herself flirting with a
surly bystander, Ryan Phillippe, as she splits up with her boyfriend
by phone in a nightclub.  Reminiscent in structure of Alan Rudolph's
"Welcome to L.A." and Robert Altman's "Short Cuts," it has the benefit
of intelligent dialogue, Vilos Zsigmond's superb camerawork and John
Barry's evocative score; predictably, some storylines work better than
others. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Playing by Heart" is
an engaging ensemble 6, offering sentimental entertainment based on
the many faces of love.</P>
