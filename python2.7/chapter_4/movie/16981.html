<P>I'm writing this as I'm waiting for Oracle to churn out a big new
tablespace for the developers to do some testing in later this week.
This exercise began, in 15-minute fits and starts and a spasm of
e-mail, late last week, when the request came down the line,
resurfacing Friday, when I got scheduled downtime to bounce the RDBMS
early Saturday to twiddle a parameter set by the guys who set up this
instance in the first place (two hours worth of Saturday morning
twiddling, most of it spent waiting around for the OS to do a cold
backup in case something disasterous happened), finally culminating in
executing three glorious SQL commands this Monday morning.  Yes, the
new Mike Judge movie, "Office Space", struck a small cord in the
stupidest of places, when Our Hero is watching his workstation get
bogged down in I/O.  Yes, it was a cliched scene, but I'm spending part
of my recent time watching I/O happen.  And I don't even have the
benefit of a little spinning disk to tell me something is going on.</P>
<P>It's an uneven movie, though.  Though it's far, far better than the
very disappointing Beavis and Butthead movie, "Office Space" is only
about as good as a good "King of the Hill" episode.  The best parts are
the wonderful moments that show the little frustrations of
post-industrial America.  Some scenes of wish fulfillment were
fantastic, most notably gutting the fish (if only he used a Leatherman)
and an ultraviolent, gangsta video inspired beating.  Their office
bulding, by the way, looked eeriely like my company's Dallas office,
which I recently had to visit: acres of parking lot surrounding a large
flat building.  The Dallas office, however, looks a bit more run down
and dimly lit than the one in the movie, at least the area where the
DBAs sat.</P>
<P>[Ah, that bit of I/O just finished.  Now to FTP (a continuation of I/O
by an admixture of means) a bunch of export files...]</P>
<P>The film loses steam towards the end, or when it gets too involved with
this Superman III-style plot hatched by Our Hero and his downsized
coworkers.  The writing's fine edge in depicting office life is lost
when it tries to move a story, a not particularly interesting one at
that.  This scheme, unfortunately, takes up a good part of the second
half of the movie.  As noted, the film is inconsistent, a better rental
than anything else.</P>
<P>The film also dips a toe in the more blue-collar world of food service
through Our Hero's love interest, a waitress played by Jennifer
Aniston.  No array of indignities confront the waitress, however, only
the single indignity of having to wear "flair" to spice up a drab
uniform: stupid little buttons, slogans and cheesy ties and
LED-enhanced ribbons to be worn as an expression of institutional
creativity.  The web of small indignities from, say, the customers, is
wholely absent: Judge apparently wants to focus on the absurdities that
descent from the managers up on high like manna.  Well, that, and
office equipment.  [Harpers Magazine a few issues ago had Barbara
Ehrenreich pose as a waitress for a month in a variety of places, a
sort of limosine liberal exercise in showing the inadequacy of minimal
wage.  If nothing else, that article suggests that Aniston's minimum of
fifteen pieces of flair is the least of worries.]</P>
<P>[So, the FTP is done.  Now, gzip -d.  Yes, I feel I'm being paid
absurdly much for absurdly little.]</P>
<P>Our Hero, incidentally, finds joy at the end in manual labor.
(Something I'm not unsymapthetic to, having noted that digging a ditch
at least lives you with a ditch at the end of the day, instead of this
abstraction running with the aid of metaphorical baling wire and duct
tape on some computer I've never actually seen.  But then, I've never
dug a ditch, so I really shouldn't be glorifying the whole thing, given
that I'd probably think ditch digging really, really sucks if I had to
do it, despite my going to the gym nowadays.) I suppose Judge's final
point is that there's dignity in labor or work, just that it's usually
lost in the actions of petty managers, clueless consultants and absurd
institutional rules.  It's a new dialectic: the bosses and the
bureaucracy are the new bourgeois, the owners of the mission statement
and time card.  The rest of us are the post-industrial proletariate,
office workers and glorified burger flippers.</P>
<PRE>[Well, gzip is done.  Now to import.]</PRE>
