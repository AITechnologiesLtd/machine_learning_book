<P>Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie seems to have taken quite a bit of
time off after his 1995 Oscar triumph for Best Screenplay for THE USUAL
SUSPECTS. McQuarrie was apparently being asked to do another crime film
wherever he went, and decided to make one himself so that "no one would ever
ask him to make another crime film again". Hmmm...strange wish, but okay!
Now let's see how Chris handles the directing end of things.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Two out-of-luck schnooks looking for a fortune to save them from their dead
end lives, kidnap a surrogate mother with hopes of demanding big-time moolah
from the rich parents of the baby upcoming. Of course, things never go off
without a hitch, and the two boys quickly have to deal with problems
arising. This includes the two bodyguards who were hired to protect her, the
bagman, who wants to make a deal with them, and the surrogate mother
herself, who turns out to be more than a handful.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This film's got plenty of style and blood to spare, even a couple of decent
rat-tat-tat scenes tossed here and there, but the plot is just too elaborate
for its own good. Coming from the writer of THE USUAL SUSPECTS, I certainly
expected some confusion, although not to this extent, but I damn sure didn't
expect this film to be so boring at times. Yeah, that's right, there is a
whole stretch at the center of this movie that is just plain tedious. The
film features about three very cool shoot-out scenes, a very funny opening
scene and fills the rest of its time going back and forth between way too
many characters all bitching about who's gonna do what to do whom
next...over and over and over again. "And here's my
motivation"...bla-bla-bla-bla-bla...can we get on with it already!? Of
course, the biggest problem is that you just don't care about any of these
characters, so while they're all going on and on about what they want to do
and what they think should be done next, you're just left wondering why the
film isn't keeping you all that interested. Add to that, the fact that many
of the characters eventually start revealing connecting relationships to one
another, and it all starts feeling a little too much like a giant soap opera
with bullets.</P>
<P>Overall, I would say that I was disappointed with the film. I suppose that
my expectations were a bit too high and few of them were met. Sure, Benicio
Del Toro was good as usual, the score appropriately dour, reminiscent of the
Leone flicks with that extra Tex-Mex feel, and the shoot out scenes really
loud (and I mean LOUD!) and bloody (Peckinpah anyone?). But with so much
downtime and overwrought dialogue, a lot of which just felt "written", I
just didn't like enough things in the movie. It's also the kind of film that
seems to want you to see it a couple of more times in order to fully absorb
its convoluted plotline. What a shame. A great trailer, some really cool
actors, including Diggs and Caan who both come off very well, but ultimately
way too many stupid side characters, like the dweeby doctor and the
completely one-dimensional bitchy wife, and the film erodes under its own
over-ambition. And even though blood never really bothers me, though it
might bother some people after this movie, I was particularly taken aback by
one bloody "operation" scene near the end of the film that just grossed me
out completely. A little "overdone", I thought.</P>
<P>All in all, I suppose I was not "taken" by as much of this film as I had
hoped but certainly wouldn't qualify it as a bad picture. Others may enjoy
it for their own reasons, and I will admit that it does contain many
positive elements, including a memorable score, solid directing and some
great shoot-out scenes. Check it out and let me know what you think.</P>
