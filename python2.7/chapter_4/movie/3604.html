<P>     I have often said that the first responsibility of a
historically based film is not necessarily to be good history, but
to be good drama.  Documented facts can sometimes make for a
compelling story on their own, but usually a bit of creative license
is not merely acceptable, it's required.  So how can I say that out
of one side of my mouth, while with the other I criticize PANTHER
for being a mediocre account of the rise of the Black Panther Party?
Because by painting the characters in a far too positive light, the
filmmakers have robbed the characters of their humanity, and
everything that might make them interesting.  While there are a
number of powerful images, PANTHER is a one-note drama which misses
the opportunity to include some internal conflict.</P>
<P>     PANTHER opens in 1967, with the formation of the Black Panther
Party in Oakland by Bobby Seale (Courtney B. Vance) and Huey Newton
(Marcus Chong).  With white police officers brutalizing their
neighborhoods with impunity, Seale and Newton begin recruiting black
youths to help defend the community.  Among those they attempt to
recruit is Judge (Kadeem Hardison), a Vietnam vet and college
student unsure about whether to work for change inside or outside
the system.  Loudly proclaiming their Constitutional rights, the
Black Panthers arm themselves and begin policing the police.  This
development doesn't sit at all well with local law enforcement,
which attempts to turn Judge into an informant, or with FBI chief J.
Edgar Hoover (Richard Dysart), whose plans for eliminating the
Panthers are far more extreme.</P>
<P>     Mario Van Peebles is developing into a director with a real
flair for powerful visuals, and PANTHER is no exception.  His use of
documentary footage and different film stocks has a bit of Oliver
Stone theatricality, but without the wretched excess.  The early
scenes of the Panthers' emergence as a force have a tense energy.
In one such scene, a group of armed Panthers stop a pair of police
officers from beating a black man, resulting in a showdown witnessed
by hundreds of blacks awed by the sight of black men standing up to
the white establishment and getting away with it.  It is a vivid
example of why the Black Panthers' message was so widely embraced,
and why they became so powerful so quickly.</P>
<P>     What Van Peebles is unable to do is provide any real sense of
who these men were, and the reason is one of intent.  Both
screenwriter Melvin and director Mario are not particularly
interested in creating characters, it seems; they want to create
idols.  Bobby Seale is presented as a serene sort of philosopher-
king, relegated to the background in favor of the more vocal Huey
Newton.  But even Newton becomes little more than a figurehead, a
mouthpiece for a message rather than a fully-realized man.  Kadeem
Hardison's Judge is the narrator of the story, and for a while it
appears that his character will provide a degree of ambiguity as he
struggles with whether or not to join the Panthers.  That ambiguity
is short-lived, as he becomes a dedicated soldier with no doubts as
soon as he puts on the black beret.  There is a single scene of
Eldridge Cleaver (well-played by Anthony Griffith) breaking ranks to
take more forceful action, but with that exception the Black
Panthers in PANTHER come off as one collective consciousness.</P>
<P>     The absence of any real internal conflict makes PANTHER become
extremely derivative.  The first couple of times, the sight of Huey
Newton forcing an arrogant cop to back down (including once while
protecting Malcolm X's widow Betty Shabazz, played by Angela Bassett
reprising her role from MALCOLM X) is exciting.  The tenth or
eleventh time, it has long since lost its sting.  There are just too
many scenes of sneering brutality which become interchangeable in a
way I'm sure the Van Peebles' did not want.  The addition of a
government/mafia conspiracy to flood the black community with cheap
drugs only emphasizes the fact that this is a story entirely about
looking outward.  The Black Panther story is an important part of an
important time, but it could have had real power if PANTHER had been
more about the men behind the movement and less an exercise in hero
worship.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Black Panthers:  5.</PRE>
