<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Postal Inspector is a goofy B action thriller with Bela Lugosi as the
shady owner of a prominent nightclub. Cute nightclub singer Patricia
Ellis is on a plane with Postal Inspector Ricardo Cortez coming into the
small-town of Millstown. Due to foggy conditions the passengers are
nervous, so Ricardo comes up with the bright idea that Ellis sing to the
passengers to calm their fears. Waiting at the airport is nightclub
owner Bela to greet Ellis and use the plane story to get publicity for
his nightclub. Michael Loring is waiting for his older brother Ricardo,
but recognizes Ellis as the sweet hometown girl who went to the big city
to get fame. He immediately makes a date with her and by the end of the
film will marry her.</P>
<P>Ricardo is all post office rah-rah, as he exults in the good work his
men are doing to catch crooks who use the postal service to cheat the
public. He's a no-nonsense guy. FDR is heard in a radio address
congratulating the postal inspectors for delivering the gold for the
Federal Reserve System to inland cities across the country without a
hitch, and Ricardo beams with pride upon hearing that praise by the
president.</P>
<P>Catching Ellis sing at the nightclub, the brothers chat about how
important their job is. Loring, who also works for the post office,
tells Ellis about a three million dollar transfer of money the post
office is making tomorrow. Not realizing that this is supposed to be a
secret, Ellis jokingly tells this to Bela. What she doesn't know, is
that Bela owes $50,000 to a mobster who threatens to kill him if he
doesn't fork over the dough.</P>
<P>When a flood hits their town and all activity is hampered, Bela steals
Loring's car--the one he lent to Ellis--and uses that car to pull off
the postal heist. He also kills a postal worker. The postal inspectors
suspect Loring and Ellis of the crime. But the couple tracks down Bela
in his secret hiding place and the film ends in an exciting motorboard
chase through the flooded city.</P>
<P>This is an obscure Bela Lugosi film and it's not bad. Ellis is the dame
with class. She sings the happy tune "Bluebirds on wallpaper decorating
our dreams." Bela's the bad guy with a foreign accent. His fans will
love him here, as this film has been restored recently and is now
watchable.</P>
