<P>CONSPIRACY THEORY (Warner Bros. / Donner/Schuler-Donner Productions /
Silver Pictures)</P>
<PRE>MPAA Certification: R
Genre: Action/thriller
Cast: Mel Gibson, Julia Roberts, Patrick Stewart, Cylk Cozart
Directed by Richard Donner</PRE>
<PRE>My personal rating: 4 out of 6</PRE>
<P>CONSPIRACY THEORY wasn't very well received by audience and critics.
Personally, I think it lacked a sense of nerve and thrill. Mel Gibson
plays Jerry Fletcher, a paranoid taxi-driver with an extraordinary
past. He spends most of his time telling passengers of his conspiracy
theories and writing a newsletter named after the movie. Julia Roberts
is the U.S. Justice Department agent Alice Sutton. She met Fletcher
earlier when he saved her from some muggers. Constantly bothering
Sutton with his conspiracy theories, one day Fletcher finds himself
captured by ill-natured agents. The FBI, CIA and "all the other initials 
one could put together" seem to be after him. He can't understand why,
only that is has something to do with his past, and maybe his "thing"
for conspiracy theories. </P>
<P>CONSPIRACY THEORY didn't quite enthrall me. Although Gibson is good
as Fletcher (maybe he borrowed some of his LETHAL WEAPON character?),
Roberts doesn't impress very much. She is more of a romantic character,
and only in a few scenes I feel that Alice Sutton is captivating.
Patrick Stewart plays the bad guy, but he lacks a certain evil charisma
that one would expect in a such a character.</P>
<P>All in all, half action, half thriller, but neither genre was fully
mastered. CONSPIRACY THEORY's plot is interesting, but the screenplay
as a whole doesn't succeed. Richard Donner has done well as the 
director, however.</P>
