<P>     We've seen this Robin Williams before, though not much recently.  We
saw him in GOOD MORNING, VIETNAM as the disc jockey whose unconventional
approach to military broadcasting endears him to grunts while irritating
The Establishment; we saw him in DEAD POETS SOCIETY as the teacher whose
unconventional approach to literature endears him to students while
irritating The Establishment.  This is Robin Williams the crowd-pleasing
riff-meister, playing the comedy-drama character arc in which he is
temporarily sobered by tragedy but eventually emerges triumphant in the
lives he has touched with humor.</P>
<P>     This is the Robin Williams -- the stand-up comic with the heart of
gold -- that we see in PATCH ADAMS, the fact-based story of a medical
student whose unconventional approach to patient care endears him to
patients while irritating The Establishment.  Unfortunately, we've never
seen this character so compromised by such an aggressively feel-good film.
It opens in 1969, where Hunter "Patch" Adams is a voluntary inmate in a
mental hospital.  His experience with the patients there energizes him
with a desire to heal, leading to his enrollment two years later in
medical school.  There he becomes a top student, but angers a conservative
dean (Bob Gunton) by testing his theory that laughter is the best medicine
on actual hospital patients.  While repeatedly butting heads with
administrators, Patch and two classmates (Monica Potter and Daniel London)
commit themselves to creating a place where they can treat patients not
just with prescriptions, but with compassion, personal contact and big red
clown noses.</P>
<P>     The first half of PATCH ADAMS certainly belongs to Williams the
Clown, given free rein to do his stuff; not coincidentally, it's also the
most entertaining half.  He performs and pratfalls for a juvenile oncology
ward, grants the wishes of the ailing and elderly, and breaks through the
anger of a surly terminally ill man (ubiquitous commercial voice Peter 
Coyote).  His rebel with the mile-a-minute mind delivers quite a few
laughs through an hour of PATCH ADAMS, but then again, he has to.  It's so
obvious where this narrative is headed from the moment he enters medical
school, Williams offers the only spark of invention.  Even when contending
with the hammering pathos of grinning, hairless children, he still has the
ability to disarm an audience with a joke.</P>
<P>     Those grinning, hairless children do bode ill for the second half,
when PATCH ADAMS gets serious on us.  It's not just that screenwriter
Steve Oedekerk and director Tom Shadyac (who teamed up on Eddie Murphy's
THE NUTTY PROFESSOR) play to the most cliched devices of emotional
manipulation, like a tearful speech over a grave and a pedantic speech in
a courtroom setting.  What's worse is that they don't understand when 
_not_ to resort to emotional manipulation.  There is a particularly
distasteful moment in PATCH ADAMS when a character reveals that she is a
survivor of childhood sexual abuse.  Instead of allowing the scene any
sort of sensitivity or dignity, they turn it into a romantic interlude,
complete with Marc Shaiman's obtrusive, syrupy underscore (Shaiman's work
should be declared a health risk for diabetics).  PATCH ADAMS not only
dares you not to be uplifted, it jams a forklift under your seat and
slowly grinds you into the ceiling of the theater.</P>
<P>     I know plenty of viewers will be amused enough by Williams' antics to
consider PATCH ADAMS worthwhile.  I know plenty of viewers will be
applauding Patch sticking it to Big Medicine as the end credits roll.
PATCH ADAMS is a calculated, carefully constructed Response Machine,
unencumbered by complexities like making the traditional doctors anything
more than ogres.  True story or no, this is a vehicle for Robin Williams
as we've known him best and loved him most.  He's the non-conformist ready
to quip you into submission...except that he appears all-too-willing to
conform to formulaic roles in formulaic films.  Doctor, order this film up
an IV of subtlety, stat.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Patch-work quips:  5.</PRE>
