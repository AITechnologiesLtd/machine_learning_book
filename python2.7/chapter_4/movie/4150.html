<PRE>                                TOTAL ECLIPSE
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Picture this:  A movie about two 19th century French poets.  How
does that sound?  It sounds like a bad idea because it *is* a bad
idea.</P>
<P>     It's a worse idea than the talent in this picture would probably
care to admit to.  Leonardo DiCaprio stars in yet another
true-story-about-poets movie this year, following up his excellent
portrayal of teenage wacko Jim Carroll in THE BASKETBALL DIARIES with
one of even more wacko teenager Arthur Rimbaud in TOTAL ECLIPSE.  David
Thewlis (NAKED) is Paul Verlaine, a slightly older poet who becomes
entranced with Rimbaud, who returns his affections with little more
than scorn and physical abuse.  Verlaine in turn passes this abuse on
to his pregnant wife, Mathilde (Romane Bohringer).</P>
<P>     Verlaine tries to get inside Rimbaud's skin, ostensibly to make
himself a better poet, and the film spends inordinate amounts of time
following their misadventures:  Verlaine and Rimbaud crash a party;
Verlaine and Rimbaud frolic in a field; Verlaine and Rimbaud frolic on
the street; Verlaine and Rimbaud frolic on a beach.  Are you still
awake?</P>
<P>     Rimbaud ends up converting Verlaine from a mild-mannered gentleman
into a certifiable nut bar.  And for some reason, they keep stabbing
and shooting each other when they aren't drinking absinthe to excess.
In the end, the movie is a nearly unwatchable look at a couple of
people who we don't understand any better by the time the film is
over.  In other words:  a complete waste of time.</P>
<P>     It wouldn't have been so bad if there was a speck of likeability
in any of these characters, but they are so disgusting and crass, I
just wanted to leave the theater halfway through.  But I didn't.
Instead, I stuck it out to see if some big payoff awaited me for wading
through the 110 minutes of boredom, but alas there was none.  I was
afraid the movie was never going to end with its drawn-out, weepy,
melodramatic finale.  Boo hoo.</P>
<P>     Director Agnieszka Holland has a bad habit of making either really
good movies (EUROPA, EUROPA) or really bad ones (OLIVIER, OLIVIER).
TOTAL ECLIPSE is her worst, with the stylistic direction earning the
film its 1/2 star.  That's being generous.</P>
