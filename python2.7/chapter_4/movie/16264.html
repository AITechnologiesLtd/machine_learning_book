<P>The MTV generation have movies of their own while others have theirs. 
It's nice, however, when we can trade off and occasionally enjoy each
other's product.  'Varsity Blues' is the type of movie that teenagers
can enjoy for showing themselves what they're capable of, both
positively and negatively.  Certainly, it is frivolous in many scenes --
a rather mindless barrage of high school pranks with shock waves felt
today by the cultural impact of 'National Lampoon's Animal House' and
'Fast Times at Ridgemont High'. Entertaining to be sure but rather
forgettable otherwise.</P>
<P>Jon Voight has become the quintessential movie bad guy in recent years. 
'Mission Impossible', 'Anaconda', 'The Rainmaker', 'Enemy of the State'
and now 'Varsity Blues', put Voight in the spotlight of railroading the
good side of human behaviour in favour of the self serving movie
villain.  He pulls it off sharply with squinting looks of evil that
prove that in many ways the villain is the true test of an actor. 
Perhaps that's why Voight has an Oscar in his collection for Best Actor
for 1978's 'Coming Home'.  Although his performance was that of a
Vietnam veteran made a paraplegic by the most unjust war of the 20th
century, his performance was one of strength and you really felt pride
for one of the movie's true good guys.  Although Voight is only a
supporting player in 'Varsity Blues', he gets first mention because it's
really him that propels me to give this film a marginal recommendation.</P>
<P>James Van Der Beek of television's 'Dawson Creek' plays John Moxen, the
back up quarterback of a varsity high school football team who gets a
chance to prove himself when the more than capable starter gets hurt. 
His aloof friend Billy Bob (Ron Lester) is responsible in a way for the
starting quarterback's injuries and vows not to let anything happen to
the new replacement.  They play football in a small town in West Canaan,
Texas...where football isn't just a game or a way of life, but is a form
of religion.</P>
<P>There are the usual plot sidelines such as the girls in their lives. 
The other players, some of whom exhibit criminal behaviour, and the win
at all costs attitude of Coach Kilmer (Jon Voight).  This includes
injecting players with painkillers when he knows they could be severely
injured later on.  His racist tendencies in failing to give the ball
when necessary to the film's talented star running back who is black is
a further measure in lowering the team's morale and his blackmail of one
of the players that will prevent him from obtaining a full academic
scholarship are just some of the coach's other personality traits.</P>
<P>What's refreshing about this movie is the way it highlights the film's
important moments and never treats them as trifle, overplayed or silly
-- like the team sticking together in rejecting the coach's tactics, the
scene where Moxen is put to the test to see if he will cheat on his
girlfriend and how the players showcase their submission to a team
leader capable of bringing them back from the brink of losing with
disgraced feelings.</P>
<P>The film is directed by Brian Robbins ('Good Burger').  His aptitude in
filming and editing the impact of the gridiron is impressive and ranks
up there with 1993's 'The Program' as some of the best football scenes
put on film since 1974's 'The Longest Yard'.  I would rather have seen
'Varsity Blues' as a television network movie of the week because it's
overall feeling is more like a field goal than a touchdown but the drive
is still successful nevertheless.</P>
