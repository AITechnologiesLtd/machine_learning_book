A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Instant fame is a dream of many, but at what cost does it come?
Director Ron Howard's latest film, Ed TV, takes a critical look at the
price of celebrity.  This comedy doesn't pack as hefty a punch as it
hopes for, but it is often funny enough that it doesn't matter.</P>
<P>TrueTV is a cable network in search of a gimmick, and, after a
brainstorm, programming executive Cynthia (Ellen DeGeneres) believes she
has found one. The network will broadcast the life of an average
American, live and uncut, 24 hours a day.</P>
<P>After a nationwide search, the lucky winner is Ed Pekurny (Matthew
McConaughey), a video store clerk in San Francisco.  Talked into the
gimmick by his brother Ray (Woody Harrelson), Ed thinks that gaining
instant fame will be fun.</P>
<P>But, after a while, the lack of privacy starts to sink home.  As Ed
becomes a celebrity, cracks begin to appear in his previously stable
family.  First, Ed begins an affair with Ray's girlfriend, Shari (Jenna
Elfman). Soon, long buried family secrets begin to surface, and Ed
desperately searches for a way out.</P>
<P>On first glance, Ed TV seems to sound an awful lot like last year's The
Truman Show.  Both films do feature 24-hour tv shows revolving around
the life of one man. In fact, both movies feature nearly the same
reaction shots of "typical" members of the television audience.
However, whereas The Truman Show was analyzing the boundaries between
reality and entertainment, Ed TV is more interested in examining the
culture of celebrity.</P>
<P>Though Ed TV's criticisms about the ultimate cost of fame ring true, the
underlying concept of a popular 24-hour channel devoted to Ed just
doesn't seem plausible.  An edited show, maybe...but in today's instant
gratification culture, it's hard to imagine a show where days or weeks
would pass before something actually happens.</P>
<P>But, with several months compressed into a two-hour film, there's hardly
a lack of activity in the movie, Ed TV.  In fact, it begins to seem odd
that so many big and important events occur in Ed's life during these
few months.  A few of the moments seem a bit too scripted (the cat
scene, for one), but nearly all are enjoyable.</P>
<P>Ed TV does certainly have a stellar cast.  In addition to those
mentioned above, Rob Reiner, Dennis Hopper, Elizabeth Hurley and Sally
Kirkland also star.  In the film's most enjoyable role, Martin Landau
shines as Al, Ed's stepfather.  He simply steals every scene he's in.</P>
<P>The conclusion of Ed TV feels a bit rushed.  The heretofore amiable
network all of a sudden is painted as pure evil.  But, even if the
wrapup lacks dramatic weight, the movie delivers quite a good time
getting there.</P>
