<P>IN SHORT: Fast moving, very cool battles. Slower moving story.</P>
<P>Being an epic-type film, "slow" is about the only negative I can toss at
Ridley Scott's Gladiator and those of you that are into "epic" length
flicks should not have any kind of problem with the flick. Everyone
else, stick to the small soda and popcorn, 'cuz you won't want to be
ducking out on the story, whose recreation of ancient Rome is a wondrous
thing to behold. Scott wanted to recreate a long lost world and, with
seamless integration of CG effects, has. So a tip of the hat to him, and
to whichever of the writers came up with the line "At my signal, unleash
hell." That's how we begin this film, with a battle between the Roman
Legions led by General Maximus (Russell Crowe) and the barbarian hordes
of Germania. Far behind the battlelines, watching hell unleashed, is the
dying Roman Emperior Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) who has decided
that Maximus should succeed him as Emperor.</P>
<P>This doesn't sit well with the first born son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix)
who, through a good deal of dramatic manipulation, takes the throne and
sentences Maximus and his family to death. Gladiator is still firing on
all cylinders at this point, as Maximus survives to find himself sold
into slavery for the gladiator pits in the outer reaches of the Empire.
Nicknamed "the Spaniard" and believed to be a deserter from the Roman
Legion, he is befriended by an African named Juba (Djimon Honsou) and
battles for his life under the ownership of freed former Gladiator
Proximo (Oliver Reed). Newly crowned Emperor Commodus orders the
Gladiators back to the Colosseum and you can guess what's coming from
there.</P>
<P>That's where politics rears its ugly head and slows the story down . . .
or adds a whole ton of real story to what would otherwise be a simple
man seeking vengeance scenario. The political end involves Commodus'
sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), who would've been Emperor save for an
accident of birth and Marcus Aurelius' final wish, to restore the Roman
Republic and the democracy founded there. The head of the Roman Senate,
and a co-plotter in these actions is Gracchus (Derek Jacobi), who
brought the story of Claudius to Masterpiece Theater years ago. We
wonder what Jacobi made of the fact that the story of Claudius plays a
key role in the twists in the story of Gladiator. Debate and discuss.</P>
<P>On the grand scale of the big screen, this is the kind of movie that
should be seen on the biggest one available. The opening battle and the
CG reconstructions of the Colosseum alone are worth the price of the
ticket. The battles could force some of us into testosterone overload.
Once the pace slows down, though, so does the rush and the excitement.</P>
<P>Gladiator is gonna make Russell Crowe a major star, his nomination for
The Insider notwithstanding. His characterization of Maximus, the
maturity of the relationship with Lucilla and sheer hatred of Commodus
are the stuff that people talk of.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Gladiator, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$6.50</PRE>
<P>Seven less a deduction for the length. Speaking strictly from a guy's
standpoint, the rush from the  opening battle alone will carry you
through the first hour and a half.</P>
