Matinee (1993)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 65</PRE>
<P>"Matinee" is a comedy with dramatic elements.  It takes
place in Key West, Florida, in 1962 during the Cuban Missile
Crisis.  John Goodman is perfectly cast as Lawrence Woosley,
a producer of schlocky horror films, who comes to Key West
to promote his latest film, "Mant."  His special other is
the jaded Ruth Corday (Cathy Moriarty) who also is the leading
lady in his films.  She makes frequent vague threats to 
leave him, but Goodman's character is so good-natured 
that he always just laughs.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Gene Loomis (Simon Fenton) is a teenage boy
living on the Key West Naval base with his parents, his
father having been sent to help blockade the Cubans.
He is a big fan of Goodman's films and, discovering that
Goodman is in town, follows him around to learn the secrets
of the trade.</P>
<P>Gene's love interest is Sandra, a student whose passionate 
and unpopular political opinions are encouraged by her
liberal parents.  Gene becomes friends with Stan, who has
a thing for Shelly (Kellie Martin).  Shelly has strong
sexual desires that Stan doesn't quite understand.  
Unfortunately for Stan, she has has a former boyfriend,
a street punk named Harvey Starkweather.</P>
<P>Harvey's character is the weak link of the film.  The
writers try to do too much with him.  He writes beatnik
poetry, dresses in leather, is unstable and acts like a
punk.  He also is in love with Shelly, and has jealous
rages over her that threaten Stan's health.</P>
<P>Threatended by Harvey, Stan breaks a date with Shelly,
instead going to see "Mant".  Gene is there also, with
his kid brother and new girlfriend Sandra.  Harvey has
been hired by Goodman to run the film's sound controls,
and to dress up in a Mant suit and run around the theatre
at key moments of the film.  Spector, a big movie distributor,
is also at the movie and is being wooed by Goodman.
Gene talks to Shelly and patches things up between Shelly
and Stan, who neck in aisle seats.</P>
<P>"Mant" is a hilarous parody of a fifies/early sixties
horror film.  A man has been exposed to radiation and is
turning into an ant, head and arms first.  There is a silly
love triangle between Mant, his wife, and his dentist.
At other moments during the film there are several parodies
of sixties movies and their previews that are equally funny,
especially a scene from "The Shook Up Shopping Cart" that is
a riot.</P>
<P>Harvey, in the Mant suit, catches Stan and Shelly and goes
beserk, later dragging her off at knifepoint.  In the commotion
Goodman and company leave the theatre. The theatre owner has a bomb
shelter with a bolted time-controlled lock.  Mistaking the
movie for a bombing raid, the owner prepares his bomb shelter,
but accidentally locks Gene and Sandra inside, who believe 
that the world is coming to an end.</P>
<P>Once Harvey has been taken away by the police and Shelly
is safe, Goodman returns to the theatre.  The unsupervised kids 
have been rioting in the balcony, threatening the lives of
the patrons.  Goodman switches films, making the audience
believe that nuclear holocaust has come.  The theatre empties
except for Gene's kid brother, who must be rescued from the
collapsing balcony.</P>
