<PRE>                              MIAMI RHAPSODY
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Gwyn Marcus (Sarah Jessica Parker) is in a quandary.  She has just
said "Yes" to Matt (Gil Bellows).  She thought a marriage such as her
parents Nina and Vic have (Mia Farrow and Paul Mazursky)  is just what
she would like for herself when she begins to notice that all is not as
appears on the surface.</P>
<P>     First time director/writer David Frankel has come up with a nice,
pleasant comedy and if the situations are somewhat forced but you are
able to accept them as comic you will enjoy the film.  For instance,
everyone, Gwyn discovers, is having affairs.   Her own sweet mother and
Antonio (Antonio Banderas) are meeting regularly, romantically.   He is
the young male nurse who is taking care of bedridden Grandma.
Meanwhile Dad is having a longtime fling with his travel agent.  In
fact the movie leaves no one out;  with the exception of poor innocent
Gwyn, everyone is doing it.</P>
<P>     Is this what Gwyn wants from marriage?  Is this what will be her
fate, too?   This being a movie and this being a comedy all ends
well ... or pretty well.</P>
<P>     The cast carries the story nicely: Mia Farrow is light-hearted
(unlike in Woody Allen films), Antonio Banderas is handsome, Gil Barrows
makes a nice boyfriend for Gwyn, and Sarah Jessica Parker continues to
do well as she has in her last half dozen films.</P>
