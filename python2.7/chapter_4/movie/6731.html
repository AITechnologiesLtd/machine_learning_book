                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>Metro (1997) NO STARS out of ***** - C:Eddie Murphy, Michael Rapaport.</P>
<P>There are some people who think that Eddie Murphy is having a comeback.  Then
there are people like me, who believe Eddie Murphy hasn't made a good movie
since 1988's "Coming To America".  For those of you who believe he's having a
comeback, the comeback is over.</P>
<P>Even though 1997 has barely begun, I seriously doubt there will be a movie
as atrociously bad this year as "Metro".  In all my years of movie-going,
this was the very first time I had ever decided "enough is enough" and
promptly walked out of the theater after one hour.  And I'm surprised that I
even lasted that long.</P>
<P>In "Metro", Eddie Murphy plays a hostage negotiator for the San Francisco
police department.  The plot (which really must have developed during the
second hour because there's nothing going on in the first) involves
something about an overacting villain who is involved in stolen jewelry.
Oooo, a jewel thief, call the hostage negotiator!  Early on, Murphy's buddy
on the force is killed by the overacting villain (ooo, I've never seen that
plot twist before) and Murphy gets to train a new partner (Rapaport plays
the partner, in a plot twist I've never seen before).  Also, Murphy keeps
trying (pathetically) to woo back his ex-girlfriend.  Will he catch the bad
guy?  Will he get his girl back?  I could care less, but I guarantee you that
he does.</P>
<P>There's also a car chase through the mountainous streets of San Francisco
(say, I've never seen that before) which seems to contradict the whole
movie.  Well the first hour anyway.  Murphy's character, who's such a dreary
loser, somehow manages to convince us early on that his primary concern in a
hostage situation is to save innocent lives.  However, when he gives chase to
the overacting villain, at least 100 people must get killed, maimed, or
severely injured.</P>
<P>That calls attention to the tone of this movie.  Do not attend this film if
you are looking for a good time time at the movies.  "Metro" is loud,
unpleasant, dreary, and most of all, completely humorless.  Funnyman Eddie
Murphy decided not to be funny this time.  There is one joke in the first
hour, and its the Redd Foxx joke that's in every preview.  His character is
so drab and unlikable, I just can't figure why he would want to follow-up
the success he had with "The Nutty Professor" with such an unoriginal,
lifeless, brainless, disaster of a movie.  It's not like the man is
untalented, he just keeps picking one bad project after another.  I will
sincerely be shocked if "Metro" becomes a hit.</P>
