<PRE>THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Some actresses are known for their gorgeous looks, others for
their intelligence, some for their homeliness, and still others for
their toughness.  The trait that Jennifer Aniston, last seen in the
delightful but underappreciated PICTURE PERFECT, conjures up on the big
screen is her inherent likeableness.  With her breezy smile and happy
demeanor, she looks like someone who would attract friends like bees to
honey.</P>
<P>     In THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION, Aniston's character, Nina Borowski,
seems to have it all, or close to it.  Her sister, played by Allison
Janney, who was last seen dallying with the governor in PRIMARY COLORS,
is married to a rich New York publisher.  As the publisher, Alan Alda
gives a boisterous, comedic performance as a consummate namedropper
(Mailer, Spielberg, Stone, Hussein, …).</P>
<P>     Although Nina's relatives have just the right up-and-coming man
for her, she's happy being a social worker in one of New York's poorer
boroughs.  Her oppressive fiance, played with a likable unlikeableness
by John Pankow, is a dyed-in-the-wool liberal who sings a union
organizer's song to newborn babies.  That they are all wrong for each
other is as clear as the picture's crystal clean air as filmed by
Oliver Stapleton.</P>
<P>     Into her life comes a prince charming named George Hanson and
played delightfully by Paul Rudd from CLUELESS.  There is, however, one
small problem.  George is a quite happy gay man.  Quite innocently, he
moves into the spare room in Nina's walkup apartment.  Soon they are
taking ballroom dancing lessons to scratchy old records at the local
senior center.  And they go to the movies together, eat out together,
and lie in bed holding each other while watching old movies.</P>
<P>     With Wendy Wasserstein's script holding a virtual neon heart over
their heads, it seems obvious that Nina will want to ditch her fiance
and take up full-time with the guy she not only loves but gets along
with as well.</P>
<P>     The beauty of the story is that it takes so many unexpected
detours and side-trips.  The dialog, however, too often ends up
sounding flat and stagy.  ("We're too old to settle for a twin-bedded
friendship." and "I'm simple, that's why I teach first grade.")  After
the film's midway point, when it makes a switch from romantic comedy to
romantic tragedy, the poignant lines are more sharply drawn.  "Have you
noticed that you're the only practicing heterosexual at your
Thanksgiving dinner?" a famous theater critic, played by Nigel
Hawthorne, points out to Nina.  She laments that she hasn't practiced
in some time.</P>
<P>     Director Nicholas Hytner, whose last film was the poorly received
THE CRUCIBLE, paces the show too languidly and dulls most of the
emotional punches with the result being a film bordering too often on
blandness when its strength is its risk taking.  The ending is crispy
written and staged with great power.  But then they turn around and
give us a feel good Hollywood epilogue that ties up the loose ends all
too neatly and, in some cases, quite unconvincingly.  Don't say I
didn't warn you if you end up suffering a sugar high from those last
few moments.</P>
<P>     THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION runs 1:51.  It is rated R for
profanity, some sexuality and brief drug usage and would be fine for
teenagers.</P>
