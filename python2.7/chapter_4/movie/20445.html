RAIN WITHOUT THUNDER
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>As those familiar with off-topic flame wars on the Usenet
know by now, very few political issues can be as divisive
and emotionally charged as the issue of abortion. This is
especially the case in USA, with the never ending abortion
debate escalating into acts of violence which, if we are to
believe some analysts, could turn into civil war in a
foreseeable future. Of course, debate of such magnitude
spilled over on the screens, sometimes with mediocre
(CITIZEN RUTH), bad (Schloendorf's screen adaptation of
HANDMAID'S TALE) and sometimes with good results (IF THESE
WALLS COULD TALK by Nancy Savoca and Cher). The best film
among them, RAIN WITHOUT THUNDER, 1992 drama by Gary
Bennett, is probably the least known of them all.</P>
<P>Same as in Margaret Attwood's novel HANDMAID TALE, the plot
of this film is set in the near future and it extrapolates
some present-day trends. The year is 2042. Many years ago
"pro life" conservatives managed to win their fight, change
US Constitution and thus enable legislatures to outlaw
abortions. Allison Goldring (played by Ali Thomas) and her
mother Beverly Goldring (Betty Buckley) are serving prison
sentences under Unborn Child Kidnaping Act, after trying to
evade abortion laws by perfoming operation in Sweden.
Reporter (played by Carolyn McCormick) is following the
story and through the interviews with the people who are
familiar with the case, as well as with different
politicians, clergymen and other celebrities, we are
introduced to the future America where the concept of
women's abortion rights is laughable.</P>
<P>While the author of this film, like the authors of almost
all other films with the same subject, takes liberal "pro
choice" stand, RAIN WITHOUT THUNDER is hardly a propaganda
movie. On the contrary, using the mock documentary style to
portray bleak distopic future, allows viewers to draw their
own conclusions. Not only that, this film shows "pro life"
America as still democratic country - with the people being
able to speak freely and have different points of view. RAIN
WITHOUT THUNDER also suggests, unlike Attwood's novel (the
novel got nod by the film-makers in the form of future
"Attwood Society"), that the "pro life" regime would be
introduced gradually and democratically. "Pro lifers" are
given the chance to explain their views and extrapolate on
the practical implementation of those views. What makes this
film very scary (at least for "pro choice" viewers) is the
fact that many times their arguments make perfect sense -
instead of gun-wielding fanatics and religious maniacs, they
are presented as down-to-Earth politicians, lawyers and
bureaucrats.</P>
<P>Of course, this film still isn't perfect. The world, if we
don't count some new and exotic slang words didn't change
much in fifty years. The fashions and technology is the
same, and film didn't try to explain why USA became
non-abortion country, and other countries (like Sweden)
didn't. Some plot developments in the last part of the
movie, although plausible, seem too melodramatic. And the
last nightmare scene was hardly necessary - the authors had
already made their point. But, despite those flaws, RAIN
WITHOUT THUNDER is still a rarity among American movies in
last few years - a film with intriguing, socially important
subject, and in the same time intelligent, ingenious and
thought-provoking.</P>
