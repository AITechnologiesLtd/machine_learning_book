<P>     It's a curious thing that the best 1995 adaptation of a Jane Austen 
book happens to be of her worst novel.  SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was the 
author's first published work and, as is often the case with early 
writing efforts, displays an undeniable shallowness:  themes are half-
developed, characterization is uneven, and plotting follows a 
predictable straight-forwardness.  Austen's later books, including 
PERSUASION, which was developed into a wonderfully sumptuous film 
earlier this year, and EMMA, which received unusual treatment in 
CLUELESS, plumb the human soul far more deeply, creating characters and 
situations of greater versatility and vitality.  </P>
<P>     That's more in the nature of literary criticism than a film review, 
however.  SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is a wonderful motion picture, even 
given the weaknesses of the source material.  Emma Thompson's screenplay 
has remained faithful to the events and spirit of the book, while 
somehow managing to plug a few holes and infuse the tale with more light 
humor than is evident in Austen's original text.  The resulting product 
is a little too long (one-hundred thirty-five minutes), but still 
represents a fine time at the movies, especially for those with a bent 
towards historical romantic melodramas.</P>
<P>     As mentioned above, the story isn't all that complex or surprising, 
and those unfamiliar with Austen's work won't be left in the dark.  
We're introduced to the three Dashwood sisters:  Elinor (Emma Thompson), 
the eldest -- a old maid past marriageable age who keeps her emotions 
bottled up in favor of a constant show of public decorum; Marianne (Kate 
Winslet), the middle child, who is Elinor's opposite in temperament and 
attitude; and Margaret (Emilie Francois), an eleven-year old who seems 
to be following in Marianne's uninhibited footsteps.  The girls live 
with their mother (Gemma Jones) in a small country cottage to which they 
are "exiled" after their half-brother inherits their father's estate and 
decides there's not enough room for everyone.</P>
<P>     During the course of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, three men come in and 
out of the Dashwoods' home:  Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant), a charming, if 
somewhat inept, young gentleman who captures Elinor's heart; Colonel 
Brandon (Alan Rickman), a gallant neighbor who is hopelessly smitten by 
Marianne; and the dashing Willoughby (Greg Wise), who is the living 
embodiment of Marianne's every fantasy.  The story of who ends up with 
whom, and how they get that way, is told with deft skill and a 
pleasantly humorous romantic touch.</P>
<P>     As is so often the case in British productions, acting is more 
important than the script or the impressive production values.  Emma 
Thompson's Elinor can join the actresses' characters from HOWARDS END, 
THE REMAINS OF THE DAY, and this year's CARRINGTON as examples of top-
notch, finely-nuanced performances.  Here, perhaps borrowing a leaf from 
Anthony Hopkins, she develops a poignant portrait of a woman who must 
conceal a broken heart beneath a proper, civilized exterior.  Thompson, 
who has never before played a character suffering from this kind of 
repression, proves she's as good at this as she is being the freespirit.</P>
<P>     Kate Winslet, who received her first international exposure through 
HEAVENLY CREATURES, fits perfectly into the period setting, recalling a 
younger Helena Bonham Carter.  Her youth and energy are perfect for the 
overly-emotional Marianne.  Winslet isn't as accomplished as Thompson at 
capturing the camera's attention, but rarely is she completely eclipsed, 
either.  She interacts effectively with her co-star as Marianne and 
Elinor learn from each other when it's best to temper emotions and when 
it's best to let them go.</P>
<P>     As expected, the supporting cast is excellent.  Emilie Francois is 
a marvelous find as little Margaret.  Hugh Grant brings his usual boyish 
charm to Edward, and Alan Rickman (DIE HARD), too often pigeonholed into 
villainous roles, shows for the first time since TRULY, MADLY, DEEPLY 
that he's very much at home in a romantic part.  Greg Wise is suitably 
roguish, and veterans Gemma Jones (FEAST OF JULY), Harriet Walter 
(Harriet Vane in TV's LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERIES), and Robert Hardy 
(MARY SHELLY'S FRANKENSTEIN) give personality to characters with less 
screen exposure.</P>
<P>     The novel's flaws guarantee that SENSE AND SENSIBILITY cannot be a 
perfect motion picture, but it would be difficult, I think, to do much 
better with the material than Emma Thompson and director Ang Lee (EAT 
DRINK MAN WOMAN) have here.  With more Jane Austen on the way (versions 
of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and EMMA), it's still too early to say which 
adaptation will stand out as the best, but SENSE AND SENSIBILITY makes a 
strong case.</P>
