<PRE>                                 LOTTO LAND
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     There's a whole lotto lovin' goin' on in LOTTO LAND, an odd little
feature from writer/director John Rubino, which explores relationships
among young and old folks in Brooklyn, particularly Lotto players.</P>
<P>     Hank (Larry Gilliard, Jr.) and Joy (Barbara Gonzalez) are about to
embark on prom night.  Hank's father Milt (blues legend Wendell Holmes)
rediscovers long-extinguished passion with Joy's guardian Nini (Suzanne
Costallos).  Oh, and Joy's drunken, roller-skating, drug-dealing father
just may have won $27 million in the New York Lottery.  Trust me, it's not
as complicated as it sounds...or as interesting.</P>
<P>     Basically just a talky drama, LOTTO LAND has a heart of gold but is
as lifeless as overcooked spaghetti.  Yawns were much more common than any
laughs at the screening.  The acting is workmanlike, and the plot is
predictable, but the movie's intentions--to tell a story of purity,
romance, redemption, and modern-day chivalry--are so noble you can't help
but smile and say, "How cute...."</P>
<P>     Cute--that's the sum of it.  The film never gets off the ground at
all, and it seems Rubino is more intent on getting playing time for the
blues musicians (including Holmes) on his soundtrack.  (To be fair, the
tunes are pretty good.)  As a result, the movie just meanders in the
undeveloped storyline and finishes up with an appropriate yet totally
unfulfilling conclusion.  Ho hum, no jackpot this time.</P>
