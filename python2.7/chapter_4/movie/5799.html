<P>     1988.  New York City, overrun by crime, is walled in.  It becomes 
the world's largest, most uncontrolled prison, with the inmates 
prevented from escaping by armed guards who man the walls twenty-four 
hours a day.  Those confined within the city are free to live and die as 
they please, creating their own form of government, choosing their 
leaders, and using guile, brutality, and criminal ingenuity to survive.  
The city's world-renowned silhouette, gazed upon from the shores of 
Liberty Island, is familiar, but, without electricity to light up the 
nights, it has become dark and ominous, like the fledgling society 
growing in its streets, alleyways, and sewers.</P>
<P>     Skip ahead nine years to 1997.  The U.S. President's plane, 
hijacked by terrorists, goes down in the midst of the New York City 
prison.  Master criminal Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell), whose chief 
personality traits are a dry wit and an unrivaled sense of self-
preservation, is chosen to enter New York, rescue the President, and get 
out again.  To insure his cooperation, he is injected with tablets that 
have a twenty-four hour life span.  If Snake hasn't done his job by 
then, his head will explode.  So, left without options, he dons a James 
Bond wristband, hops in a glider, and heads for the top of the World 
Trade Center.</P>
<P>     ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK has one of the most ingenious premises of any 
film released during the 1980s.  For this, if nothing else, director 
John Carpenter (HALLOWEEN, STARMAN) deserves some credit.  
Unfortunately, too much of the film's promise goes unfulfilled.  ESCAPE 
FROM NEW YORK isn't really science fiction -- it's an action flick set 
in a futuristic setting.  Epic potential for a masterful, gripping tale 
is abandoned in favor of cheap thrills.</P>
<P>     Action films have certainly come along way in the last fifteen 
years.  In comparison to a DIE HARD, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK has such a low 
level of excitement that it could almost be considered plodding.  
Carpenter peppers the film with bursts of action, but there are long, 
sometimes sluggish, pauses in between.  Also, surprisingly (since 
Carpenter is known as a "master of suspense"), ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK 
rarely generates much tension, and, when it does, it fails to sustain 
it.  Even the big finale, which involves a chase across a mined bridge, 
doesn't really get the adrenaline pumping.  From an action/adventure 
standpoint, describing this film as anything better than adequate would 
be an unwarranted kindness.</P>
<P>     Apologists for ESCAPE (and there are mass legions of devoted fans) 
point out that the film is as much a comedy as it is an action film.  
And, while it's certainly true that Carpenter has infused the film with 
elements of irony and wit, his sense of humor is so dour that it rarely 
sparks more than fitful laughter.  In fact, it's easier to recognize 
that ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK is trying to be funny than it is to actually 
unearth those few moments of comedy that appear more inspired than 
pointless.</P>
<P>     One area that doesn't merit criticism is the film's look.  Although 
shot on a modest budget of $7 million, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK has the 
appearance of a more expensive picture.  The skyline scenes of 1997 New 
York are very impressive.  Matte artists, set designers, model makers, 
and animators all deserve credit for creating a believably futuristic, 
decadent cityscape.  Cinematographer Dean Cundey gets a lot of nice, 
atmospheric shots that go a long way towards atoning for the film's 
faults.  Carpenter's simple score, which is electronically synthesized, 
is the perfect audio accompaniment to some of the more ominous visuals 
(like the scene where the crazies emerge from the New York underground 
to close in on Snake, recalling George Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING 
DEAD).</P>
<P>     Kurt Russell is delightful as Snake.  The actor, known at the time 
for his Disney films, makes a better-than-average action hero, 
incorporating aspects of Clint Eastwood's spaghetti western personality 
into his character.  The presence of veteran actor Lee Van Cleef (FOR A 
FEW DOLLARS MORE, THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY), who appears to be 
enjoying himself enormously, reinforces the Eastwood comparisons.  
Donald Pleasence, Adrienne Barbeau, and Harry Dean Stanton turn in solid 
supporting performances.  Ernest Borgnine does a wonderful turn as a New 
York cabby who still remembers the old days, and Isaac Hayes is 
deliciously nasty as the Duke.  Stealing perhaps every scene he's in, 
however, is Frank Doubleday, whose turn as a bit player is so 
exaggerated and over-the-top that it's impossible not to notice him.</P>
<P>     So, considering all aspects of the production, what is ESCAPE FROM 
NEW YORK?  A failed science fiction spectacle that devolves into a 
mediocre action/comedy?  Or an underrated cult classic that functions as 
a ground-breaking adventure film?  Perhaps, as is so often the case, the 
truth lies somewhere in between.  ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK is definitely 
watchable, and, at times, quite enjoyable.  However, when the final 
credits roll, you can be forgiven a vague sense of dissatisfaction, 
because the creativity that went into formulating the premise was never 
extended to the script writing stage.</P>
