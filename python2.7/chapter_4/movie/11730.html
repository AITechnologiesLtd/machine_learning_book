<PRE>                         GREAT EXPECTATIONS 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
             1 :-)  for a merry ending, but Dickens it ain't</PRE>
<P>Cast: Ethan Hawke, Gwyneth Paltrow, Anne Bancroft, Robert DeNiro, Chris
Cooper, Hank Azaria, Raquel Beaudene, Jeremy Kissner
Director: Alfonso Cuaron
Producer: Art Linson
Screenplay: Mitch Glazer based on the novel by Charles Dickens</P>
<P>When one thinks of GREAT EXPECTATIONS, one thinks of Pip not Finn; Miss
Havisham who incinerates herself in her wedding dress, not a remorseful
Ms Dinsmoor who regrets what she has done; a vindictive, cold Estella
who is unable to love and mostly an unhappy ending.</P>
<P> The original story may have been a miserable tale about an orphan and a
bratty girl, but that's how Dickens wanted it. Recreating Dickens 90's
style is a dangerous thing. Can we safely say that this is still
Dickens?</P>
<P>Although the jist of the story is much the same, there are elements
which make this story subtly different. Minor annoyances like how Finn's
sister sleeps around then leaves them. A seductive Estella who
eventually mellows into a human being and the implication that Finn and
Estella fall in love in the end, may be enough to make Dickens turn in
his grave. It is as ludicrous as rewriting ROMEO AND JULIET so they live
happily ever after, then still calling it Shakespeare!</P>
<P>If this story were not so closely tied with Dickens, then perhaps it
would not be receiving such harsh criticism. Ethan Hawke is a
charismatic actor and good in his role as Finn, although better in
GATTACA. The seductive Estella, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, works the
camera with looks that could kill. Anne Bancroft is delightful as the
eccentric Ms Dinsmoor, reminiscent of Gloria Swanson in SUNSET
BOULEVARD. Whilst Robert De Niro's puts in a heartfelt performance as
the escaped convict who brings fortune to the young Finn.</P>
<P>Playing around with classical literature is a dangerous thing,
especially if you're going to change the ending.</P>
