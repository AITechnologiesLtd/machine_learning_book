<PRE>                               MAGNOLIA
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Paul Thomas Anderson's film is much
          in the style of Robert Altman's SHORT CUTS.  We
          follow several tangentially connected story lines.
          Anderson has many of his usual familiar faces
          present and he does some unusual experiments with
          pacing.  While the stories are all compelling
          disappointingly none of them really resolves
          satisfactorily in the end.  Anderson wants to give
          the entire film a bizarre tone, but he is only
          partially successful.  Rating: 7 (0 to 10), low +2
          (-4 to +4)  In the spoiler section after the main
          review is a heavy spoiler discussing the film's
          strangest plot point.</PRE>
<P>     In INTOLERANCE, D. W. Griffith told four different historical
stories at the same time, cutting from one to the other.  Each of the
stories builds to a fast-paced climax.  In MAGNOLIA, Paul Thomas
Anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the
others.  Yet the stories and where they are going are all independent.
What is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized.
Each story builds to a tense moment (or what appears to be intended to
be a tense moment) but then lets the tension dissolve.  While the
tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each
plotline the major characters sing along, even though they are not in
the same scene.  Then toward the end the stories each build to a tense
moment again.  It is almost as if the characters are somehow
psychically linked.  This creates some strange effects.  The stories
are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships.  The
strands have varying degrees of bizarre content.  We have the story of
a dying man Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) wanting to get in touch with
his son and make amends.  Phil Parma (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is his
nurse who is frantic to help Partridge achieve his final goal.
Partridge's young wife Linda (Julianne Moore) is getting more and more
anxious as Partridge dies, but for an unsuspected reason.  Frank Mackey
(Tom Cruise) runs the kinds of self-help seminar that businesses like
so much, but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real
shit-heels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to women's lib.
Officer Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) is a patrolman who has a need to
feel he is making the world a better place.  Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker
Hall) hosts a popular children's TV quiz show that really exploits and
destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid
Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman) and former quiz kid Donnie Smith
(William H. Macy).  The film juggles all these stories for over three
hours, but even after all this time not one story is resolved
satisfactorily.  Each story moves toward a single bizarre common
climax, but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story.
The common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to
really tie up any of the stories.  The film seems to be built around
strange events and weird history, but it really has little to do with
the content of the stories, though they all are connected in part by
one weird event.</P>
<P>     MAGNOLIA will probably bring some much deserved attention to Paul
Thomas Anderson, though in my opinion his two previous films, HARD
EIGHT and BOOGIE NIGHTS were better told stories.  It is interesting
that one starts to look forward to actors from Anderson's company.
John C. Reilly seems to be a standard fixture.  Particularly notable is
Philip Baker Hall who gave a mesmerizing performance from the first
scene of HARD EIGHT.  Here he several of the characters are
mesmerizing, but that characteristic is not really used.</P>
<P>     As studies of characters these stories are each worth following.
As well-rounded stories with a beginning, middle and end, they leave
something to be desired.  But the film is willing to do the unexpected
and that helps make the film worth sitting through.  I rate it a 7 on
the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<PRE>     Heavy spoiler... Heavy spoiler... Heavy spoiler... Heavy
spoiler...</PRE>
<P>     During the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple
messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does
happen.  And in actual fact, it does.  Since Biblical times rains of
frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods.  It
is, however, a perfectly natural, if somewhat unnerving, phenomenon.
The cause is associated with whirlwinds.  We know that tornadoes over
land can rip up land and even objects of some size from the ground and
hurl them into the air, holding them aloft.  The reader may remember
the unfortunate cow in TWISTER.  Smaller objects can be hurled high
into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft by the updrafts for
surprisingly long periods of time much as hail and chunks of ice are.
When the whirlwind is over water, animals near the surface, frequently
fish and frogs, may suffer the same fate.  Essentially they are
vacuumed up by the whirlwind, held aloft by updrafts, and finally
dropped elsewhere.</P>
<P>     So while the rain is possible, some doubts do creep in.  The rain
of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than I had
pictured for a rain of frogs.  It seems unlikely the frogs would still
be alive when dropped.  It is not clear that geographic conditions are
right for Los Angeles to have this sort of phenomenon.  (Frankly I have
no idea on these points.)  Otherwise the event was quite believable.
What we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomena we
saw in VOLCANO.</P>
<P>     In the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is a sign from God
since there are many references to Exodus 8:2. "And the frogs shall
come up both on thee and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants."
However a rain of frogs, though it feels Biblical, is most definitely
NOT a Biblical portent.  Note that the previous verse says "And the
river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up...," so the
Bible is referring not to a rain but to an infestation from the river.
The only other reference to frogs in the Bible is as a symbol for
uncleanness in Revelation 16:13.</P>
