<P>     There's a fundamental problem with the two principle characters
writer David Mamet drops into his wilderness adventure THE EDGE.  Charles
Morse (Anthony Hopkins) is a multimillionaire businessman who accompanies
his wife, a model named Mickey (Elle Macpherson), on a location shoot in
the Arctic; Bob (Alec Baldwin) is the fashion photographer who seems a bit
too interested in his subject.  When a plane crash leaves Charles, Bob and
an assistant named Steve (Harold Perrineau) stranded miles from
civilization, the three men are forced to work together, use their wits
and overcome their antagonisms in order to survive.</P>
<P>     That should have been the idea, anyway.  THE EDGE is a wilderness
adventure which also wants to be a psychological drama, but forgets to
develop a convincing conflict between the two leads.  In fact, there are
precious few screen minutes of any kind between Charles and Bob before the
are stuck together.  The rivalry over Mickey is clearly meant as the main
grudge between them, but that conflict doesn't develop until quite late in
the film.  For the most part, antagonism between Charles and Bob is
presented as a given.  After all, there's a beautiful woman involved, envy
of wealth, stressful situations...what's not to be antagonistic over?</P>
<P>     For one thing, the situations aren't all that stressful, thanks to an
inherent lack of tension in the characters.  On the one hand there's Bob,
who proves to be a poor choice of roles for Alec Baldwin.  Baldwin can be
as menacing as they come when he's allowed to swagger a bit; Bob, however,
is generally too dim to be much of a challenge to Charles, or much of a
help to their mutual survival.  Charles, on the other hand, turns out to
be as filthy smart as he is filthy rich.  Every trivial piece of
information he has ever read has become part of his photographic memory,
making him a walking encyclopedia of primitive anthropology, basic
physics, first aid, forestry, engineering and alternative cures for
side-aches.  As you watch Charles fashion a compass from a magnetized pin
and a floating leaf, or construct a squirrel trap from bent twigs, or go
fishing with a thread from his sweater and a watch fob, you get the
distinct impression that you're watching a portrait of MacGyver as an
older man.  There's no reason to be worried about whether Charles will
make it.  He can do anything, and he knows it.</P>
<P>     And it's too bad that there isn't more drama to the characters in THE
EDGE, because in concept and execution it's often a thrilling adventure.
Director Lee Tamahori (ONCE WERE WARRIORS) crafts some fine action
sequences, notably those involving the survivors' ongoing battle with a
mythically persistent man-eating bear.  As photographed by Donald
McAlpine, THE EDGE is a satisfying experience both visually and
viscerally.</P>
<P>     Intellectually, it's an ambitious disappointment.  Stories set in the
wild usually assume that returning to a state of nature is the only way a
human can survive away from civilization, which makes it refreshing to
find a story which assumes that reason is an even more effective survival
tool.  It's particularly surprising that the writer is Mamet, who has been
known to have his characters turn animalistic while sitting at a desk.
(Which isn't to say that you can't spot a bit of cynicism creeping in --
it's hard to believe that he named his supermodel character "Mickey Morse"
by accident).  But THE EDGE isn't exactly about people forced to live by
their wits.  It's about one man who treats Arctic survival as a routine
open-book test, while a more simple-minded classmate cribs from his
answers.</P>
<PRE>    On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 bear necessities:  5.</PRE>
