<P>   Here on Manhattan island where I see virtually all of my
films, "Croupier" is playing at only one movie house--which
speaks novels about what studios consider the taste of even
the sophisticated moviegoing public of New York.  U-571, a
well-made techno-thriller which the NY Times critic astutely
calls a movie "without a brain in its head" and one suitable
for "kids," is sending people to the box office with the 
speed of a torpedo.  "Croupier" on the other hand is one of
those noir films that might be called a sleeper, perhaps
because of insufficient marketing--a gamble its producers
were afraid to make.</P>
<P>   Featuring a cast of first-rate performers largely unknown to
an American audience, the picture is directed by Mike
Hodges, whose "Get Carter" back in 1970 is (like his current
feature) a lean drama--one featuring Michael Caine as a
small-time gangster investigating his brother's death.  Though
the 68-year-old British director's output has been meager, his
"Get Carter" and his "Croupier" demonstrate his taste for
realistic action and technical pizazz.</P>
<P>   Employing a technique used by playwright Eugene O'Neill
in his experimental work "Strange Interlude," Hodges has his
title character narrate his thoughts, allowing us to get to know
him better.  At several points in this fast-moving melodrama,
Jack Manfred (Clive Owen) would make comments to his girl
friend Marion (Gina McKee), to his dad (Nicholas Ball), and to
the sexy South African gambler Jani de Villiers (Alex
Kingston), only to subvert his remarks with wry, narrative
reflections.  Through Jack's inner musings and outward
commentary, we learn not only quite a bit about this
fascinating person but receive abundant information about the
goings-on of gaming casinos in much the way that "Airport"
instructs us about the world of the airline industry.</P>
<P>   Jack Manfred, who is in virtually every scene, is at heart a
writer who is blocked because, being jobless, he seems to
have nothing to write about.  His inspiration comes when he
takes employment as a croupier, or casino operator, a gig
which he father urges him to grab given the young man's
inability to make a go behind his laptop.  Showing a natural
ability to manipulate a deck of cards, he is hired by a London
casino owner who likes what he sees.  Jack himself never
gambles, choosing to get his kicks not from winning or, as
some psychologists hold, by self-destructively losing, but by
watching his customers forfeit their shirts.  He recognizes that
the odds always favor the house and is particularly
bewildered by his girl friend's custom of buying lottery tickets
despite the odds of 42 million to one.</P>
<P>   Hodges' picture possesses the elements of the noir genre,
including a femme fatale, an eternal cigarette in the mouth of
its protagonist, and filming that takes place almost exclusively
at night or in indoor spaces.  Most of all, "Croupier" is an
exercise in cynicism, featuring a plot with a wonderful
surprise ending that proves that nice guys often lose, adding
that a solid sense of humor can go a long way toward
alleviating the damage.  Clive Owen is made for the role. 
With hair dyed black and a tuxedo that fits him like his own
skin, Owen could be the next James Bond--except that in his
current role he is even more detached than his fictional fellow
countryman, too wound up with inner debates and exploited
vulnerabilities.  "Croupier" is a thriller without car chases or
explosions which works as an intense, swiftly-paced winner.
The picture lets us in on as much as we need to know about
a novelist whose losing life undergoes a radical change after
he takes a job that most people of his station would never
consider.</P>
