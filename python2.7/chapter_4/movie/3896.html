<P>     How does the world view Australia?  For that matter, how do 
Australians view their own country?  HOTEL SORRENTO, a thoughtful and 
nicely acted (if occasionally pedantic) motion picture, attempts to 
answer this question, among others.  But the real meat of the story is 
the examination of the dynamics of yet another dysfunctional family -- 
the ties that bind them and the buried secrets that rip them apart. </P>
<P>     The three Moynihan sisters couldn't be more different.  There's 
Hilary (Caroline Gilmer), the oldest, who has remained in Australia with 
their aging father, raising a son alone after the death of her husband.  
Meg (Caroline Goodall), the middle sister, has dusted the dirt of 
Australia from her feet and moved to England, where she lives with a 
British husband and has authored a critically praised novel called 
MELANCHOLY.  Pippa (Tara Morice) is the youngest, a high-spirited 
advertising exec who lives and works in America, but has returned to her 
homeland with the promise of bringing submarine sandwich franchises to 
the Antipodes. </P>
<P>     Although the three interact civilly, and occasionally show signs of 
compassion and even affection, it's clear that something is rotten at 
the core of the three-pronged relationship.  The biggest strain is 
between Meg and Pippa, who often appear on the verge of doing physical 
harm to each other.  Though occasionally melodramatic, the unfolding of 
family secrets and the revelation of how they have poisoned the sisters' 
relationship gives HOTEL SORRENTO its momentum. </P>
<P>     Of less interest are the political dissertations about how 
Australia has modernized during the past ten years, shedding its love of 
the static and embracing a willingness to change.  Some of the dialogue, 
which aspires to the level of that of French writer/director Eric 
Rohmer, ends up more pretentious than insightful, and several of the 
conversations go on for longer than they probably should. </P>
<P>     Nevertheless, despite missteps, it's the dialogue, with all of its 
philosophical musings and politically-charged wrangling, that 
differentiates HOTEL SORRENTO from the more common family dramas.  The 
problem is that some of the time devoted to abstract arguments might 
have been focused on more fully fleshing out the emotional elements.  By 
the end of the picture, there are still several noticeable holes that 
need plugging.  Director Richard Franklin succeeds in tying together 
politics and the Moynihan family, but never completely explores each 
sister's pain to the extent where this dimension of the relationship 
contributes effectively to the film's overall impact.  HOTEL SORRENTO is 
a pleasant, atmospheric film seeking to paint a comprehensive socio-
political portrait that it never quite gets on the canvas. </P>
