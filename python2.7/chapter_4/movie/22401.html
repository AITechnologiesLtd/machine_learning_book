<PRE>"The Talented Mr. Ripley" (1999)</PRE>
<P>Directed by Anthony Minghella
Written by Anthony Minghella
Starring Matt Damon, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett, Jack Davenport,
Philip Seymour Hoffman, Philip Baker Hall, and James Renhorn.</P>
<PRE>Grade: **** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>The last movie I reviewed was Milos Forman's "Man on the Moon." Jim Carrey
fabulously portrayed the mysterious comedian Andy Kaufman as a character who
was a master at becoming anything but himself. Due to the ambuguity of
Kaufman's persona, people were forced to make up for themselves who he actually
was. "The Talented Mr. Ripley's" Tom Ripley is a character with the same
chameleon-like ability of transforming himself into whatever he pleases.
However, he does not let those he encounters decide who he is, instead he
judges for himself what people should believe and know. Although Kaufman and
Ripley are quite similar, the movies they star in are far from that. While "Man
on the Moon" relies on the comedic talents of Carrey to entertain the audience,
"The Talented Mr. Ripley" is a grim analysis of civilization in the 1950's
which contains elements of trust and deception. When these two adjectives go
together in the description of a film, it is expected that tragic chaos will
erupt from the combination and strong feelings will develop for the victims and
doers. The result of Anthony Minghella's masterpiece is certainly that as
eruptions frequently occur during the fabulously suspenseful plot. The film
throws its audience around with unique plot twists during every scene creating
a thrilling unpredictable atmosphere. </P>
<P>The story  follows the adventures of Tom Ripley (played chillingly well by Matt
Damon) who finds himself on a journey to Italy where he is being paid to try to
convince a young man, Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law in a breakthrough performance)
to return to America. Once he arrives, Ripley finds he is greatly attracted to
Greenleaf's style of life. He becomes so obsessed with Greenleaf that
eventually his desires take over his morality. "The Talented Mr. Ripley" is a
presentation of several classes from the snobby, selfish rich American to lower
class Italians. Its wide range of analysis rather than just on Ripley makes it
more interesting and disturbing in how social structure creates people.
However, Ripley's obsession is the central point and for good reason. This
villain is very unique because the majority of the public watching the movie
can relate to him more than any other character. We all know that what he is
doing is sick and wrong but for some reason we understand why he is doing it.
Bonding with Ripley is what makes the film so frightening. </P>
<P>Both the script and the directing are responsible for non stop tension. The
dialogue written by Minghella is so fresh and engaging that the film's 160
minute running time seems to fly right by. When one segment of the film begins
to drag on too long, the film quickly shifts to a newer, fresher scene. Some
very memorable lines and some clever sexual references make this one of the
best scripts written this year, if not this decade. The directing also is
flawless. Minghella was most likely influenced by Alfred Hitchcock, from his
"Psycho"-like format for the opening credits to his very effective ability of
spinning the camera to a point of near dizziness like that of "Vertigo."
Minghella shows that without special effects a film can still be frightening. </P>
<P>Anthony Minghella utilizes the skills of each actor (most of them Academy Award
winners) perfectly. Damon is superb as Ripley. Hidden behind some thick
glasses, he looks harmless but once he is overtaken by desire his face
completely transforms to a harsh coldness. Jude Law, who has given some decent
supporting performances in films such as "eXitenZ" and "Gattaca", takes a
surprisingly perfect turn as Dickie Greenleaf. As a snobby, rich kid who hates
America, its hard to like him but it's even harder to hate him and to see him
suffer from Ripley's wrath. His performance was accurate in creating mixed
emotions for his character. Gwyneth Paltrow was also great as Greenleaf's
suspicious girlfriend, Marge. Marge starts off a bit slow and underdeveloped
but as the film continues Paltrow is given the chance to bloom and she does.
Other supporting actors also contribute their talents such as Philip Seymour
Hoffman as one of Greenleaf's friends. Hoffman is beginning to dominate
Hollywood as he appears in three movies currently out in theaters and thanks to
his talents gives three great performances. </P>
<P>The script, the direction, the acting; all are top notch in this thriller that
plays with your mind by playing with the characters' minds. From the very first
scene to the very last, "The Talented Mr. Ripley" is perfection.</P>
