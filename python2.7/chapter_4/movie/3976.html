<PRE>                               THE POSTMAN
                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1995 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>     THE POSTMAN is a beautiful, heartbreaking movie about a very
different kind of friendship in an outpost of the old world.  Mario
(Massimo Troisi), the reluctant fisherman in a fishermen's culture,
catches cold every time he sets foot in a boat. He takes a modest job
delivering mail by bicycle to Pablo Neruda (Phillipe Noiret), the
renowned poet living in exile from Chile. Poetry becomes their
connection.</P>
<P>     The friendship of the unlikely pair speaks the sad truth that we
can rarely tell our friends about the inner forces that drive us
through life. Much later, in despair, Mario returns to the poet's house
to revisit the place that had once been alive with the sounds and
sights of emotional discovery.  In the silence that now envelops it,
the loss of joy is simply overwhelming.  It is a wrenching scene.</P>
<P>     Mario has a face of piercing intelligence with sharply angled
cheekbones and the saddest eyes you will ever see. He has fallen in
love with Beatrice, and he turns to the poet, Neruda, for help in
overcoming the halting awkwardness he brings to the courtship. The
friendship between the exalted poet and the postman is sublime, the
sadness of it is unbearable.</P>
<P>     The simple dedication, "To our friend Massimo," is a deeply simple
tribute to Massimo Troisi, the actor who died at 41, one day after
filming ended and just before the surgery he had postponed in order to
finish the film.  Hobbled by illness during the production, he was
driven to deliver this message about heartbreak and friendship. We can
all be grateful that he felt so strongly.</P>
