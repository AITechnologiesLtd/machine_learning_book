<PRE>The Last Days Of Disco
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (Out of ****)</PRE>
<P>All cultures have their mating rituals: a time and place where the eligible
get together to strut their stuff and pick whose stuff they like being
strutted. In many tribal cultures the men drum at a gathering demonstrating
their skills while the women dance for the drummers portraying theirs.</P>
<P>In the urban United States during the late seventies there were few drumming
circles so the twenty-somethings headed to discos to find their mates - even
very temporary ones. Disco music has been often denigrated as mediocre at best
and with good reason. But that's not the point. The music was always only a
means. The scene was the important aspect.</P>
<P>For a group of recent college graduates, the chosen ritual meeting place is a
club never named but obviously modeled after Club 54 where they gather
(assuming that they look cool enough to make it past the doorman) to dance the
night away under flashing lights. Their throbbing rhythms are mechanically
produced but the ritual is still the same.</P>
<P>Alice (Chloe Sevigny) and Charlotte (Kate Beckinsale) attempt to climb the
corporate ladder at a book publisher by day and work the social ladder in the
evenings. At the club they hang with Josh (Matthew Keeslar), an assistant DA;
Jimmy (MacKenzie Astin), a junior advertising executive and Des (Christopher
Eigeman), the club's assistant manager. They make up a fairly tight-knit group
playing together, dancing together and, you guessed it, sleeping together.</P>
<P>Although the film features the expected disco soundtrack, the stars spend
much more time talking than they do dancing. This is no "Saturday Night Live"
featuring stylized gyrations. Here the dancing is decidedly unglamorized
although for a few seconds now and then there is something interesting
happening on the dance floor.</P>
<P>To be blunt, these people lead a shallow existence. Some events in their
lives are exciting (Josh is investigating the club, Jimmy must sneak clients
in, Des has a coke problem and a parade of girlfriends), but they are just
wandering through.</P>
<P>What they mostly do is talk and when they're done, they talk some more.
Although the conversation is witty, the topics are banal. There's a long
discussion deconstructing <I>Lady And The Tramp<I> leading to the conclusion
that the film is why girls go for bad boys. A couple debates the technical
qualifications of virginity reminding me of numerous deliberations I've heard
about sexual activity and which category an evening fell into. "I did this and
he did that. Did we have sex?"</P>
<P>With the arrogance of youth, Charlotte wonders if people really ever danced
in bars before disco. Josh recounts the beginnings of the musical genre with
"Some people don't consider that 'disco' -- because it's good." Being advised
by her critical friend that throwing in the word "sexy" as often as possible
is a good thing, Alice explains to a one-night stand "there's something sexy
about Scrooge McDuck."</P>
<P>They talk about a couple who are cheating on a trial separation by secretly
seeing each other. Charlotte explains how VD isn't all bad because you have to
inform your previous sexual partners leading to renewed possibilities.</P>
<P>Although the conversations are witty and some of the lines priceless, the
intellectualizing about nothing becomes wearing. They are hanging out waiting
for something to happen and eventually the audience is doing the same. One of
the problems with the movie is that when the plot rears its ugly head, there's
not much there. An undercover investigation of the club's finances just gets
in the way of the film.</P>
<P>The actors do a fine job of portraying authentic characters. They're not very
likable people but they are real. Alice is the closest to someone that you'd
want to spend time with but Sevigny's performance is uneven. Occasionally warm
and human, she's so odd and quirky that it's uncomfortable to watch.</P>
<P>The guys are all clones of each other. They look and act so much alike that I
spent half of the film asking my companion which man was which. In fact nearly
everyone on the dance floor looks alike...except the ones that are dressed as
"Wizard Of Oz" characters or in a leopard print outfit or naked.</P>
<P>The only exception is Dan (Matt Ross), a co-worker at the book publisher. A
political activist, he has a distinctive personality. Until, that is, he is
able to get into the club. Then he becomes one more piece of fodder for the scene.</P>
<P>A companion piece to director Whit Stillman's other two films
("Metropolitan", "Barcelona"), the repartee is enjoyable and the look at group
social dynamics is almost enticing, but it would be nice if these people had
something going in their lives. Oh well, they're young and disco is dying so
maybe there's hope.</P>

admit that he actually went to a disco club -- twice. Email your confessions
