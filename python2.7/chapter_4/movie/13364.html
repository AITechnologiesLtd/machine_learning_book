The Mask of Zorro (PG-13) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Despite numerous vehicles designed to break him out of the fold, Antonio
Banderas still remains right on the cusp of major Hollywood stardom.  He
came out with both guns blazing in _Desperado_, yet he didn't exactly blow
away the box office; Rebecca DeMornay literally sunk her teeth into his
naked ass in _Never_Talk_to_Strangers, but he himself came away with
nothing to chew on; he rode Sylvester Stallone's fast-falling coattails in
_Assassins_; no one cared to see how he and his current wife, Melanie
Griffith, met on the job in _Two_Much_.  Now, holding some momentum after
his well-received supporting turn in _Evita_, Banderas has his best--and,
perhaps, last--shot at Tinseltown superstardom, the rousing romantic
adventure _The_Mask_of_Zorro_.</P>
<P>In a season and an age ruled by action films reliant on post-production
effects, the barebones approach of an old fashioned swashbuckler is rather
refreshing.  As this update of Johnston McCulley's enduring character
begins, the legendary masked, sword-wielding defender of the weak and
oppressed is really one Don Diego de la Vega (Anthony Hopkins), aiding
Mexico's independence effort against Spain.  His double life is soon
discovered by the evil Spanish governor Don Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson),
who kills de la Vega's wife Esperanza (Julietta Rosen), throws him in
prison, and claims their infant daughter, Elena, as his own.  Twenty years
later, de la Vega escapes, at roughly the same time Montero returns from
Spain to the now-independent Mexico with the grown Elena (Catherine
Zeta-Jones) in tow.  Montero, of course, has a dirty scheme up his sleeve,
and seeing that he is a bit long in the tooth to reassume the mask of
Zorro, grooms young, scruffy, revenge-minded bandit Alejandro Murieta
(Banderas) to take his place.</P>
<P>Naturally, this sets the stage for extended training sequences, which are
far from anything new but made watchable by some funny repartee written by
scripters John Eskow, Ted Elliot, and Terry Rossio; and the effortless
mentor-student rapport between Hopkins and Banderas.  Unlike some films,
though, while Alejandro pretty much passes his training, he still does not
perfect certain things (namely, horseback riding) which gives this fantasy
some element of reality--and keeps the film from taking itself too
seriously.  It's this lighthearted, light-on-its-feet tone that makes
_Zorro_ such agreeable entertainment.  Director Martin Campbell delivers
the goods in the many exciting swordfights throughout the movie, but he
also displays a nice, breezy touch throughout, particularly in the scene
that received the biggest crowd response: a cute and sexy
swordplay-as-foreplay scene between Alejandro and Elena.</P>
<P>Although the Alejandro-Elena romance is somewhat underwritten, the pairing
comes to life, thanks to palpable chemistry between Banderas and the
breathtaking Zeta-Jones, who share a sensual dance scene midway through the
film.  Actually, Banderas heightens the energy level of every scene he's
in.  He has always been a charismatic screen presence, but he has never
been quite so charmingly roguish and playful, which is perfectly suited to
the character.  Also well-cast is Hopkins, who appears to be having a ball
taking on a more physical role for a change.  Less effective, though, is
the casting of the villains.  Wilson is only slightly more menacing than
the weak brand of villainy he leant _Lethal_Weapon_3_, and Matt Letscher,
playing the military captain who killed Alejandro's brother (hence the new
Zorro's thirst for vengeance), seems no match for the masked swordsman.</P>
<P>While _Armageddon_ and _Lethal_Weapon_4_ pummel moviegoers with mayhem
(and quite effectively, at that), it's almost soothing to watch an action
film as comparatively laid-back as _The_Mask_of_Zorro_.  It is a fairly
relaxed yet confident, competent entertainment, one that is not afraid to
bypass a hard sell and allow its innate charms to elegantly seduce its
audience.</P>
