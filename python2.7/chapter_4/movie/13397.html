<P>Director Joe Dante is darned if he does and darned if he doesn't.  He
was criticized somewhat in 1984 for his fantasy film 'Gremlins' in which
a cute and fuzzy little pack of creatures that sort of resemble a cross
between puppies and bear cubs, became bizarre little trolls if they were
fed after midnight or if they got wet.  For those who haven't seen
'Gremlins', 'Small Soldiers' will do nicely because Dante uses the same
pace, camera lighting effects and elementary school level action climax
that 'Gremlins' had.  Dante's film 'Small Soldiers' is receiving
criticism for many of the mean spirited antics seen in 'Gremlins' while
others are saying that 'Small Soldiers' isn't mean enough to pass as a
convincing movie where danger looks certain for its cast of human
characters</P>
<P>Perhaps appealing to children more than any other target audience,
'Small Soldiers' will undoubtedly inspire an entire line of merchandise
that will pick up where the box office left off.  By now, life in the
1990's is one big marketing blitz where subliminal ads are seen in
movies and audiences better get used to it because it isn't leaving big
screens anytime soon.</P>
<P>In 'Small Soldiers', a toy manufacturing company owned by a corporate
honcho with little human emotion (Denis Leary), is obsessed with the
idea that a proposed new line of toys, in the form of mighty military
men can be built and be so smart that when kids play with them, they can
play back.</P>
<P>The chief designers of the new wonder toys (Jay Mohr and David Cross)
are intimidated by their boss and are determined to satisfy his desire
for these misguided material play things and Mohr orders highly
sophisticated military chips to be implanted in the head of the action
figures.</P>
<P>500,000 units are shipped consisting of two factions.  There are the
soldiers whose leader is Chip Hazard (voiced by Tommy Lee Jones) and his
elite squad of goofy henchmen some of whom are voiced by such veteran
actors as George Kennedy and Ernest Borgnine and there are the
Gorgonites whose leader Archer (voiced by Frank Langella) make for the
best toys as they are docile and peaceful but are the main target of the
military toys for a humourous confrontation later in the film.</P>
<P>The human hero in 'Small Soldiers' is Alan (Gregory Smith), a rather
bland and lifeless young man much like his 'Gremlins' colleague Zach
Galligan and Alan desires the girl next door named Christy (Kirsten
Dunst).  Alan convinces a local delivery man to leave a shipment of the
toys, meant for a rival toy super store, at his father's toy
neighbourhood store so he can sell them and make a little money for the
store which has fallen somewhat on hard times.  The toys get loose and
begin acting up with predictable results.</P>
<P>First of all, 'Small Soldiers' uses some ingeniously clever gags to sell
its shortcomings.  The soldiers put together gadgets made from ordinary
household items such as cheese graters, fishing rods, chain saws and cds
and they power up a collection of female dolls to act as their
counterparts in mischief and some of the attack scenes are really
convincing.  It's a fun film which isn't action packed as much as it is
introductory in its presentation of multiple play things similar to the
many characters seen in 1995's 'Toy Story', although 'Toy Story' is far
superior to this film.  Another thing that 'Small Soldiers' has going
for it is its benign presentation of the film's cartoonish violence
which is tastefully presented and appropriate for children comparable to
a Coyote and Road Runner cartoon where the violence is so absurd, you
know it isn't perceived as reality.</P>
