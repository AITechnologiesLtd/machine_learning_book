<P>     Martha (Debra Winger) is a child in an adult's body.  Mentally and
emotionally disabled, she clings to people and things like a parasite,
and has clear notions of what's right and what's wrong.  Unable to
survive without supervision, she lives with her widowed aunt, Frances
(Barbara Hershey), a wealthy woman who's carrying on an affair with the
assemblyman she's trying to get re-elected (John Terry).  One day,
after the assemblyman's wife (Laurie Metcalf) drives her car through
Frances' porch (she's annoyed at her husband's indiscretion), a little
carpentry work is needed.  Enter Mackey (Gabriel Byrne), a drunken
drifter with a talent for wood who develops an attraction for Martha.</P>
<P>     A DANGEROUS WOMAN is a bleak, dreary drama about the tragic life
of a woman with severe mental and emotional handicaps.  In its present
form, this is one of the least appealing movies of the year.  It's not
especially poorly made, but neither is it a masterpiece of modern film
making.  A DANGEROUS WOMAN has little to hold the viewer's interest,
and its tone is so relentlessly downbeat that, at times, it becomes
unpleasant to watch.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the biggest flaw is characterization.  I never cared about
any of the three principals (Martha, Mackey, and Frances).  None of
them felt real; consequently, their fates were of little concern.  For
the most part, these people are dull and uninteresting, and it's a
major mistake to build a motion picture around them.  Martha is
especially disappointing.  She rings false not because of her
limitations, but because of the manner in which those limitations are
presented.  Everything about them is too obvious (no subtlety).</P>
<P>     The script is more at fault than the actors.  Barbara Hershey and
Gabriel Byre don't excel here, but their performances aren't without
their moments.  Debra Winger has a tendency to go overboard in her
portrayal of Martha, making Mercedes Ruehl's Bella from LOST IN YONKERS
seem understated by comparison.  Some will probably be astounded by
this example of overacting.  Personally, I think Ms. Winger would have
been much more impressive had she applied some restraint.  After the
first few minutes, she becomes annoying.</P>
<P>     The tone and pacing of A DANGEROUS WOMAN are also problematic.
The movie moves along sloooooowly, apparently going nowhere.  When
something actually happens, it's a surprise, but even the "big" events
fail to generate much energy.  The infrequent attempts at humor are
bleak and unfunny, and a few "cute" scenes with Martha generate almost
no emotional response from the audience.</P>
<P>     There is also a huge missed opportunity.  A DANGEROUS WOMAN has a
chance to examine the issue of rape from an unusual perspective.  Down
this avenue lies the path of a potentially potent drama, but just as
the film seems to be headed in the right direction, it takes a detour,
and never gets back on track.  All we're treated to after that is a
mind-numbingly silly conclusion where suddenly everything is bright and
glorious.</P>
<P>     Somewhere in A DANGEROUS WOMAN lies an interesting story.  The
problem is, it's buried under too many layers of dross for more than a
few hints of it to bubble to the surface.  Production-wise, there have
been many movies of far worse quality, but there are few that match
this one for lack of entertainment value.</P>
