<PRE>                                WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY
                       A film review by David N. Butterworth
          Copyright 1997 David N. Butterworth/The Summer Pennsylvanian</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: *** (Maltin scale)</PRE>
<P>Leave it to the French to take an idea as simple as a young woman searching
for her lost cat and turn it into an evocation of life, love, and the big
city.</P>
<P>More specifically, credit first-time writer/director Cedric Klapisch, his
leading actress Garance Clavel, and a fine assortment of non-actors who
give "When the Cat's Away," above all, a true heart.  Oh, and let's not
forget Arapimou who plays Gris-Gris, the missing feline at the center of
this largely improvisational piece, who's credited above most of the real
life performers!</P>
<P>Clavel plays Chloe, a "small, slightly pale brunette who wears tight
jeans."  Twentysomething and sick to the nines of her workaday job as a
makeup artist, Chloe longs for a vacation, but there's a snag--her beloved
cat, Gris-Gris.  No one is willing, or able, to catsit him for the week.
Including her gay roomate, Michel (Olivier Py), who jokingly suggests she
"chuck him out of a car."  Including a friend for whom Chloe watered the
plants at Easter.  In fact, no one.  (If you've ever had pets, you'll
understand the difficulties in offloading them during the holidays.)</P>
<P>Finally Chloe finds relief in the form of a batty old lady, Madame Renee
(Renee LeCalm), who runs a cathouse of a less lascivious kind.  When Chloe
returns from her trip, however, Gris-Gris is "perdu," and the hunt for the
inappropriately named animal (Gris-Gris is unquestionably black) is on.</P>
<P>What began as a short subject has been expanded by director Klapisch, who
uses the storyline as a springboard for showing us the changing face of
Paris.  Gentrification is hitting the city and hitting it hard.  Cafes that
sell cups of coffee for four francs are being knocked down to make room for
coffeehouses that sell them for ten.  Music stores are being replaced with
high-priced boutiques.  Small, family-run businesses are giving way to
large, impersonal supermarkets.  Tenants are being evicted every which way
in order to accomodate unchecked urban growth.</P>
<P>The metropolitan landscape might be succumbing to the wrecker's ball but
the inhabitants are harder to displace.  Klapisch weaves a colorful
tapestry in his depiction of Chloe's neighbors, colleagues, and cat-lovers,
from the dotty old women who form a cross-city network of concerned persons
(including the head of "Cats Are People, Too"), to Michel's revolving
lovers, to a mysterious drummer who catches Chloe's eye.  In addition,
there are the rough-edged inhabitants of the local watering hole, including
the dim-witted Djamel (Zinedine Soualem, who resembles an emaciated Tom
Jones), who accompanies Chloe on most of her circuitous adventures.  He
even offers to take her to the seaside...but that's how she got into this
mess to begin with.</P>
<P>Newcomer Clavel is tremendous as Chloe, convincingly portraying a woman
battling a sense of loss and loneliness.  Her attempts to find true love on
the streets and in the nightclubs of a pulsating Paris are marked both by
sadness and humor.  "When the Cat's Away" is most successful at blending
these elements in a way that resists easy interpretation: with whom should
Chloe ultimately wind up, and is her cat really partner enough?  That said,
the film's final image of a joyous Chloe running down the street is
remarkable.  It's likely to stay with the viewer for a long, long time.</P>
