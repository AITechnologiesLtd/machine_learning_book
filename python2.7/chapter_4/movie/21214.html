<P>AN IDEAL HUSBAND (PG).  
(Twentieth Century Fox)
Director: Oliver Parker
Stars: Cate Blanchett, Minnie Driver, Rupert Everett, Julianne Moore, 
Jeremy Northam, John Wood, Peter Vaughan, Lindsay Duncan, Jeroen Krebbe,
Michael Culkin
Running time: 97 minutes.</P>
<P>Oscar Wilde's sophisticated wit, genial bon mots and acerbic
one liners shine in Oliver Parker's solid, if somewhat uninspired
screen adaptation of his play An Ideal Husband.  Parker seems more
comfortable with the demands of adapting Wilde's quaintly old
fashioned, Victorian-era drawing room comedy than he did with his
recent version of Shakespeare's Othello (featuring Kenneth Branagh and
Laurence Fishburne).</P>
<P>An Ideal Husband is faithful to Wilde's play and still retains
whiffs of its theatrical origins, but Parker beautifully enervates the
script and the drama.  He has also assembled a solid international
cast, who relish the witty dialogue and deftly bring the urbane
characters to life.</P>
<P>The central plot centres around a scheme to blackmail upright
and rising politician Sir Robert Chiltern (Jeremy Northam, from The
Winslow Boy, etc) into offering his support to a dubious enterprise
during a speech in Parliament.  The scheming Mrs Cheveley (Julianne
Moore) knows the secret behind Sir Robert's wealth and threatens to
expose him if he refuses to co-operate.  Sir Robert is more concerned
about the effect the revelation will have on his devoted but morally
principled wife Gertrude (Aussie actress Cate Blanchett, recently seen
in Pushing Tin.)  In desperation, Sir Robert turns to his friend Lord
Goring (Rupert Everett) for help.  Despite his wealth, Lord Goring is
an idle bachelor who enjoys shirking any sense of responsibility
whatsoever, much to the disgust of his father (John Wood).</P>
<P>All sorts of questions concerning morality, duty, and
responsibilities are raised.  There are plenty of comic mishaps and
misunderstandings along the way before everything is happily resolved.
Everett is beautifully cast as Wilde's witty and debonair alter ego
here, and his suave and sure way with the clever one liners ensures
that the film comes alive whenever he is on screen.  Northam seems
quite comfortable in effete period pieces, and delivers a solid
performance as the troubled Chiltern.  Blanchett delivers a nicely
restrained and understated performance as Chiltern's loyal wife, but
is easily outclassed by Moore's manipulative and scheming Mrs
Cheveley.  Again proving that she is the best American actress doing
British pictures these days, Minnie Driver is superb as Mabel,
Chiltern's flighty younger sister who has a crush on Lord Goring.</P>
<P>The settings and production design are quite exquisite and
lavish, and add to the overall warm atmosphere that pervades the film.
An Ideal Husband is not spectacular as a piece of cinema, but it is
witty and entertaining enough to satisfy audiences.</P>
