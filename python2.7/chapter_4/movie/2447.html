<P>     Martha Coolidge's ANGIE begins as a delightful, if somewhat
familiar, romp through romantic comedy territory.  Then, somewhere in
the middle, it becomes something completely different.  Depending on
the individual, this shift may be seen as a welcome surprise or an
unpleasant diversion.  There are those who will find it to be both.
One thing ANGIE is not, however, is typical.</P>
<P>     Born in Bensonhurst in 1961, Angie (Geena Davis) grew up without
her mother, who ran away when she was three.  She spent her formative
years living with her father (Philip Bosco) and stepmother (Jenny
O'Hara), a woman whom she never liked.  Now in her early thirties,
Angie finds herself pregnant by her boyfriend Vinnie (James Gandolfini)
who, upon learning of the happy event, promptly decides that they
should get married.  Angie reluctantly agrees, but it isn't until she
meets a blarney-spewing Irishman named Noel (Stephen Rea) that she has
the courage to face Vinnie with her doubts.</P>
<P>     No one is going to find themselves in unfamiliar territory at the
outset of ANGIE.  For the first half, the storyline is pure romantic
comedy, complete with the two boyfriends--each representing a
different lifestyle--and the various subplots and complications.
Then, following a hilarious birth scene that features profane
renditions of Marvin Hamlisch songs, the tone and intent of ANGIE
shifts to melodrama, and there aren't many more laughs to be had.  This
frothy motion picture turns serious in a hurry.</P>
<P>     Some might find the abrupt shift in mood disconcerting or annoying
and, to a degree, it is both.  But it also represents a welcome change
that the film is willing to break away from the expected norms and
spring a series of surprises on the audience.  There's nothing so bland
as a movie whose next events can be predicted scenes in advance.  ANGIE
may be flawed in a number of ways, but this isn't one of them.</P>
<P>     One of the reasons the movie survives the second-half melodrama is
because the acting keeps things at a high level, even on those
occasions when the dialogue turns stilted.  Geena Davis is consistently
strong, and Stephen Rea is a whirlwind of energy and charm.  Together,
the two work perfectly.  The rest of the cast is adequate at worst,
including Aida Turturro in a part that could have been written for
Rosie O'Donnell.</P>
<P>     Much has been made of ANGIE's appeal to the female audience, but I
found the movie to be universally enjoyable.  The character of Angie
has enough depth and richness to attract the sympathy and undestanding
of any viewer, whether that person is a man or a woman.</P>
<P>     The key to enjoying ANGIE is to not anticipate the expected.  What
the film starts as is not what it becomes by the time that the final
credits roll.  Those that go in with an open mind--and a willingness
to overlook a number of minor faults--are more likely to enjoy the
picture than those who approach it with certain preconceived notions.
The transformation may not be elegant or seamless, but it gives this
movie a distinction of originality, a trait which has become
increasingly scant in Hollywood productions.</P>
