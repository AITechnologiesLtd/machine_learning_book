<P>Good things come in small packages.  And that is a perfect description
for the film 'Little Voice'.  Set in England, this film is a triumph of
the spirit but is also a little sad at the same time, but only if you
consider the materialistic side of life and how it is denied to a small
group of people.  And the one in the centre of it all that can make
dreams come true for those around her is more concerned with the memory
of her deceased father and the visions she often has of him.</P>
<P>Laura (Jane Horrocks) or lv ("little voice") as she's nicknamed by those
around her, is a genteel, young little woman with a mousy voice who is
so shy that she's afraid of her own shadow and she rarely speaks.  She
sits in her room all day listening to vinyl records of Judy Garland,
Marilyn Monroe and Shirley Bassey left to her by her father who has
passed away and who used to run a record shop with her mother Mari
(Brenda Blethyn). Mari is a dastardly vain woman who wears tight
clothes, is overweight, wears too much make-up and is way past her prime
but still describes herself as having an a** to die for.  She curses,
stirs a hail storm of criticism at people, drinks heavily and lives like
a slob.  She's the perfect candidate for tabloid television and would be
referred to as trailer park trash if she lived in America.   </P>
<P>The old record shop has now been turned into a flat for residential
purposes where lv and her mother live.  As the film opens, lv and her
mother are having their phone repaired and the telephone repairman's
helper (Ewan McGregor) is attracted to lv.  He often comes by to see her
and on one occasion he propels the ladder bucket of his truck, you know
the kind used by hydro and telephone workers, up to lv's room to pay her
an intimate visit.  He also raises pigeons as a hobby which makes for
some of the film's more humourous scenes.</P>
<P>Lv and her mother come into contact with Ray (Michael Caine).  He's a
sleazy, small time talent agent (but is a pretty decent guy all around)
who helps the local night club find new acts and lv is his latest
discovery. He hears her singing from her room one night and gets her new
clothes, polishes up her appearance and wheels her out on cue.  The only
problem is that lv doesn't want to sing for an audience, only for
herself as a tribute to her deceased father.  She often looks at his
picture on the wall of her bedroom as she's singing.  Her debut at the
nightclub is made successful only when she imagines her father is
sitting in one of the chairs at the club watching her sing.  Lv sort of
reminded me of that old Looney Toons cartoon about the frog who would
only sing for the construction worker that found him and for no one
else.  Ditto here.  Lv only wants to sing when she's around or imagines
the appearance of her late father.</P>
<P>The film is written and directed by Mark Herman based on the stage play
by Jim Cartwright.  It's an excellent form of original movie
entertainment made superb by a cast of characters so different from each
other that real life couldn't be reflected more credibly than by this
film.  Jane Horrocks does her own singing in the film and is dynamite at
it.  Brenda Blethyn is totally convincing as her mother and does a
complete 180 degree turn from her role in 'Secrets and Lies' which
brought her an Oscar nomination in 1996.  What a pleasure it is to see
Michael Caine in top form this time around. One of my favourite British
actors, Caine appeared in 1997 with Jack Nicholson in 'Blood and Wine'
but had a secondary and rather forgettable role.  He's astoundingly good
in this movie by combining his knowledge of show business and his desire
to feather his own nest by using lv's talent.  He's the kind of guy you
should dislike but Caine finds a way to make his character likable.</P>
<P>The climax of the film is a little bizarre given the tempo of the rest
of the movie but 'Little Voice' will become a buried treasure that I
hope audiences will embrace long after its limited theatrical run which
is a shame because this film deserves to be seen by as many people as
possible.  It's just that good.  I hope in some small way, it is
remembered somewhat at Oscar time.</P>
