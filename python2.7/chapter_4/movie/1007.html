<PRE>                                  IMPROMPTU
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     IMPROMPTU is a film staring Judy Davis.  It is itself an impromptu
on the beginning of the famous liaison of George Sand, the French
novelist, and Frederick Chopin, the Polish composer and pianist.  If you
find those attributions necessary, you may not feel drawn initially to
IMPROMPTU because you have not been infected yet with these fascinating
personalities and artists.  If you find the attributions irritating and
inadequate, you are the primary audience for this film.  However, I urge
people of the first category to see IMPROMPTU, too; it is a wonderful
film, funny, alive, visually and musically rich, driven by complex
performances by some really wonderful actors.</P>
<P>     George Sand is played by Judy Davis, an actor I am not familiar
with, but one I want to see again soon.  Sand was a woman who achieved
notoriety in her day by adopting a male nom de plume, wearing men's
clothes, smoking cigars, being a sportswoman, conducting her love
affairs openly, and being her own person; she was a kind of one-woman
cause celebre in 1830s and 1840s.  In IMPROMPTU Sand invites herself
to a country house party to meet and seduce Chopin, for whom she has
developed an obsession on the strength of his music.  The socially
ambitious duchess has invited him, his great friend Franz Liszt (played
by Julian Sands), Liszt's lover (Bernadette Peters), Eugene Delacroix,
the painter, and Edward de Muset, the poet and Sands' great (but now
former) love, invited them for a fortnight in the country.</P>
<P>     I believe this wonderful set-up is the invention of the screen
writer.  (You will note the lack of many names in this notice--my source
material was destroyed before I could write this and I have a
Emmenthalerisch memory (full of holes).)  The house party is hilariously
disastrous, Sand's wild children contributing not a little to the final
catastrophe.</P>
<P>     Back in Paris, Sand continues her pursuit of Chopin, who is
depicted here as prim to the point of prissiness.  Meanwhile another
claimant has entered the lists for the reluctant Pole.  And Sand is
having problems with a past that continues to make claims on her,
ludicrously and ridiculously.  Through all this bedroom-farcical comedy
runs a serious and tender love story that is finding itself as the movie
unfolds.</P>
<P>     And through it all, Davis is preposterous, impossible, tender,
desperate, strong, weak, cunning, naive, awkward, and graceful, full of
guile and honesty, till she near to breaks your heart with a performance
that nearly turns IMPROMPTU into a one-woman show.</P>
<P>     Fortunately, for the viewer who believes that two great
performances are better than one, Peters is more than up to the
challenge of holding her own on screen.  For once, Peters gets a chance
to *act* and in a major part.  Her character, a titled lady who left her
husband to be Liszt's muse (and winds up being the mother of his
enormous flock of infants, whose crying he escapes by his continuous
touring and concertizing), is turned from being a light, sophisticated 
Parisienne into a shrew and harpy by the unhappiness and unfairness of
her life as a "conventional" mistress and upper-class bohemian, her
life as a woman who has children, stays home, and whose role is to
"inspire" her man to greatness.  In the end, it ruins her, but allows
Peters to register the most mature performance that I have ever seen 
from her.</P>
<P>     But then this is a great ensemble cast with wonderful, memorable
performances from every single member.  The cast is mostly English and
the Frenchness of the script is perhaps a little thin.  The country
nobleman who unwillingly hosts his wife's artists is an English squire
of the old school, interested in hunting, not art; perhaps such types
are also French.  I don't know.  But this is a very English film, IMHO,
for all the French locales and names.  The squire-type even says "Bon
appetit" with an English accent.  I was also slightly distracted by the
resemblance between the handsome young man who plays Chopin and the
Chekhov-character from the original Star Trek days, the smile, the
physical business, the East Slavic accent, quite striking, actually;
fortunately this Chopin is a better actor by far than the scene-chewing,
"wodka" drinking Mr. Chekhov.</P>
<P>     These minuscule cavils aside, I cheerfully recommend IMPROMPTU to
you.  It is a first-rate movie rich in performances.</P>
