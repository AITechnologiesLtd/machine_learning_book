<P>     ALL THE BOYS AND GIRLS IN THEIR TIME is a series of films 
commissioned by the French-German TV station Arte.  Ten directors were 
asked to participate by making a movie about their teenage years.  Each 
film had to include at least one party scene which highlighted the music 
of the time.  U.S. GO HOME, Claire Denis' entry (and the best of the 
four movies thus far completed) looks at life for teenagers in 1965 
France, and the positive and negative influences of American culture. </P>
<P>     U.S. GO HOME follows 14-year old Marlene as she, her best friend, 
and her brother attend the same party.  Marlene's private quest for the 
night is to lose her virginity, but her first several attempts meet with 
failure, and her resolve wavers.  In the end, hitchhiking back home, she 
finds what she wants -- if not necessarily what she needs -- from an 
American serviceman stationed at a nearby military base.   </P>
<P>     Denis, whose previous directing credits include CHOCOLAT and I 
CAN'T SLEEP, develops Marlene's likable, fascinating personality within 
a very short time.  The film is driven by the girl's combined 
fascination with and fear of sex, and the mix of solid acting and sure 
direction makes this something more than a common coming-of-age story.  
U.S. GO HOME is alive with energy.  The music --most of it 1960s 
American rock-and-roll -- pervades the film, but the U.S. influence 
hinted at in the title doesn't become explicit until the arrival of 
Captain Vito Brown.  The movie is not intended as a political statement, 
although it does present some views of the time. (Marlene's brother, for 
example, refuses a proffered drink from Captain Brown, stating proudly, 
"I'm a communist, I don't drink Coca-Cola.)  Rather, this is a look at 
one character and the meaning that a night's events have on her life.  
In the process, U.S. GO HOME examines the importance of love, 
friendship, family, and, of course, sex.  That's a lot to pack into one 
hour, but Denis does it with consummate skill, weaving a tale that 
captivates, intrigues, and entertains. </P>
