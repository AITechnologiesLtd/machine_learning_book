<P>Although he has only been in town for a little over four months, Dr. 
Mumford already has more patients than the other two therapists in 
the small, homey village. Mumford has a way about him. He avoids 
technical jargon, has a surprisingly frank approach and, more than 
anything, he is great at listening. So great that most clients find 
it easy to share their deepest secrets with him, even though he is 
awfully casual in the area of patient confidentiality. What they 
don't know about Mumford is that the good doctor has a secret of his 
own. As he eventually tells a skateboarding billionaire who becomes 
his patient and friend, "I am not now, nor have I ever been, a 
psychologist."</P>
<P>This gentle comedy shares a few similarities to "The Big Chill," 
another film from writer/director Lawrence Kasdan. Both are 
structurally loose, with next to no major conflict. Instead, the 
focus is on the small personal dramas of a number of nicely-drawn 
characters. Both productions tend to wander, hopping from one subplot 
to another. While I generally find meandering of this sort annoying, 
it proves refreshing in this context, largely due to the 
overwhelmingly benign nature of the story. With its sweet, easygoing 
tone, "Mumford" is the cinematic equivalent of a nice lazy stroll on 
a fall evening with a glass of iced tea in hand. </P>
<P>Loren Dean gives a wonderfully low-key performance as the mysterious 
young therapist. Although Mumford's name and credentials are phony, 
his intentions are genuine. He cares so much for his patients that he 
dares to speak his mind. When shopaholic mother Althea Brockett (Mary 
McDonnell) complains that "my kids say if I don't get therapy they'll 
have nothing to do with me," he nods and states "Good kids." When 
lethargic patient Sofie Crisp (Hope Davis) asks if he believes 
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a genuine illness or just a justification 
for doing nothing, he replies, "I don't know what's real and what 
isn't. That's never been my strong suit." </P>
<P>After Sofie leaves, Mumford goes online to read about CFS and comes 
up with an interesting form of treatment, holding future sessions 
while the two walk though town. Sofie soon finds herself helping the 
doc cover a neighbor kid's paper route, as her energy, spirit and 
affection for the therapist grows ever stronger.</P>
<P>As the film progresses, we learn more about the motivations behind 
Mumford's big deception, and the revelations add poignancy and 
clarity to the character. Loren Dean, whose handsome features have a 
curiously unfinished quality, is an enormously likable actor, aided 
immeasurably by two exceptional supporting players. As Lily, 
Mumford's landlady and friend, Alfre Woodard is earthy and beguiling. 
Although her screen time is limited, she has a presence that lingers 
even when Lily is away running her neighborhood café.</P>
<P>Jason Lee, so deliciously acidic as Banky in "Chasing Amy," gives the 
sunniest performance of his career as Skip Skipperton, a billionaire 
computer mogul who craves friendship so badly that he hires Mumford 
primarily to be his buddy. Despite his wealth, Skip is still just a 
lonesome kid (his corporate headquarters has an elaborate skateboard 
ramp) and Lee is quite effective at blending the character's 
endearing combination of intelligence and naiveté. The role also 
gives the former international skateboard champion a chance to show 
off his considerable skills at the sport. </P>
<P>I wish the film had spent more time with Mumford, Sofie, Lily and 
Skip, and less on the campaign by a smarmy lawyer (Martin Short) to 
discredit Mumford. Even though there are some amusing moments with 
Short and a pair of therapists (David Paymer and Jane Adams), the 
film could have reached the same conclusion without the subplot. </P>
<P>Lawrence Kasdan directs his story in a down-to-earth fashion, saving 
visual frills for flashbacks and noirish sequences illustrating the 
pulp fantasies of nebbish pharmacist Henry Follet (Pruitt Taylor 
Vince). Kasdan juggles his vignettes fairly well, although they 
become a bit scattered late in the film. To his credit, an obligatory 
courtroom scene is short, crisp and avoids the usual clichés. James 
Newton Howard provides the music, which consistently accents the tone 
of the story without ever becoming manipulative or overbearing. </P>
<P>Some critics have savaged "Mumford," calling it nothing but an 
aimless, lackadaisical trifle. While the script might have benefited 
from more polishing, I like what Kasdan has done here. At one point, 
Dr. Mumford wonders aloud if any therapy can really cure problems 
that started in early childhood. Instead, he uses charm, common sense 
and empathy to help those around him grow and feel just a little 
better. After watching "Mumford," I not only felt a little better, I 
was downright happy. This particular trifle turned out to be the 
right treatment for me.</P>
