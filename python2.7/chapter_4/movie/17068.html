Reviewed October 20, 1998.</P>
<P>It is known that it took Oprah Winfrey ten years to bring Nobel Prize 
winner Toni Morrison's novel, "Beloved," to the screen, and she was 
determined to get it made. It was only until she met director Jonathan 
Demme (1991's "Silence of the Lambs") that she knew she had found the 
perfect person to make the adaptation.</P>
<P>"Beloved" is a mysterious, unusual, sprawling epic, running just under 3 
hours, and set in Cincinnati, circa 1873. Sethe (Oprah Winfrey), a 
former slave, lives in a quaint rural home with her quiet 18-year-old 
daughter, Denver (Kimberly Elise), and an angry ghost that haunts the 
house. Sethe also had two sons that ran away eight years earlier, and a 
baby daughter whom is no longer with her. Aside from the ghost, things 
begin to look up for Sethe when an old friend from her slave days at 
Sweet Home, Paul D (Danny Glover), turns up on her doorstep one day and 
becomes her lover. The peculiar title character, Beloved (Thandie 
Newton), enters the film thirty minutes into it, found with her back up 
against a tree stump in front of their house, beetles crawling all over 
her body. Sethe allows Beloved to stay at their home, and she becomes a 
sort of playmate with Denver, but it is obvious from the start that 
there is something awfully fishy about this young woman.</P>
<P>That is all of the story that I would even dare mention, because 
"Beloved" is the type of movie that, if you are unfamiliar with the plot 
going in, the less said, the better. Those going into "Beloved" 
expecting a slavery drama will, no doubt, be rather shocked by the film, 
as it is filled with many supernatural elements, and deals with such 
elements as ghosts, evil spirits, and resurrection.</P>
<P>"Beloved" is a deliberately-paced, but well-crafted, exceptionally 
performed motion picture. There are so many brilliantly effective 
moments throughout that it is quite disappointing when, after 3 hours of 
investing your time in it, it doesn't seem to add up to much. The story 
is intriguing and truly original, and the film felt as if it was leading 
up to an emotional powerhouse of an ending, but after the central story 
concludes, the film goes on for another twenty minutes, which is 
especially problematic since the intensity and mystery of the story has 
vanished. Although the ending starts to drag, there also seem to be 
chunks of the story that have been edited out, which was a mistake. 
Things occur quickly in the last hour, and plot elements are forgotten 
about or go unexplained. My guess is that the picture was originally a 
4-hour film, so they had to trim it, but in doing so, they edited the 
wrong section out. It was the very ending that needed a severe edit, not 
the sections that they did cut out.</P>
<P>Maybe it is beginning to sound like I didn't care for, "Beloved," which 
is untrue. Although nowhere nearly as brilliant as it would like to be, 
the film is nonetheless an admirable piece of work.</P>
<P>The performances from the central cast are, by far, the highlight of the 
piece. Winfrey, in her first feature film since 1985's superior, "The 
Color Purple," is strong and self-assured, not to mention able to get 
the viewer to forget that she is a talk show host from the first frame. 
Thandie Newton, as the difficult Beloved, has what is probably the most 
difficult role, as she is given what is perhaps an unplayable role. 
Newton somehow succeeds, however, in both capturing our sympathy in one 
scene, and frustrating us in the next. The standout in the cast is 
Kimberly Elise, who gives the film's most touching, sympathetic 
performance. She very much deserves an Academy Award nomination come 
next February. She is that dazzling.</P>
<P>While watching "Beloved," I could easily see one of the best films of 
the year within, but it ultimately let me down in its penultimate 
moments. Winfrey, Demme, and screenwriters Akosua Busia, Richard 
LaGravenese, and Adam Brooks, should be applauded for successfully 
adapting such a complex, unwieldly novel, but it certainly could have 
been so much more. </P>
