<PRE>Morning Glory (1933)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 84</PRE>
<P>Katherine Hepburn won four Academy Awards for Best Actress,
and was nominated on eight other occasions.  Her first Oscar 
and nomination was for "Morning Glory," a stagey drama in
which she plays a stage-struck young actress with a knack
for getting men to take a paternalistic interest in her.</P>
<P>Armed only with a letter from George Bernard Shaw, she
leaves her small hometown to land a starring role on Broadway.
Soon she realizes that parts of any size are not open for
the taking, and lives in poverty while playing trivial roles
in stock shows.  But she keeps trying, using her charms
to win agreeable stage veteran C. Aubrey Smith as her mentor,
and playwright Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as her proponent.  At last 
she is given her big break, a starring role, but will she be 
only a morning glory, a one-hit wonder?</P>
<P>Hepburn's charming character is contrasted against that of
Mary Duncan, who plays a temperamental and spoiled actress.
Producer Menjou coddles Duncan, while shunning Hepburn since 
she is too unknown to sell tickets.</P>
<P>I only have one major complaint.  Hepburn gets drunk at a party.
Her speech is hopelessly slurred.  To impress the stage celebrities
present, she gives two dramatic performances from Shakespeare,
both with perfect diction.  Is she drunk or isn't she?</P>
<P>"Morning Glory" has an outstanding script, and fine performances
by the leads and supporting cast.  The score is also excellent.
Fairbanks may actually give a better performance than Hepburn, as 
her lines are sometimes breathlessly delivered making them difficult
to understand.  This film could use closed-captioning.</P>
