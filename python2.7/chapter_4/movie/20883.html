<P> "I DON'T HAVE A RADIO!"
Starring Robin Williams, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Alan Arkin, Liev
Schreiber. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Robin Williams has the rarest of gifts: the ability to rise above the
most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style.
Overwhelmingly, his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and
enjoyable at best (with the notable exception of Flubber). So when I,
the one person who has refused to abandon him despite Patch Adams, tell
you that not even Williams can save his latest project, you know it's in
trouble. Jakob the Liar is a confused, muddled little movie; a
generically "uplifting" film with a fundamental contradiction: the
message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie
doesn't realize it.</P>
<P>Williams plays Jakob Haim, a Jew imprisoned in a Polish ghetto during
World War II. One night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly
sent to the office of a high-ranking German officer for his punishment.
Jakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a
radio broadcast. The announcement (in English, but punctuated by a
triumphant "Heil Hitler!") is that Russian troops are only miles away
from Jakob's ghetto. Liberation! he thinks. The next day, Jakob tells
the news to his closest friend, a volatile prize fighter named Misha
(Liev Schreiber), who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message
along.</P>
<P>Soon, it is a common assumption in the ghetto that Jakob has a radio
hidden in his home -- a crime punishable by death. This is absurdly
false, but the more Jakob tells the people of the ghetto this, the more
convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in
the war that is to decide their fate. The danger, of course, is that the
Germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto, and rumors
about the radio can get out and put Jakob in great danger.</P>
<P>In a curiously irrelevant subplot, Jakob finds a 11-year old girl who
has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small
home. Apparently he is afraid that she will be discovered, and goes to
great length to make sure of that -- just why the idea frightens him is
never made clear. He and the girl build an uninvolving, generic
relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as
it was in the beginning.</P>
<P>The moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine. But Jakob the
Liar forgets that the hope that Jakob brings to his ghetto is false.
Such hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when
those expectations aren't met, the results are far worse than if there
was no hope. That's the film's biggest detriment: it is based on a false
assumption and thus comes off as painfully false. It's never moving
because it doesn't give us anything to be moved by. Jakob the Liar fails
to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing.</P>
<P>Robin Williams doesn't inject the film with life, as a matter of fact,
he seems a little out of it, as if crippled by his fake accent. He is
stragely unenthusiastic; his character is one who spreads hope but his
performance is lifeless, hopeless. Not since Good Will Hunting has he
abandoned his signature style to this extent; this isn't the Robin
Williams we know and love. In Good Will Hunting he became a serious
actor and won an Oscar for it. Here, he is more of a wannabe serious
actor; an impostor.</P>
<P>Jakob the Liar will be compared with last year's Life is Beautiful
because it is being marketed as a "Holocaust comedy". It's not a comedy.
It tries, sometimes, but it rarely works. Is it a melodrama? A war
movie? A character study? No, no, and no. Jakob the Liar is the kind of
movie that can't be placed into a category; not because it covers so
many different genres but because it fails at just about every one it
attempts.</P>
