<PRE>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1999)
1/2 *
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1999 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" is one of the worst movies by a
director of significance that I have ever seen.  It's shameful that
such an amazing book could be transformed -- by an excellent director --
 into a movie of such appalling emptiness and shapelessness.  It's not
even a good lousy movie.  More below the belt than that I can't get.</P>
<P>Ostensibly drawn from Hunter S. Thompson's seminal work of the same
name, "Fear and Loathing" gives us Raoul (Johnny Depp, unrecognizable
and damn near incoherent with that cigarette holder wedged in his
mouth) and Gonzo (Benicio del Toro) as drug-addled journalists who have
allegedly been sent to cover a bike race out near Vegas.  They stick
around after that to also examine (if that's the word) a convention of
district attorneys, and take drugs.  Lots of drugs.</P>
<P>I quote: "We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline,
five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half-full of
cocaine and a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers, downers, screamers,
laughers... also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a
pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls. But the only thing that worried
me was the ether. There is nothing more irresponsible and depraved than
a man in the depths of an ether binge, and I knew we would be getting
into that rotten stuff sooner or later."</P>
<P>Raoul and Gonzo consume most of this chemical smorgasbord through the
course of the movie, and the audience is forced to watch the results.
At first there is the hint of something wicked going on, like when they
try to con their way into a Debbie Reynolds performance by giving the
usher a toot, but then the same pattern is repeated, without any real
variation or insight, until we are left with something that cannot even
be watched for more than a few minutes at a time without cringing.</P>
<P>What we have is not so much a movie about drugs as it is a movie that
simply contains drugs.  There's no point of view, no insight, and not a
hint of wit or genuine examination of character.  There is just Raoul
and Gonzo getting into one stoned mess after another.  Cheech and Chong
used to make movies like this, too, but the saving grace was that they
were intermittently funny.  "Fear and Loathing" isn't.</P>
<P>Much noise has been made about "Fear and Loathing" being a dissection
of "Straight" America during the dog-end of the Sixties.  Horse
manure.  Gilliam does this by ineptly throwing some stock footage of
Sixties protests at us, and by having everyone in the movie who's
an "Establishment" person be an asshole.  But Raol and Duke are
scarcely any less assholes themselves, so what's the point?</P>
<P>I like Gilliam as a director; every now and then he pulls himself
together for a really virtuoso movie like "12 Monkeys."  Here, he was
apparently drafted in after the original director, Alex Cox, left; I
suspect Cox, whose movies include the amazing "Repo Man", would have
been able to REALLY make something scary and anarchic out of this
material.  In Gilliam's hands, what we have is barely even intelligible
as a movie.</P>
