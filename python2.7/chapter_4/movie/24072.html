<P>BRINGING OUT THE DEAD (R).  
(Touchstone/Paramount/Buena Vista International)
Director: Martin Scorsese
Stars: Nicolas Cage, Patricia Arquette, John Goodman, Ving Rhames, Tom 
Sizemore, Mary Beth Hurt, Marc Anthony, Cliff Curtis, with the voices
of Martin Scorsese and Queen Latifah as dispatchers
Running time: 121 minutes.</P>
<P>Martin Scorsese returns to the mean streets of New York for
this blistering, intense and frenetically paced journey through 56
hours in the life of a traumatised paramedic.  Paramedics are the
emergency response medical teams that nightly race through the
cesspool of a major city in decay, dealing with alcoholics, drug
overdoses, violence, suicide, death and misery, and cleaning up the
human detritus.</P>
<P>Frank Pierce (Nicolas Cage) is a burnt out case, fuelled by a
mixture of booze, pills, adrenaline, and haunted by the ghosts of
those he has been unable to save - in particular, Rosa, a teenage
Puerto Rican girl.  Then he begins a relationship with Mary Burke
(Cage's real life wife Patricia Arquette), the daughter of a heart
attack victim, and briefly glimpses a hope of salvation.  We gain more
insight into Frank's fragile state through the contrast of his three
partners, who all have their own way of dealing with the pressures.
Larry (John Goodman) is an essentially decent man who remains detached
from the carnage he witnesses on a nightly basis.  The fast talking
and deeply religious Marcus (Ving Rhames) uses a sense of humour as a
defence mechanism, while Tom (Tom Sizemore) is a volatile, blunt and
colourful sociopath who loves taking risks.</P>
<P>Taking a break from action hero mode, Cage returns to the type
of intense, flawed every man that he plays so convincingly.  His
drawn, haunted looking face, dishevelled and manic appearance are
perfectly suited to his role here as a man on the brink of a breakdown
and barely able to cope with the pressures of his job.</P>
<P>Bringing Out The Dead is based on the best selling novel
written by Joe Connelly, himself a former paramedic, who spent ten
years with the New York service, and worked on the film as a technical
adviser.  Script writer Paul Schrader (Taxi Driver, etc) brings a
gritty, blackly comic edge to the material, which Scorsese directs
with his typical relentless energy and cinematic flair.  He brings a
frantic quality and uncompromising realism to the film, which is
shaped by his brilliant mix of music, stunning visual verve and deft
use of symbolism.  Veteran cinematographer Robert Richardson creates a
surreal portrait of New York, and his dazzling, dizzy camera races
through the city at breakneck speed.</P>
<P>If you thought the emergency room of a certain television
series was weird, here Scorsese depicts it as anarchic, chaotic and
combustible, giving these scenes a nightmarish quality.  Bringing Out
The Dead is a powerful return to form for Scorsese, one of America's
finest directors.</P>
