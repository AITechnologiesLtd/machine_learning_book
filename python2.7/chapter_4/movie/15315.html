<PRE>THE SIEGE (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Cher Johnson
Copyright 1998 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>A while ago, I saw an interview with ex-X-Files writers Glen Morgan and
James Wong. In the interview, Morgan and Wong, who wrote some of the most
memorable episodes of the show, were asked how they came up with some of
their bizarre ideas. The two looked at each other and answered with a short
story. What they did when out of ideas was look out their office window and
just ask, "what if?" about something ordinary. From there the two start
asking "what if?" about things related and that's how they spin the tales
that they do. This sounds like the same technique The Siege writers took
when they wrote the movie.</P>
<P>What if terrorists started terrorizing New York? What if the terrorists
were Arabs? What if society started turning against Arabs? What if Arabs
were taken and locked into concentration camps? What if the US law
enforcement agencies could not handle the terrorist activities? What if the
US Army was called in to handle the terrorists? What if you lost your
freedom and your civil liberties?</P>
<P>For the first two-thirds of The Siege, it was a wonderfully entertaining
film. This portion of the film follows FBI agent Anthony Hubbard (Denzel
Washington) and Frank Haddad (Tony Shalhoub) as they try to track down the
terrorists bombing New York City. This part of the film shows crackling
good hard-boiled detective work. The two meet a suspicious CIA agent, Elise
Kraft (Annette Bening), who may or may not be on their side.</P>
<P>The exact point when The Siege falls apart is easy to spot; it's when Bruce
Willis enters the film. I like Willis as an actor, and his acting is not
the reason The Siege starts to unravel. The character that Willis portrays
ruins the film. General William Devereaux is in charge of the Army presence
that is brought into New York City to shut it down and squeeze until the
terrorists come out. I'm not sure what happened, but it seemed that the
writers at this point just ran out of ideas. From this point on everything
is contrived, including the awful ending.</P>
<P>Ultimately, the major failings of The Siege is that it strives to be
politically correct. Because the filmmakers did not want to offend anyone,
The Siege ends up alienating everyone. The writers, Lawrence Wright, Menno
Meyjes, and Edward Zwick, know they are going to take heat for portraying
Arabs as terrorists, so they also write about Arabs who are taken into
interment camps. The problem is that the writers deal with both the
terrorists and prisoners at arms-length. We never get to know or feel for a
prisoner and we never get to know or feel for why the terrorists are doing
what they're doing. The script turns the Arab people into a lumped group of
"they" or "them" instead of having characters that we can relate to.</P>
<P>I was somewhat disappointed in The Siege when I look back and see the
powerful movies that have come from the collaboration between director
Zwick and actor Washington, such as Glory and Courage Under Fire. The Siege
does not reach the heights that these movies obtained.</P>
<P>The performances are all top-notch; even that of Bruce Willis. Washington,
as always, is intense and believable onscreen. He is given a few speeches
where he shows just how good of an actor he is - including a speech near
the end of the film where he talks about freedom and the Constitution.
Bening is good as the ever unclear, good or bad, CIA agent Elise Kraft.</P>
<P>The one performance that I enjoyed - even more than Washington's - is Tony
Shalhoub's performance. Shalhoub is able to switch, effortlessly, between
serious and playfully comic. Where Willis is too serious, Washington too
uptight, and Bening too crafty, Shalhoub is level and sane. Shalhoub brings
both humor and humanity to his character. Kudos to Tony Shalhoub for his
splendid performance in The Siege; he made the film watchable.</P>
<P>But, in the end, The Siege falls into mediocrity because it's not brave
enough to take a stance. Instead, The Siege wanders and tries to please
everyone, but fails miserably. Catch The Siege on video for the
performances of Denzel Washington, Annette Bening, Bruce Willis, and Tony
Shalhaub.</P>
