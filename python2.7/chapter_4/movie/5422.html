<P>"The Celluloid Closet, Homosexuality in the Movies," published in 1981 
and revised in 1987, is still THE book on that huge subject. Its author 
Vito Russo died in 1991, but I feel certain that other specialists will 
pick up the torch, update and expand this seminal work.</P>
<P>The film cannot reproduce the full book, yet it is a most satisfying, 
comprehensive primer, with many interviewees who all have something 
interesting to say, and with clips from 100-plus films.</P>
<P>Thoughtfully, sensitively and quietly --though it certainly would have 
the right to be polemical -- the documentary follows the inclusion, 
exclusion and depiction of gays in cinema.  </P>
<P>In the history of the movies (now 101 years old), homosexuality was for 
a long time rarely seen on the screen. When it was it came either as a 
source of mocking laughter or as an affliction. TCC ("The Celluloid 
Closet"), does a fine job of avoiding procrustean principles, the kind 
that, in works with a cause, often modify facts to make them fit the 
theories.</P>
<P>Oddly, it is only at the beginning of the film that one finds some 
generalizations. In brief 1895 footage by the Edison studios, two men 
are dancing together to the music of a third. (This gets repeated at the 
end of TCC). But the dancing of two same-sex persons does not 
necessarily mean gayness. It is done in boys' and girls' schools, in 
ballrooms, in countryside dances.</P>
<P>Also,"Rebecca's" sinister Mrs. Danvers  did not necessarily feel a 
lesbian attraction to the first Mrs. de Winter. And in "Rebel Without a 
Cause," Sal Mineo clearly play a (perhaps unconsciously) gay kid with a 
crush on James Dean, but the fact that he had Alan Ladd's photo in his 
locker may be stretching the burden of proof. Many a super-straight 
schoolboy has had pictures of male celebrities.</P>
<P>Be it as it may, TCC has ample illustrations of the mockery of gays as 
flamboyant and effeminate, in early films, followed by surrogate gays 
who were shown as sissies, stock characters as offensive today as Stepin 
Fetchit caricatures of blacks or even Eddie "Rochester" Anderson types 
of eye-rolling frightened supporting cast. The sissies included prissy, 
fussbudgetty types, seldom perceived as gay by their public then, but 
now often seen as such by viewers of old movies.</P>
<P>In the 1930s, from Greta Garbo to Marlene Dietrich, lesbianism (or the 
provocative pretense of it) are convincingly shown. Then come the forces 
of Morality attempting to regiment movies -- first in theory only (the 
Hays Office) then through Hollywood's timorous self-censorship, via the 
now infamous Production Code ruled over by its czar Joseph Breen. When 
the new standards classify homosexuality as a sex perversion, gays go, 
so to speak, underground. There are still on the screen, but in 
camouflaged, coded ways. They also become villains, whether as vampires 
or as humans.</P>
<P>Not so oddly, I find that film crypto-gayness has a parallel in the 
movies made in Central Europe in the days of harsh Communist government 
censorship. Many filmmakers managed to skirt restrictions by avoiding 
overt criticism of the State, through the use of allusions, serpentine 
plots, allegories, semi-secret dialogues with knowing audiences. This 
resulted in a Golden Age of Polish, Czech, Hungarian and Yugoslav 
cinemas. </P>
<P>In the USA the "gay thing" became a battle of wits in which films like 
"Rope" put over homosexual characters that the censors were unaware of. 
As delicious a case as any is related by Gore Vidal who, having a hand 
in the 1959 "Ben-Hur," wanted to improve drama and veracity by making 
Messala (Stephen Boyd) and Ben Hur (Charlton Heston) childhood lovers.  
Director William Wyler balked until it was decided to confide this 
information to Boyd but hide it from prudish Heston. Armed with this 
knowledge, when we now watch the two actors' reunion as adults, the 
scenes become wonderfully funny.</P>
<P>Equally diverting are the scenes from "Pillow Talk" in which Lothario 
Rock Hudson wants to reassure his skittish prey Doris Day by pretending 
to be gay. We have here a gay man impersonating a straight man 
impersonating a gay. </P>
<P>More serious is the "desperate need" (in the words of gay writer Arthur 
Laurents and others) of the gay audiences of overwhelmingly straight 
movies to find something of themselves, somewhere. "Crumbs" says gay 
author Susie Bright. These were rare, yet supplemented by codes that 
bamboozled producers and censors but were understood by the gays. The 
problem is like those of all minority audiences who have been exposed 
for decades to overwhelmingly Caucasian, Anglo-mainstream, WASP or 
Catholic cinema and saw nothing of themselves on the silver screen. </P>
<P>Examples abound, some covert, others not, as in "Suddenly Last Summer," 
that overheated and hysterical film. Gays did appear in 1950s and 1960s 
movies, but mostly as tragic, guilt-ridden characters who as often as 
not were fated to die. And even in the more sophisticated 60s and 70s, 
gays continued to be shown as unpalatable, to put it mildly--with some 
exceptions like the British "Sunday, Bloody Sunday."</P>
<P>With relaxation of rules, eventually homosexuality became the last 
screen taboo. This was broken by the 1961 British film "The Victim," 
and, in America, by the landmark "The Boys in the Band" of 1970. The 
breakthrough was followed by "Cabaret" (1972) and more pictures, but 
there was backlash: mostly bad movies in which the gays were grotesquely 
shown, reviled (as "fag, faggot, queer"), roughed up and sometimes 
gunned down with relish.</P>
<P>TCC goes on to the scandalous "Cruising" of 1980, with its gays now 
being victimizing killers and brutes instead of victims. Unless I missed 
it, the film does not mention that the same William Friedkin who had 
directed "The Boys in the Band" ten years earlier was also the director 
of "Cruising." This speaks volumes about "progress" and conscience. TCC 
also omits the fact that by and large gays have been far gentler people 
than straights. At least this is definitely my own take.</P>
<P>Another milestone came in 1982 with the cards-on-the-table "Making Love" 
which, however, made straight audiences extremely uncomfortable as well 
as inimical. Prejudices die hard. They even show when one of the two 
male leads of that film manages, in an interview, to make sure that the 
viewers know that he is straight.</P>
<P>A flashback here. Arguably, after the Code, the first Hollywood film 
with a major, once-gay character (and a gay bar) was Otto Preminger's 
"Advise and Consent" of 1962. Preminger was Mr. Code-Buster. In his  
1944 "Laura" Clifton Webb (as "Waldo Lydecker") is of a peculiar sexual 
nature.  In the 1953 "The Moon is Blue" the forbidden words "seduction" 
and "virginity" were uttered. In the 1955 "The Man With The Golden Arm" 
Preminger introduced drug addiction. In the 1959 "Anatomy of a Murder" 
detailed talk of sex and panties as courtroom evidence broke more 
taboos.</P>
<P>Near the end of TCC, Susie Bright and Susan Sarandon make cogent remarks 
about the non-menacing nature of female couples as opposed to male 
twosomes. They and others also discuss the bowdlerization of films to 
this day. And gay filmmaker Jan Oxenberg, analyzing "Philadelphia" says 
that it was "still a story about a gay hero who dies, who's a tragic 
figure. It remains to be seen whether Hollywood or the general public 
will embrace a film with a gay hero who lives."</P>
<P>It is true that the doors of the celluloid closet have mostly opened in 
films by independent filmmakers rather than from studios. Even so, TCC 
overwhelmingly relies for its examples on studio movies and Hollywood 
ones at that. Yet it is a documentary of major importance. Its subject 
is so compelling and encompassing that I wish the film had been much 
longer than its 102 minutes; that it had also the time to survey the 
experimental movie scene ("Lot in Sodom" 1933, "Scorpio Rising" 1963) 
and the international one. Examples:  "Madchen in Uniform" 1931, and its 
French successor "Olivia," 1951, both by female directors. The British 
"A Taste of Honey" 1961, "Beckett " 1964, The Dresser" 1983. The films 
of the German Fassbinder and the Spaniard Almodovar. The Italian "The 
Damned" 1969, "Death in Venice" 1971, "The Conformist" 1971,  "A Special 
Day" 1977. The French "Going Places" 1974 and "Menage" 1986. The 
Hungarian "Another Way" 1982 and "Colonel  Redl" 1984. The Canadian 
"I've Heard the Mermaids Singing" 1987. The Mexican films by Jaime 
Humberto Hermosillo ("Dona Herlinda and Her Son" 1986). </P>
<P>Anyone listening? TCC Part II ought to be another winner.</P>
