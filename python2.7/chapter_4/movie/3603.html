<P>     At the beginning of the 20th century, Hawaii's economy was 
dominated by the output of its sugar cane plantations.  To boost 
production, plantation owners imported workers from China, Japan, Korea, 
the Philippines, and other countries.  Men arrived in droves, with 
illusions of getting rich.  Reality, of course, was far from the dream, 
and the immigrant workers had little choice but to accept their lot and 
limit their expectations to what was realistic.  So, instead of wealth, 
they sought the comfort and stability of a family.  Attaining even this 
modest goal proved difficult, however, as Hawaii lacked an abundance of 
available women.  The eventual solution was the concept of the "photo 
marriage"--arranged matches established through photographs and 
letters sent between the plantation workers and their prospective 
partners across the sea.</P>
<P>     More than 20,000 picture brides came to Hawaii between 1907 and 
1924, primarily from Japan and Korea.  Most were young and, armed only 
with a photograph of their intended groom, they arrived to find hardship 
and disillusionment.  In person, the men often bore little resemblance 
to their black-and-white representations, and the day-to-day work that 
awaited the new wives was grueling.  City girls especially had a hard 
time coping.</P>
<P>     Writer/director Kayo Hatta spent five years researching stories of 
the picture brides, and at one point considered producing a documentary 
rather than a feature.  In the end, however, she blended real-life 
anecdotes with historical facts to form what is, in essence, a simple 
love story.  Hatta tells her tale with a heartfelt sincerity that comes 
across on the screen, and the Hawaii of the early 1900s is realistically 
portrayed.  PICTURE BRIDE has its faults, but artifice and melodrama are 
not among them.  </P>
<P>     The title character is Riyo (Youki Kudoh), a 16-year old girl from 
Yokohama who has come to Hawaii to escape her past and begin a new 
future with Matsuji (Akira Takayama).  When she first meets her husband-
to-be, she is shocked:  the aging plantation worker barely resembles the 
young man in her photograph.  Somewhat shamefacedly, Matsuji admits that 
he didn't have a good recent likeness, so he sent one taken a long time 
ago.</P>
<P>     The marriage starts on shaky ground.  Riyo will not sleep with 
Matsuji, and thinks of nothing but earning the money to return to Japan.  
With wages of about $11 a month, however, raising the necessary $300 
seems an impossible task.  And, as Matsuji informs her, "After a while 
you think of the homeland less and less.  Going back to Japan becomes an 
old dream."  Kana (Tamlyn Tomita), a veteran worker of the cane fields 
who also came to Hawaii as a picture bride, befriends Riyo and attempts 
to bring a little harmony to her unsettled marriage.</P>
<P>     With a congenial tone and fresh historical backdrop, PICTURE BRIDE 
maintains a pleasing balance between sweetness and poignancy.  Hatta has 
used a group of talented actors who grace this film with strong, 
restrained performances.  There is even a cameo by the legendary Toshiro 
Mifune.  The photography, by LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE cinematographer 
Claudio Rocha, shows off Hawaii, both the cane fields and the "real 
paradise", to its best advantage. </P>
<P>     Character development is uneven.  Through much of PICTURE BRIDE, we 
feel like we're viewing the story rather than experiencing it.  We 
understand the motives of Riyo, Matsuji, and Kana, but moments of 
intimate identification are rare.  Hatta's tale is designed primarily as 
a series of narrative scenes; there aren't many sequences that reduce 
the distance between the inhabitants of the film and those watching it.  
There are times when the story moves almost too quickly.</P>
<P>     Like THE JOY LUCK CLUB, PICTURE BRIDE depicts the struggle of a 
strong-willed, female Asian-American protagonist.  As an attempt to re-
create a segment of Hawaii's colorful history, this film is extremely 
effective.  As a love story, it is only marginally less so.  You don't 
have to be of Asian descent to appreciate the difficulties of bridging 
the gap between Riyo and Matsuji.  For Kayo Hatta, PICTURE BRIDE 
represents a satisfying culmination to a labor of love.</P>
