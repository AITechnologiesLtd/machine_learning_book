                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     JUPITER'S WIFE is a documentary that often reminds the viewer of a 
real-life detective story.  This isn't a search for a criminal, however; 
it's an attempt to sift through one woman's personal mythology to 
uncover the truth -- who she once was and what happened to make her the 
person she is today.  Some of the things discovered by film maker Michel 
Negroponte are truly amazing, and give us cause to ponder the strange 
workings of fate.  Of all the people to randomly pick for a documentary, 
the director chose one with tiny snippets of her life already preserved 
for posterity. </P>
<P>     One day several years ago, Negroponte ventured into New York's 
Central Park to do some preliminary photography for a documentary on the 
history of the park.  One of the people he interviewed was Maggie, a 
homeless woman who claimed to be the daughter of actor Robert Ryan and 
the wife of the Roman god Jupiter.  Negroponte was so intrigued by 
Maggie that he decided to build his film around her.  JUPITER'S WIFE 
became a portrait of this fascinating woman and a chronicle of the 
director's efforts to unearth her elusive, tantilizing past. </P>
<P>     As a character study, JUPITER'S WIFE is no more or less engrossing 
than dozens of similar films.  It's Negroponte's detective work that 
makes the movie worth sitting through.  Generally, it's easy to be bored 
by this sort of motion picture, but not in this case.  The film maker's 
enthusiasm overcomes technical deficiencies and an amateurish style 
(JUPITER'S WIFE was shot on video for a budget of about $500).  For 
emotional impact or sheer intellectual appeal, this movie doesn't 
approach a HOOP DREAMS or BROTHER'S KEEPER, but its depiction of Maggie 
makes for worthwhile viewing. </P>
