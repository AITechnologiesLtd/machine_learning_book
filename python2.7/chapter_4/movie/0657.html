                                    HALLOWEEN 5
                       A film review by Kenneth W. Smith, Jr.
                        Copyright 1989 Kenneth W. Smith, Jr.</PRE>
<P>     So far, there hasn't been much response on the net to HALLOWEEN 5,
not that horror get *that* much attention anyway.  The "Phantom"'s review and a
couple of subsequent articles are all that has been posted, that I have seen,
and all of the above relate what a letdown the movie is/was.  Hold on, here
comes a different opinion.</P>
<P>     I must admit that I went to see Michael's latest jaunt with a good deal of
skepticism.  I think that *any* sequel can lend this feeling to even the most
ardent fan of a particular series.  However, I was not disappointed at all with
this film.</P>
<P>     Addressing the most befuddling part of the film, the ending, seems to be
appropriate for going first.  The appearance of the stranger in black, and the
brief glimpses of his travels through Haddonfield, is given no explanation, but
there are a few hints given in the film about his/her/its link to Mr.  Myers.
We are shown that they both possess an identical mark on the right wrist.  This
mark can also be seen briefly in the basement of the old Myers' house.  It can
be seen on a wall behind Dr. Loomis at one point.  Then, just as we thought
that Michael would be put away for good, (he looked so dejected to have had his
mask taken away from him!), the stranger clobbers everyone in the police
station, and apparently takes Michael with him!  Talk about membership having
its privileges!  My guess is, and I have heard nor read any rumor of this, that
the stranger is someone whom Michael met while in the asylum and inducted Myers
into some sort of occult circle.  Just a thought.</P>
<P>     *Anyway*, about the rest of the film.  I thought that the direction was
great.  The fast, flashy images at the beginning when Jamie (Danielle Harris)
was having her "Michael attack" and Loomis (Donald Pleasance) saved her from a
tracheotomy by seconds was well-acted, well-shot, and well-timed.  Some of the
stalking scenes were perhaps a tad long, but the eerieness that came across
from the claustrophobic shots (e.g., the laundry chute) and the shadow
manipulation (e.g., inside the barn) was very effectively done.</P>
<P>     I liked the script itself.  The producer, Moustapha Akkad, is doing a good
job of obtaining scripts that maintain and adhere to the storyline that
Carpenter set up in the first film.  Sure, they have taken a few liberties with
the Michael mythos, but the attempting to present a sequel that reaches even
*half* of the quality of an original is extremely difficult.  Certain story
aspects have to be altered.  Audience bias *against* sequels is probably the
most difficult hurdle to overcome.  (If you don't believe this to be a
prevalent factor, have someone mail you all of the articles posted during this
summer's sequelitis spree!  There were sequels condemned before they were seen
by posters to this group!)</P>
<P>     [In reference to some comments made by others,] I didn't see [the ending]
as a letdown as much as I saw it as an intriguing, if not bewildering at first,
bridge to the next film.  The producer(s) intend(s) to create an
honest-to-goodness serial out of these films, which basically they have been
anyway.  This type of transition, the introduction of characters without
explanation, helps to move the films out of the episodic nature and into that
of a true serial.  I think it is a neat idea!  (When I say episodic, I mean
each part is not contingent on any of the previous parts, e.g., the Indiana Jones
series).</P>
<P>        I hesitate to classify the "Halloween" series (at least the Myers
story) as "slasher."  The "Friday the 13th" movies have evolved into a slasher
series.  Slasher to me implies mindless, unmotivated, wholesale, slaughter.
Michael has motivation and is far from mindless.  His whole motivation is
sexual, as established by the first film and used throughout the rest.  He is
psychotic, true, and I think that possession, at least according to the
Halloween novelization, is the result of the mental snap he had during the
first scene of the first film.  (One dead sister, not babysitter.  How many
babysitters sit nude in someone else's bedroom using their hair brush?  Don't
answer that....)  
     Also, there is a lot more going on here than a simple stalk-'em-slash-'em
story here.  The director and writers present more than just a psycho offing
everyone he finds (which he isn't doing anyway.).  Take for example the barn
sex scene.  Did they have the eventually pitchforked guy wear a Michael suit
and mask simply for the prank pulled on the policemen?  I think that the suit,
coupled with the guy coupling in the following scene, gave the audience a great
metaphor for Michael's condition in the first place!  Michael, seeing "himself"
doing what he himself can't do, and subsequently enrages him, puts an end to
seeing this by giving the faux-Myers a tine he would never forget.  (Sorry, I
couldn't resist that one...)  |) Otherwise, that kill would have had no
motivation behind it.</P>
<P>     If your main motivation for film-going is nudity then, yes, you will be
disappointed.  However, if you have enjoyed the Myers story to date, then this
continuation, soon to be a *true* continuation, should satisfy you for another
year or two.  I enjoyed it very much, especially getting to see Donald again.
If you enjoy a mental challenge and can appreciate good direction, writing, and
acting, then I highly recommend this film.  I intend to catch it again if and
when it comes to the cheaper/second-run theater here.</P>
