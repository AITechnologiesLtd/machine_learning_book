Stolen Hours (Reviewed on Aug. 25th/98)</PRE>
<PRE>Starring Susan Hayward</PRE>
<P>"Stolen Hours" asks a very intriguing question:  If you found out you had
only a year left in which to live your life, how would you live it?  It's
a question most people never want to think about, but one which the
central character of "Stolen Hours" is faced with.</P>
<P>Susan Hayward plays that character, a woman suffering from headaches and
minor paralysis, who discovers that she has a terminal form of brain
cancer and has 10 to 12 months to live.  She is tricked by some friends
into seeing a doctor at a party she is holding, and he ends up becoming
both her full-time physician and later on, her husband.</P>
<P>It's a tough subject and the film handles it well.  About halfway through,
I realized something.  I realized that I was watching a movie intended for
adults.  In this day and age when the 18-25 demographic is the most
important thing out there, it was a refreshing change to watch a movie
that was not meant for adolescents.  This is a film about the fear that
comes with knowing that the end is near.</P>
<P>Hayward handles the part excellently.  She doesn't get hysterical as one
might expect, but instead handles herself with a quiet dignity that is
almost heartbreaking.  She wants to get the audience to put themselves in
her place, to think about how information like that would change a persons
life.  She gives a very open and honest performance, and I didn't find any
inconsistencies in it.</P>
<P>"Stolen Hours" is the type of film that is rarely made anymore.  There are
no major conflicts within the story, no big revelations made, and no
useless sub-plots.  That's too bad, because movies like this are what make
watching movies interesting.  They make you think.</P>
<PRE>*** out of ****</PRE>
