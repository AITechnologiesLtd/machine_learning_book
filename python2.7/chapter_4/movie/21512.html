<PRE>IN SHORT: Best left unseen</PRE>
<P>If one must see only one Canadian film this year . . . wait until next
year and hope to see two better films than Last Night, a production that
approaches the quality of middle echelon college flicks. Meaning? Last
Night should've stayed on the festival circuit or the Sundance Channel.</P>
<P>At minimum, I'll give writer/actor Don McKellar credit for trying to
stretch himself as a director. While his first effort, Last Night, may
have been good training for what it takes to be a director, it has all
the looks of a fair to middling senior student project. All the
interesting stuff is tied up in the script, which, as with his work on
The Red Violin, shows where his strengths lie.</P>
<P>The concept is good: What would you do if the world was about to end? No
hope of salvation. No Bruce Willis to blow up his spaceship and save the
day. It's an idea fit for Millenium Fever, but the execution is
uninteresting.</P>
<P>McKellar's characters cover a good range of reaction save one: panic.
Patrick (McKellar) just wants to be alone, though he does suffer through
a final Christmas dinner with his family, unwrapping `presents' of
discarded toys of Christmas past. His sister Jennifer (Sarah Polley)
wants the dinner over with so she can go and party like there's no
tomorrow -- picture New Year's Eve in Times Square. The ball drops.
Everybody dies.</P>
<P><P>There's Sandra (Sandra Oh) whose efforts to get home for a
murder-suicide pact with her husband go astray when a mob trashes her
car. It's a long walk home, during which she meets Patrick and a sort of
friendship is formed. Patrick brings her to his best friend Craig
(Callum Keith Rennie) who has cars to spare. Craig also has a detailed
chart of every sexual activity, position and partner type that he can
think of, and is working his way down the list to the very end. Duncan
(David Cronenberg) works at the gas company, and calls every customer to
let them know that the gas will still be on all the way to the end.
That's about as clever as the film gets. Cronenberg's name should ring
some bells with you, as should French actress Genevieve Bujold, who has
a small part as one of the checkboxes on Craig's list.</P>
<P><P>All the while, an elderly marathoner runs through the empty streets
yelling out how much time is left at the top of her lungs. On the radio
a DJ is playing the `Greatest 500 Songs Of All Time,' including timeless
tunes by Burton Cummings, the DeFranco Family, The Looking Glass and
Edward Bear. The songs alone  would be enough to make any music lover
put a pistol in the mouth, but Last Night is a Canadian film and that's
Canadian content. The song list doesn't even come off as a sly bit of
satire, that's how remarkably unemotional and ineffective this flick is.</P>
<P><P>Last Night has the look of a 16mm shoot blown up to 35, on out of
date stock. That may have been intentional, to visually represent
something, but Cranky ain't smart enough to figure that out. It looks
like a student film. Its actors have very little idea of what they're
supposed to mean in the big scheme of things.  Cranky will ignore the
special effects part of his brain that says: how is the Earth going to
die? Is it falling into the sun? Is it getting hit by an asteroid? Where
are the gravitational effects? because the budget is too low to pay for
'em. Actually, the budget is too low to pay for much of anything.
There's little emotional conflict of any kind in the family scenes (has
the government spiked the water supply with valium?) and no character
performance in the overall story to sympathize with. Last Night is the
kind of flick fit for obscure film festivals where prizes are given as
freely as pats on the backs for getting the product made.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Last Night, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$1.00</PRE>
<P>Cranky liked McKellar's writing in Red Violin, though on that project
there was a collaborator. Didn't like it here. Didn't believe the
characters. Didn't believe the situations. Doesn't believe you should
spend your cash.</P>
