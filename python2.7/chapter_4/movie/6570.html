<PRE>                               TWELFTH NIGHT
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is a light rollicking
          Shakespeare comedy turned leaden and dour
          apparently intentionally by director Trevor Nunn.
          The 1890s look creates some logical problems for
          the film without doing anything interesting to the
          meaning of the story.  Dim lighting and overly
          restrained performances sap nearly all the spirit
          out of a play that is usually a lot of fun.
          Rating: high 0 (-4 to +4).
          New York Critics: 10 positive, 1 negative, 6 mixed.</PRE>
<P>     This is the film to take a Shakespeare fan to see so he will
understand why so many people do not care for Shakespeare.  Trevor Nunn
put a lot of unconventional touches into this TWELFTH NIGHT.  He took
risks and in many cases demonstrated just how they were risks.  I
previously saw TWELFTH NIGHT performed in a San Jose park by a bunch of
unknowns who passed a hat at the end.  And I saw the Trevor Nunn film
with respected professionals and highly paid name actors.  It is
surprising how much better the play was done in the park.  Nunn is a
director whom I have respected in the past.  He directed the TV version
of THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF NICHOLAS NICKLEBY, the film LADY JANE,
and more recently the PBS "Les Miserables in Concert."  Each is good,
and each is downbeat in tone.  Perhaps that is the only tone with which
Nunn feels comfortable, but TWELFTH NIGHT is about as downbeat a
treatment as we could expect from this comedy.</P>
<P>     The first of the problems is that Nunn had moved the story to the
late 19th century for no apparent reason and adding no value to the
story.  A year ago Ian McKellan did a magnificent updating of RICHARD
III, giving the film not just a beautiful look, but adding a great deal
to the meaning of the story.    No reason for the updated setting here
is apparent and in some cases clothing details required by the story
just do not fit with the dress of the characters in the film.  While we
are on the subject of the look of the film, the dim lighting does odd
things to the tone of the film.  Nunn chooses to light very much like
this is a film noir production. There are a few sunlit scenes, but a
great deal of the film seems to take place in semi-darkness with
characters having half of their faces lit, the other half fading into
the darkness of the background. Frequently there is one bright source
of light in a scene and the rest is bathed in black.  In a crime film
it would have worked very nicely because it lends a powerful downbeat
and oppressive feel.  Using that sort of lighting in a light comedy is
creative, but the effect fights what should be the tone of a film with
characters like Sir Toby Belch (played by broad comedic actor Mel
Smith) and Sir Andrew Aguecheek (Richard E. Grant of "Franz Kafka's
It's a Wonderful Life").</P>
<P>     The plot is as complex as many of Shakespeare's comedies.  Viola
and Sebastian are identical twins who are shipwrecked separately in a
place called Illyria.  Each is unaware that the other has survived, and
each goes into the service of one of two rival dukes.  In order to do
this Viola has to dress as and pretend to be a man. She apparently does
it very well since the Countess Olivia (Helena Bonham Carter) falls in
love with her, thinking her to be a man.  You can imagine the
possibilities that a Shakespeare (or for that matter a Mozart) would
see in male and female twins, otherwise identical and now actually
identical since both now appear to be male.  The Bard has his usual fun
with mistaken identities and odd love alliances.   For additional humor
Shakespeare has peppered the plot with characters who often have
humorous names and a subplot involving a puritanical servant, Malvolio
(Nigel Hawthorne).</P>
<P>     Viola is played by Imogen Stubbs who gets surprisingly low billing
considering that she really is the main character.  Her best known role
is as Lucy Steele in SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, though if the reader wants
to make a terrific film discovery, I can suggest her earlier A SUMMER
STORY.  Stubbs has the talent for the role, but has a hard time making
herself even look like a man, much less make herself mistakable for
Stephen Mackintosh, who plays her twin brother Sebastian.  There is one
really stunning performance in the film, and even that is not entirely
obvious until the end: Nigel Hawthorne is actually very good as
Malvolio.  In his last scene he manages to turn much of the play
upside-down.   Another very good actor is used to much less effect.
Ben Kingsley plays a sort of narrator and chorus, Feste.  In the
original he was the court fool, here turned into a wandering minstrel.
This gives Kingsley what I think is his first and hopefully only
singing role.  Rounding out the cast is Helena Bonham Carter in a less
pouting role than most of hers, but not one with which she did a whole
lot.  There is a lot of comedy in the play, but somehow nothing seems
all that funny on the screen, due in large part to the restrained
performances of the cast and the dour feel of the lighting.</P>
<P>     Trevor Nunn's version of TWELFTH NIGHT does some things original
but not a lot that really improve on the material.  I rate it a high 0
on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
