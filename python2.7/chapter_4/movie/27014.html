<P>I'm a big believer in that not every movie reviewer should be critiquing
every film that passes through the cinema. Does it really make sense for a
50-year old man to write a review about a "kid's movie"? I personally don't
think so. If Roger Ebert hates AMERICAN PIE, does it mean that its target
audience of teenagers will not appreciate the film? I highly doubt it. I
personally try to skip those films to which I do not believe I could truly
inject an insightful piece of criticism.</P>
<P>I didn't see RUGRATS IN PARIS and I will not see Russian epics, because
chances are that I will not be able to bring up anything constructive in my
reviews. In other words, I doubt that my opinion would help a reader decide
on those films either way. Also, it isn't really fair to the filmmakers to
review a movie that is simply NOT made for you. With all that in mind, I'm
writing this review as a test of sorts. Will I be able to bring up anything
that might change the minds of anyone out there in this film audience's
target market? (i.e. 4-10 years old kids) Let's see.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Cruella De Vil is getting out of jail, rehabilitated. She no longer loves
fur, she no longer hates dogs, and she is no longer a mean and all-around
nasty human being. That's until her good "spell" disappears and she returns
to the cruelty by which we have all grown to love her. It's now up to her
cohorts to round up 102 dalmation dogs, so that Cruella could make a nice
fur jacket out of them.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A slow start, a stringy romance and strong English accents shouldn't
dissuade many children from loving this movie, due primarily to a
scene-stealing parakeet and its last thirty minutes of uproarious fun. I
can't really say whether or not this was a good movie or not, because you
can only rate this type of film according to what it is trying to achieve.
This movie wants to make kids ooooh and aaaaah, and most of the cute dogs
and funny lines from the parrot work to do just that. Unfortunately, the
first half of this film moves a little too slow. It concentrates a little
too much on the dinky romance between the two leads, which will likely bore
kids, and doesn't give us enough good ol' fashioned cruelty from Cruella!
Thankfully, it is the film's final thirty minutes or so which pack all of
its punch, with dogs being snatched, people getting hit in the head and
Cruella going all out to get what she wants! You gotta hand it to Glenn
Close on this one, she is absolutely perfect for the part. She looks the
part, she acts the part and she obviously loves to play the part. Cruella
wasn't necessarily as nasty as she could have been in this film, but despite
that observation from big ol' adult me, I did still manage to hear a little
kid bawling his eyes out during one of the final dog-catching scenes. So who
knows...maybe she's a monster to these kids?!</P>
<P>On the whole, the film works mostly because of its use of cute dogs doing
neat tricks, the talking parrot, who is absolutely hilarious (Go, Eric
Idle!) and the last half of the film, which combines all the pratfalls from
other kiddie movies, and a finale straight out of this summer's CHICKEN RUN.
Just think: chicken pies. Wink-wink! So if you're looking for a film to
bring your youngens, I don't think you can go too wrong with this flick.
It's harmless and it doesn't necessarily "change" a modern American
classical tale or give the reigns to a comedic genius who turns the lead
role into something other than what the role was meant to be...uuuhm, but I
digress. What movie were we talking about again? The Grinch? Oh no, 102
DALMATIANS. Either way, I don't think my little review or you, as a parent,
trying to talk your kids out of seeing this movie is gonna work, so why
bother. If your kid wants to see this movie, let 'em go see it...it
certainly won't hurt. If you're an adult and you wanna see this movie,
well...uuuhmmm, grow up! :)</P>
<P>Actually, it's more than likely that most adults will also appreciate the
parrot and Glenn Close's performance. Mrs. JoBlo loved it! Scored it an
8/10. What's up with that? Do I hear 103 Dalmatians, anyone? Disney will
definitely let us know after the weekend box-office tallies.</P>
