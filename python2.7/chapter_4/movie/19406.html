<P>Gonzo for Gonzo? Then you'll absolutely adore "Muppets From Space," this
decade's third film featuring Jim Henson's infamously accessible and
diverse puppet troupe. But unlike 1992's "The Muppet Christmas Carol" or
1996's "Muppet Treasure Island," both of which felt forced in their
attempts to mix classic lit with mad Muppet sensibilities, "Space" cooks
up a brand new - and totally timely - premise for our favorite felt
friends to joke, mug and flail their way through. It's a worthy
successor to 1979's "The Muppet Movie," 1981's "The Great Muppet Caper"
and 1985's "The Muppets Take Manhattan."</P>
<P>As for that blue, furry, hook-nosed whatchamacallit called Gonzo,
admiring him is mandatory in enjoying this "Space" trip. He - not
Kermit, not Miss Piggy - gets the lead role here, his dilemma grabbing
the spotlight following a rousing, if out-of-nowhere, opening production
number set to the still-hip '70s staple "Brick House." Seems Gonzo,
suffering from a huge identity crisis, has been overcome with a question
that's also been haunting fans for quite some time: We know Rolf's a
dog, Fozzie's a bear and Sam's an eagle, but into what genus and species
does the G-man fall? A word of advice: Don't think too hard about the
title if you'd like to keep all the related revelations a surprise.</P>
<P>His quest for answers takes him and his Muppet pals through their
patented mix of physical comedy, surprise celebrity cameos (like David
Arquette as a mad scientist) and pop culture spoofs galore. Streetwise
Rizzo the Rat, Gonzo's right-hand rodent, tags along as usual, providing
an amusingly sarcastic counterpoint to his frazzled friend's neurotic
natterings. Crave new territory? A few neophyte characters receive
memorable debuts, including affable grizzly Bobo, a distressingly Andy
Warhol-esque butler and a Latino shrimp named Pepe who makes up for his
diminutive size with an abundance of sharp barbs.</P>
<P>Predictably, the lone main non-Muppet player - Jeffery Tambor's hammy
villain, a shady type out to cage Gonzo for government purposes - is a
snooze. And most non-Gonzo old favorites get relegated to supporting
subplots, which is the case with one-time Muppet ringleader Kermit and
spotlight-hogger Miss Piggy. But the background suits them fine for at
least this endeavor. "Muppets From Space" creates such a lively,
diverting atmosphere that this potentially faulty switcheroo registers
only in afterthought. Any film that pulls off a
worth-the-price-of-admission "Dawson's Creek" jab, a Piggy-MacDowell
catfight and yet another big musical showstopper in the same 10 minutes
can't be too dull.</P>
<P>With a fine balance between mirth and message and relatively few lulls
hampering viewer merriment, kids will identify with the alienation
themes and relish the silly slapstick while adults are kept amused by
parodies of classic sci-fi and the suspicious mentality of the "X-Files"
'90s. This means that "Muppets From Space" is truly a family film that
fits the classic - but typically over-applied - commendation: Young and
old can enjoy it together. Except for those crass, curmudgeonly seniors
Statler and Waldorf. They'll heckle anything. Maybe a Muppet retirement
community should be in their future.<HR></P>

"'20 Dates' tells the story of Myles Berkowitz, a man who wants to make
a film, and to fall in love. These areas are his ‘two greatest failures,
professional and personal,' so he decides to make a film about going out
on 20 dates. By the film's end, he has won the love of the lovely
Elisabeth - maybe - but his professional life is obviously still a
failure." -Roger Ebert on "20 Dates"</P>
