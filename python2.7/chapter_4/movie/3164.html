<PRE>                              THE JUNGLE BOOK
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Disney Films borrows some character
          names from Kipling, but not any story.  Spectacular
          Indian locations, beautiful photography, and a
          powerful score are wasted on a mediocre and cliched
          adventure film with little respect for the Kipling
          it was nominally based on.  Rating: low +1 (-4 to
          +4)</PRE>
<P>     An old cartoon shows someone asking "Do you like Kipling?" and
getting the response "I don't know, I never Kipled."  Certainly there
is not much Kipling going on in Disney's sumptuous second film
nominally based on Rudyard Kipling's THE JUNGLE BOOKS.  [Am I the only
one who thinks the book's title was in the plural?]  Indeed, while
Kipling might enjoy the new film for its stupendous vision of India,
with the exception of recognizing a few character names, mostly
animals, he would find little in this film to remind him of his own
writings either in plot or style.  Besides Mowgli himself, the major
characters of his Mowgli stories are all animals; in the film the
animals are minor characters.  The new film gives a (highly inaccurate)
origin for Mowgli and then entirely skips over the period that the book
covers and returns to Mowgli as an adult (now played by Jason Scott
Lee).   Mowgli has picked up martial arts someplace and is now ready to
interact with the Man-pack.  In fact when he does what we have has is
much more the plotting of a Tarzan movie with the setting moved to
India.  But even if that is so, admittedly it is a highly watchable
Tarzan movie.</P>
<P>     In the Kipling, Mowgli is a baby who has strayed from his village
and nearly killed by Shere Khan, the great tiger.  The Man-cub is
raised by wolves.  In the new film version, Mowgli is about five years
old and already has facility handling elephants when he is separated
from his caravan and thought to have been killed.  Why he has never
returned to civilization remains unexplained since he seems to have a
city with a major fort just a day or two's walk away.  However, he
remains in his jungle until he sees and is attracted to Catherine (Lena
Headly), the beautiful daughter of the commander of the fort (Sam
Neill).  She is already being courted by a handsome young soldier (Cary
Elwes) who is a favorite of the commander, but of course the audience
knows that he is a treacherous cad and a bounder to boot.  When the
nasty young soldier realizes that Mowgli must know the way to a
legendary lost treasure city, all the expected happens.</P>
<P>     On top of the plotting being sophomoric, it is didactic.
Kipling's animals live by the Law of the Jungle, a complex and logical
code which includes rules like not to kill Man as well as rules like
when it is legal to take another's prey.  In this version it is changed
into modernistic rules of conservation.  The major rule is "do not kill
what you cannot eat."  And the animals enforce these rules on humans.
In fact, Mowgli is first stranded in the jungle when Shere Khan attacks
his caravan because the travelers had killed more animals than they
could eat.  (This is an heroic and selfless action for Shere Khan ...
totally out of character.)  The heroes of THE JUNGLE BOOK all seem to
have late 20th Century American values while the villains are all
politically incorrect.</P>
<P>     Another interesting problem with the film is the placing of jungle
so near the fort.  (In fact, the fortress is Jodhpur's breath-taking
Meherangarh Fort.  Having explored the 15th Century fort myself--
perhaps the term "walled city" is more accurate--I can tell you the
name Meherangarh, or "majestic," is no exaggeration.  But perhaps the
film makes that obvious.)  Even if the fort is supposed to be just some
generic fort, the architecture is Rajasthani.  You will probably see
that style only in dry country a very long distance from any tropical
jungle such as we see in other parts of this story.  The decision to
film the fort over-looking Jodhpur is purely an aesthetic one.  This is
a very beautifully photographed film.  The clarity and detail of the
shots and the use of color may be the best of any film I have seen this
year.  Disney Studios has a reputation for making high-quality prints.
The score by the underrated Basil Polidouris only adds to the lush and
rich texture.</P>
<P>     The acting, as directed by Stephen Sommers, is generally
acceptable though Jason Scott Lee is an odd casting choice for Mowgli.
He does not look so much Indian as Oriental.  Cary Elwes makes a
reasonable villain who snidely personifies all that was wrong with the
British Raj.  Unfortunately, some of the worst acting comes from the
animals who just followed direction without worrying about their
careers--more is the pity.  The apes in particular behave like
fugitives from the Cheetah School of Bad Animal Acting.  And I wonder
what an orangutan is doing in the jungles of India.  Rudyard Kipling
treated the animals as characters but in this film the apes are sort of
a Greek chorus and the rest are little more than additional fists for
Mowgli to use against his enemies.</P>
<P>     Taken as a Tarzan film or a sequel to the Kipling story, this is a
watchable children's film.  But putting Kipling's name over the title
is gross mis-representation.  The pity is that such care was taken with
the visual aspects of a film so betrayed by the scripting.  Parts of
this film are terrific, parts are just awful.  On balance this one gets
a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
