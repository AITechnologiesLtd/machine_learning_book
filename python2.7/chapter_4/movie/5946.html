<P>     Chelsea Clinton must have it rough.  In addition to dealing with 
all the normal problems of adolescence, she has the added pressure of 
constantly being in the world's spotlight.  And, unlike child movie and 
TV stars, this isn't something she chose -- it's a role that was thrust 
upon her.  Though it may be slim consolation, at least her situation 
isn't as bleak as that of Luke Davenport (Brock Pierce), the title 
character of Disney's latest lame-brained live-action feature, FIRST 
KID.  Not only does he have a similar home situation to Chelsea, but, on 
top of that, he gets publically humiliated by a school bully (Zachary Ty 
Bryan) and threatened by a gun-weilding psycho at the mall.</P>
<P>     To me, the concept of making a movie about the child of a president 
seems like a good idea.  There's a dramatic goldmine inherent in the 
situation.  The teen years are a time of rebellion; how does a 
presidential son or daughter react to having their every minor 
infraction appear on the nightly news?  And much does it hurt to see 
their father and mother's names dragged through the mud?  While a great 
film could be made from this subject matter, FIRST KID isn't it.  Disney 
doesn't want hard-hitting, WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE-type realism.  They 
want lightweight, feel-good family fare -- the kind of movie that can 
turn a modest profit without offending anyone.</P>
<P>     Part of the problem is that, despite the title, this film isn't so 
much about the First Son as it is about his secret agent, Sam Simms.  
Simms is played by Sinbad, and this is obviously a vehicle for the 
comic-turned-actor.  In fact, it's his second starring role for Disney -
- he last appeared in the wretched HOUSEGUEST, which played like a 
feature-length commercial for McDonalds.  Not to be outdone this time 
around, Sinbad has two significant product plugs:  one for Duncan Donuts 
and one for Coca Cola.  You'd have to be blind or asleep to miss either.</P>
<P>     The story, shallow and feeble as it is, has 13-year old Luke going 
off to high school during an election year.  Luke is resentful that his 
parents (James Naughton and Lisa Eichorn) are always out on the campaign 
trail, and he takes out his frustration on the Secret Service agents 
assigned to protect him.  Agent Woods (Timothy Busfield) loses his job, 
and his replacement, Simms (who already has "a file full of borderline 
regulation infractions"), is headed in the same direction until he makes 
a remarkable discovery.  All Luke really wants is a friend.  So, by 
becoming co-conspirators in breaking White House rules (they sneak off 
to a Washington gym where Luke takes boxing lessons), they develop a 
deep and meaningful bond.  Meanwhile, at school, Luke falls for a pretty 
classmate (Erin Williby) and suffers all the typical anxiety of asking 
her out on a date.</P>
<P>     Not everything in FIRST KID is bad.  There are times when we feel 
for Luke, although never as deeply as we should.  It probably would have 
helped if he hadn't started out the film as such a dislikeable brat.  
And some of Sinbad's comic antics can't help but be funny -- this guy 
has got an abundance of charisma.  Unfortunately, comedy and light drama 
aren't the only things on FIRST KID's agenda.  The film ends with an 
extended action sequence that is (unintentionally) more laughable than 
Sinbad's best routine.  We get to see the star do his Clint Eastwood 
imitation by getting IN THE LINE OF FIRE.</P>
<P>     By aiming his film at children, director David Mickey Evans strips 
the movie of all potentially interesting elements, leaving behind 
material likely to appeal to only the least discriminating viewers.  
Then again, most Disney live-action features are about the same, so 
there shouldn't be any real surprises where FIRST KID is concerned.  The 
just-completed Democratic National Convention was better-scripted than 
this film.</P>
