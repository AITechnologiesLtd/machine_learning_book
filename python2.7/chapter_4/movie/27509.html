<PRE>"Who doesn't dream of satisfying every spasm of lust?" 
Quills</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>Paris seventeen ninety-four, a criminally insane man scribbles out 
barely pornographic, cheap, lust novels masked with poetic sounding 
prose. Aided by a chambermaid at the asylum, the books make print with 
copies selling faster than prostitution. </P>
<P>The film begins with a very nicely filmed execution scene and a 
bloodthirsty observation, "How quickly pleasure is taken from one and 
given to others." The sex-guilty maiden is fitted to the guillotine as 
the townsfolk enjoy the festivities. </P>
<P>Soon the crazy Count demands a warmer form of payment from the maid 
(Kate Winslet), "A kiss a page!" </P>
<P>Winslet coyly replies, "May I blow them or must I administer them?" She 
then asks if there's room for negotiation, to which the Rush smugly 
expounds, "The price is every bit as firm as I am." </P>
<P>It's a festival of snobbish, yet still plainly sophomoric puns. Though, 
I chuckled a few times, these were rarely due to the double entendres. </P>
<P>Surprisingly and inappropriately, a serious film erupts from between the 
buttocks of this Shakespearean-like farce. The Abby in charge of the 
Asylum and the crazy Count debate human nature "To eat, sh*t, f*ck," the 
Count insists. Countering the Count, the Abby offers, "To fall in love." </P>
<P>But the staid half of the production relies too heavily on vanity as a 
motivating force for every turn, mudballing the film into a mucky 
progression of farcical twists that never seems to stop rolling. The 
film itself becomes like the Terminator. Seeming ending after seeming 
ending, it just won't die. </P>
<P>Rumor had it that this is a sexy picture. Eek, about as sexy as 
necrophilia. The lewd fable proves an inhospitable host for the more 
meaty conflict between priest and pervert. "Have you no faith in your 
own mission?" Rush bitingly asks the Abby, ... a great poke toward a 
subplot that unfortunately drowns in the muddle. </P>
<P>Though the performances are fair and the costuming & sets very nice; 
these characters have no depth. All but Rush's are mere whims of the 
author, vehicles for pointless plot twists. Simply stated, the film is a 
cheap novel itself with an insulting attempt at a moral stapled on at 
its end. I'm not appalled by the vulgarity ... I'm appalled by the lack 
of entertainment. </P>
