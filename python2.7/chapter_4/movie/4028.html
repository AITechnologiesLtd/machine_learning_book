<PRE>KIDS
====</PRE>
<P>Once you get past the novelty of their uncensored (and unrated) 
behavior, the remarkable first film from celebrated photographer Larry 
Clark becomes a bit of a bore.  Though realistic enough to qualify as 
a documentary, the *extremely* explicit story skirts dangerously close 
to the one-note repetition of pornography.  (Which some will label 
this film as.)  </P>
<P>KIDS is compelling, but cold.  There's very little joy in the lives of 
these promiscuous, drug-abusing Manhattan teens.  I'd like to see a 
greater contrast between the "adult" abusive behaviors and the 
"children" performing them.  Alas, this is Clark's vision of hell, and 
his sermon has no place for poignancy.  </P>
<PRE>Grade: B+</PRE>
<PRE>MORTAL KOMBAT
=============</PRE>
<P>A single hour of this was plenty for me.  Too much talk; too little  
action.  (And poorly filmed at that.)  Far more interesting were the  
male patrons who began grunting as the MORTAL KOMBAT theme played over  
the opening credits.  Perhaps experiencing some sort of post-video  
combat stress syndrome?  Great theme music, tho.</P>
<PRE>THE PROPHECY
============</PRE>
<P>Screenwriter Gregory Widen (BACKDRAFT, HIGHLANDER) makes his directing 
debut with a modestly engaging religious thriller that wouldn't have 
been out of place 20 years ago as a follow-up to THE EXORCIST.  Now, 
in the nineties, where standards are *much* higher, plot problems and 
cheap FX nearly sink the fascinating premise of renegade angels waging 
a millennia-old war on Earth.  (The situation isn't helped by that 
awful, ambiguous title.  The original-- GOD'S ARMY-- was much better.)</P>
<P>Christopher Walken stars as Gabriel, horn player extraordinare and 
leader of the rogue seraphs.  He's delightfully wicked in his cross-
country search for the "blackest" of human souls.  Also watch Viggo 
Mortensen, sinister fun as the late-arriving Lucifier.  Less appealing 
is the opposition.  The good guys include Simon (Eric Stoltz) and his 
human helper Thomas Dagget (Elias Koteas), a former priest-turned-
police investigator.  Both are a bore.</P>
<PRE>Grade: C+</PRE>
<PRE>THE USUAL SUSPECTS
==================</PRE>
<P>I don't know if you'll find a better film in local theaters this 
week than Bryan Singer's THE USUAL SUSPECTS.  His tale of a "heist 
gone bad" is told in detailed flashback, as part of an interrogation 
between the sole surviving participant (Kevin Spacey) and a very-
interested investigator (Chazz Palminteri).  These two are the anchors 
of a top-notch ensemble cast that includes Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel 
Byrne, Kevin Pollack, Pete Postlethwaite, Benicio Del Toro, and Dan 
Hedaya.</P>
<P>The convoluted plot requires a second viewing to fully appreciate the 
intricacies of Christopher McQuarrie's ingenious screenplay.  Hint: 
take notes.  However confusing to the uninitiated, THE USUAL SUSPECTS 
rewards on more levels than I choose to describe here.  My favorite is 
the lush score by John Ottman, who, oddly enough, also edited the 
picture.  Recommended.</P>
<PRE>Grade: A-</PRE>
<PRE>TO WONG FOO
===========</PRE>
<P>The first mainstream American "drag comedy"-- call it our answer to 
PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT-- is neither sassy nor subtle enough to 
be *really* funny.  (Think "drag light.")  What you *do* get is the 
remarkably amusing sight of macho macho men Wesley Snipes and Patrick 
Swayze in high heels and make-up.  They're good for more than a few 
laughs; maybe more than Middle America is completely comfortable with.</P>
<P>The elongated title (TO WONG FOO, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING, JULIE NEWMAR) 
refers to the inscription on a celebrity photo that the "girls" take 
with them on a cross-country car trip that lands them broken-down and 
detoured in a tiny midwestern town.  Sound familiar?  Of course, no 
one there has a lick of fashion sense, much less the ability to 
recognize a man dressed as a woman.  [ Insert "Wonder Woman" theme. ]</P>
<P>What ensues is mild hilarity-with-a-message, such as a local yokel 
with a crush on John Leguizamo.  (He plays the third wheel, Chi Chi 
Rodriguez, a whiny Hispanic queen who is already putting Rosie Perez 
out of work.)  Also pay attention to Chris Penn, a scene-stealer as 
the hilariously homophobic Sheriff Dollard.</P>
