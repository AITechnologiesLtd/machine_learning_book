<PRE>What Hath Oprah Wrought?</PRE>
<PRE>Review of Beloved (1998)</PRE>
<P>Seen on Halloween 1998 by myself at the SONY Loews Orpheum for $8.75</P>
<P>One of the rules by which I judge a screen adaptation i that the director
make sure the movie stands on its own merits, and not the novels from
which they are derived.</P>
<P>Oprah Winfrey has touted *Beloved* as a *Schindler's List* for
African-Americans. It fails where the other succeeds. To understand the
horrors of the Holocaust, they were shown. In *Beloved*, the horrors of
slavery are not shown as often as they are referenced in many flashbacks.
Much more time is spent being horrified by the past, which is unveiled in
a slow, plodding manner that stalls in the metaphysical mishmash of it's
presentation.</P>
<P>The storyline jumps around: It opens in 1855 with the haunting of a black
family in Ohio. A deadly ghost is present. Then, the story jumps ahead to
eight years in the future, where Sethe (Oprah Winfrey) lives in isolation
with her daughter Denver (Kimberly Elise) when Paul D (Danny Glover)
arrives from out of nowhere. He is a fellow former slave from "Sweet
Home"--the plantation where he and Sethe once toiled. Why they almost
immediately have sex is inexplicable, as are many elements of this
ultimately disappointing film.</P>
<P>Out of the bogswamp arrives Beloved (Thandie Newton), who is either
fashioned by insects or just very at home with nature. She cannot talk and
is a mystery to the entire family, but she becomes a (strange) part of the
family--a sister for the lonely Denver, and a replacement daughter for
Sethe's lost infant. But sibling rivalries flare up as Beloved gravitates
to Sethe, only to torment her.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, there are lots of flashbacks. Lots and lots of them. Maybe too
many? The most interesting is the story of a pregnant younger Sethe (well
played by Lisa Gay Hamilton, who looks *nothing* like Oprah's Sethe)
escaping the horrors (sexual abuse and the lynching of Sethe's mother) of
"Sweet Home" to go north to Ohio. She is befriended by a white woman (Amy
Denver, played by Kessia Randall) who helps her give birth and make it to
the home of her mother-in-law Baby Suggs (Beah Richards).</P>
<P>Jonathan Demme's direction cannot help the "stream of unconciousness" of
Toni Morrison's novel, which in turn is problematic. It took three writers
to adapt the screenplay. But Demme does some strange things along the way.
Clouds zip by in fast motion... why? There are some wonderful lingering
shots of the natural surroundings, and the most visually compelling scene
is the one in which Baby Suggs preaches to folks in the woods. Demme
bathes here in an overexposure that makes her golden.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Beloved (in an outstanding performance by Newton) spins out of
control, eating everything with two hands balled into fists, and running
around naked. Please don't ask why--I don't know. Maybe Oprah knows.</P>
<P>Unlike *Schindler's List*, *Beloved* is just a psychodrama on acid, that
fails to systematically explain slavery's horrors in a way that is
accessible. Too much is expected of the viewer; we are expected to know
historical conditions and the novel. A movie featuring characters named
Schoolteacher, Buglar, Running Boy, Stamp Paid, and the Thirty Women
should have been lyrical, haunting, poetic.  Instead, it's a thematic mess
that takes translates every aspect of the book with no explanation. Who
are the Thirty Women anyway? Why include them and not explain them?</P>
<P>What would have been a *fantastic* movie would have been to delve into the
relationship between Denver and her grandmother, the spiritual
preacherwoman Baby Suggs. The story unwisely centers on crazy Sethe when
the real gold lies in Denver's neglect, and her ability to rise above the
insanity of her upbringing and persevere.</P>
<P>Oh, and the movie's too long. But the music was nice.</P>
<P>Oprah Winfrey is one of the producers, and she plugged it endlessly to her
loyal audience, saying how the movie "changed people's lives." I mean no
disrespect to the Black experience in panning this movie. There are so
many other better movies and plays--*Roots*, *Queen*, *The Autobiography
of Miss Jane Pittman*, *The Piano Lesson*, etc. And there might be an even
better one out there yet to depict the legacy of slavery, but in narrative
form, as PBS's *Africans in America: America's Journey Through Slavery*
took the documentary route.</P>
