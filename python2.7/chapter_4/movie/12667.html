GODZILLA</PRE>
<P>Starring Matthew Broderick, Maria Pitillo and Jean Reno</P>
<P>Written by Dean Devlin, Terry Elliott, Rolland Emmerich and Terry Rossio</P>
<PRE>Directed by Roland Emmerich</PRE>
<P>I can probably come up with a dozen reasons why GODZILLA doesn't work. 
We could start with the script, which redefines the term "lightweight." 
Then we could move to the performances: Matthew Broderick's nutty 
professor routine never quite works, Hank Azaria thinks he's a 
recurring character on "Sesame Street," and Maria Pitillo's 
performance has the weight and texture of that powdery sugar they 
sprinkle on funnel cakes at the county fair. The special effects, while 
serviceable, in no way push the envelope. The filmmakers have even taken 
it upon themselves to not only alter Godzilla's appearance, but to 
change the whole concept of the beast from its original Japanese 
incarnation. The script even resorts to lame Siskel and Ebert jokes. I 
could go on. But despite its many flaws, I have to admit that I kind of 
dug it. The film walks a tightrope, to be sure, and very nearly plunges 
into awfulness at every turn. But you know what? If I was twelve years 
old, I would have walked away completely satisfied. When you're 
talking about a Godzilla movie, isn't that what counts?</P>
<P>Much has been written about how the original 1954 Japanese film GOJIRA, 
debuting not even ten years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, represented 
the self-inflicted punishment the Japanese felt they deserved after 
losing WWII, as well as their dreadful fear of the Atom bomb. But little 
has been said about why the films caught on in the States. To the 
millions of American boys and girls who watched Godzilla rampage through 
Tokyo on low-powered UHF stations in the 70's, Godzilla represented 
the primitive, destructive Id which our parents and school teachers 
demanded we keep in check. What kid didn't stomp on his army men in 
the backyard sandbox, fantasizing that he was 300 feet tall and able to 
do pretty much whatever the hell he wanted? Godzilla was just a big ugly 
kid throwing a temper tantrum-- and he had atomic breath to boot.</P>
<P>So INDEPENDENCE DAY creators Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, the latest 
inheritors of the Godzilla legend, had a pretty clear task before them. 
Give us a cool monster, updated for the Digital Age, have him destroy a 
major metropolitan area, give him some army men to stomp on, and come up 
with a couple of semi-interesting human characters to help us pass the 
time while we're waiting for the Big Guy to show up. Not too tough 
when you have Sony footing the bill, right?</P>
<P>The first calculated risk they take, as previously noted, is to 
completely alter the whole concept of the Lizard King. The Japanese 
version was nigh on invulnerable; he'd stand there and let the 
Japanese army take its best shot, then he'd wipe them all out with one 
blast of his atomic breath and continue on toward Tokyo. The new 
Godzilla, while equal in size, is more vulnerable and considerably more 
mobile than his predecessor. When the army starts shooting at this guy, 
he doesn't stick around' he hauls ass. Most of the destruction he 
wreaks on Manhattan is more or less a side effect of his need to outrun 
missiles and jet planes. Consequently, it takes a long time before we 
get a good look at him. We see a tail here, a foot there, but I kept 
waiting for a money shot, which never really happens. When we do get a 
good look at him, he turns out to be much more lizard-like than the old 
version. I can only compare the shock of his new look to the shock of 
comparing the new VW Beetle to the old model' not better, exactly, but 
different.</P>
<P>This Godzilla can also burrow, and ends up hiding from his human hunters 
deep in the New York City subway system. This turn of events leads us 
into a long dry stretch where we're forced to spend a lot of time with 
the sketchy human characters while they try to outwit a horde of baby 
Zillas which have hatched from eggs laid by their asexual parent in 
Madison Square Garden. The whole baby Zilla stretch is a dead rip-off of 
the Veloceraptor attack in JURASSIC PARK, only the special effects 
aren't as good. These scenes are saved, however, by the presence of 
Jean Reno, who plays a steely French secret agent who leads a team of 
commandos dispatched by the French government to kill Godzilla after 
they unwittingly created him with their nuclear tests in the Atlantic. 
As if the French would give a damn whether Manhattan gets flattened or 
not' they'd be laughing so hard that champagne would squirt out of 
their noses.</P>
<P>Broderick, as nerdy scientist Niko Testopoulos, is a game presence, but 
he really wouldn't be missed if someone else had taken the part. The 
rest of the cast is fairly anonymous, which reminds us of how much the 
success of INDEPENDENCE DAY depended on Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. 
Devlin and Emmerich reasoned, not illogically, that they could forgo 
star power, since Godzilla was the only star they needed. But then they 
limit Godzilla's screen time to a couple of extended cameos. It 
doesn't make sense, and yet it worked. There's just enough humor, 
just enough Godzilla, just enough destruction and mayhem to pull it off.</P>
<P>Even so, I couldn't fault anybody for giving this picture a 
thumbs-down. I bought it; you may not. Devlin and Emmerich are competent 
filmmakers, but their true genius lies in their ability to take a high 
concept and market the shit out of it until you feel like an utter rube 
if you don't pony up your eight dollars at the box office to take the 
ride. It's almost more fun to watch them market a film than it is to 
sit through the finished product. GODZILLA delivers, though just barely. 
The twelve-year old in me had a good time, anyway.</P>
