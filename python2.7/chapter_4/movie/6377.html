<PRE>                         THE TAMING OF THE SHREW
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     A movie as a star vehicle is an honored tradition.  So in 1967
when still fairly new director Franco Zeffirelli wanted to make his
first big Hollywood picture, he cast both Richard Burton and Elizabeth
Taylor.  The film was THE TAMING OF THE SHREW and with superstars like
that how could he miss.  The acting was sure to be good, and the press
would cover every antic on the set thus building up the excitement for
its release.</P>
<P>     The quality of the result is debatable, but one thing is certain,
Burton and Taylor clearly have great fun with their acting assignments.
The audience at the six weeks Shakespeare festival at San Jose's Camera
Three seemed to be having a good time as well.</P>
<P>     In my judgment Shakespearean comedies work best when the directors
rely on the words for the humor.  This is the path that Kenneth Branagh
chose for MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.  Zeffirelli opted instead for
slapstick figuring that the play needed to be jazzed up with many sight
gags and general physical comedy.  Moreover, although the words sound
authentic, screenwriters Suso Cecchi D'Amico, Paul Dehn, and Franco
Zeffirelli seem to have modified a fair amount of the Bard's text.  I
must admit that whenever I see the writing of a movie is done by a
committee I take that as a bad omen.</P>
<P>     The picture is filmed by Oswald Morris (Academy Award winner for
FIDDLER ON THE ROOF) and Luciano Trasatti in a hazy glow as if through
a slightly rose tinted lens.  To complement this rosy glow, the Academy
Award nominated sets by John DeCuir, Giuseppe Mariani, Lorenzo
Mongiardino, and Elven Webb look like a Disney prototype for a
RenaissanceLand.  Since Zeffirelli viewed the play as a romp, these
images help establish the spirit of the film.</P>
<P>     The music by Nino Rota (famous for his love ballet and other music
in ROMEO AND JULIET) is more substantial.  The costumes by Danilo
Donati and Irene Sharaff are fairly drab and unimaginative until the
ending ball where they finally come alive.</P>
<P>     The story is typical for Shakespeare -- full of false identities
where people are not who they seem to be.  In the play Katharina
(Elizabeth Taylor) is such a shrew that she is considered unmarriable.
The problem is that Kate has a highly attractive younger sister Bianca
(Natasha Pyne), and until Kate is wed, her father, Baptista (Michael
Hordern), will not allow Bianca to be betrothed.  Among her young
suitors is Michael York (Tybalt in ROMEO AND JULIET) in his film debut
as Lucentio.</P>
<P>     "That wench is dark mad or wonderfully forward," says Petruchio
(Richard Burton) when he first lays eyes on Kate.  Taylor spends most
of the first part of the film grunting and throwing things.  When
Petruchio hears that he will get a considerable dowry for marrying
Kate, he vows to have her.</P>
<P>     The biggest laugh in the film comes during their wedding.  After
Petruchio shows up late just to annoy Kate, she will have none of him.
When the priest asks her if she will take him for her husband, she is
about to yell out "I will NOT," but the "not" is severed when he plants
a big kiss on her lips.  This causes pandemonium to break out in the
congregation.</P>
<P>     Although by the end the slapstick does subside, we have to endure
flying tables of dust and other acts I found lacking in much real
humor.  Zeffirelli also had many filthy servants with bad teeth in his
attempt to provide increased mirth.  When he sticks to the play and to
his actor's skills, the film comes alive.  Sadly that was not as often
as it should have been.</P>
<P>     Taylor is a famous yo-yo dieter, but she was just the right size
when the movie was filmed -- certainly not svelte but trim and with an
overflowing bosom shown to advantage in the clothes of the period.
Burton too looks the part of a crude but cunning man.</P>
<P>     The last part of the play works best as Taylor and Burton get in a
humorous repartee with each other.  "'Tis the mind that makes the body
rich,"  says Petruchio (Richard Burton).  He keeps taunting her with
things he believes and things he does to see if he can trick her.</P>
<P>     The play ends with Bianca's lavish wedding feast. Petruchio
complains that it is, "nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!"</P>
<P>     For the record, my all time favorite Shakespeare movie is
Zeffirelli's ROMEO AND JULIET where he plays it straight.  In THE
TAMING OF THE SHREW he took the easier path by hamming it up.  Not a
bad movie, but there is more potential lost than realized.  I enjoyed
it enough, but I would not want to see it again.</P>
<P>     THE TAMING OF THE SHREW runs 2:02.  The show appears not to be
rated, but it would be a PG for some of the bawdy references.  There is
no sex, nudity, violence, or modern profanity.  The show would be fine
for kids of any age, but they would probably have to be at least nine
to be interested in it.  I give the show thumbs up and award it ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
