Susan Granger's review of "GO" (Columbia Pictures)</PRE>
<P> Obviously inspired by the Coen Brothers, along with Quentin
Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction," Doug Liman's "Go" is a dark, reckless
comedy/drama about some impulsive Los Angeles slackers whose lives
collide after a botched drug deal. The action takes place during a
period of 24 hours in the lives of three groups of people, and
first-time screenwriter John August's plot involves everything from a
bizarre Christmas Eve dinner to a trip to Las Vegas, with scenes of
drug deals, lap dancing, mate swapping, and tantric sex. And the story
is told from three points of view.  The ensemble cast includes Sarah
Polley ("The Sweet Hereafter") as a cool yet feisty, over-worked
supermarket clerk facing eviction; Katie Holmes (TV's "Dawson's
Creek"), who is trying to score some rent money; Jay Mohr ("Jerry
Maguire") and Scott Wolf (TV's "Party of Five"), playing soap opera
actors who get caught up in the middle of a sting operation. There are
many different characters and, somehow, during the three half-hour
segments, their wobbly paths dovetail, an obvious homage to the
strange coincidences of life.  Best known for his cult hit "Swingers"
(1996), Doug Liman also directed a low-budget comedy, "Getting In"
(1993), starring Calista Flockhart and Matthew Perry before they
landed TV roles; Jennifer Aniston was also supposed to be in that film
but the studio insisted on Kristy Swanson, who had just starred in
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer." With "Go," Limon again demonstrates his
cinematic eye for casting, as he also doubles as cinematographer,
keeping up a fast momentum. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"Go" is a nasty, vulgar, crude, off-beat 6, obviously targeted at an
18-35 year-old audience who will also appreciate the loud, ultra-hip
soundtrack. It's been dubbed "a teen 'Pulp Fiction.'"</P>
