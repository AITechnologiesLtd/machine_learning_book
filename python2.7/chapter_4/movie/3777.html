<PRE>                                  FIRST KNIGHT
                       A film review by Darrell Rudmann
                        Copyright 1995 Darrell Rudmann</PRE>
<P>     "Another King Arthur story?" I caught myself thinking, sitting in
the theatre waiting for the sneak preview to begin.  After being forced
to sit through hours of medieval films that my brother, a medieval
history freak and SCA member, made me watch through childhood, my
excitement of seeing this film was to say the least, lacking.  What
could FIRST KNIGHT add to the story of King Arthur that other stories
hadn't already done?  (And Richard Gere as Lancelot?  What the hell's
that all about?)</P>
<P>     Surprisingly, the entire film works very well (Gere does a fine
job) and adds much to existing King Arthur films.  It keeps the
sweeping scale of Excalibur, but focuses on the tight circle of the
three main characters.  Besides interesting choreography and sharp
action scenes, FIRST KNIGHT delves into the characters of Lancelot,
Lady Guenivere, and King Arthur farther than any other Camelot film
that comes to mind.  Richard Gere plays the enigmatic Lancelot, a
freelance swordfighter of sorts, who's fierce independence is tamed
only by his passionate interest for Lady Guenivere, played by Julia
Ormond.  Of course, before meeting Lancelot, she has promised her hand
in marriage to the reverent King of Camelot, Arthur, portrayed by Sean
Connery in a kind of role that he does best.  The two men clash, both
on the battlefield and off, resulting in a refreshingly intimate look
at the people behind the legend of Camelot.</P>
<P>     Unlike most action scenes nowadays, the fights were actually
entertaining and interesting to watch!  Large sets were employed to
give the viewer a true sense of being in the film--for example, a
large Round Table room was made complete with four walls, allowing for
camera shots that pan the entire room, instead of the usual "film a
corner here, film a corner there."  The film uses a number of night
shots, which are difficult to film but work wonderfully.  King Arthur's
troops, in silver armor, ambush another army in nothing but the
moonlight, in one scene.  The shiny reflections of the armor create an
unbelievable sea of twinkling light.  Also, look for the recreation of
the Gauntlet.</P>
<P>     This kind of film-making reminds me of other strong films like A
FEW GOOD MEN.  Strong acting, clean writing and directing produce a
story that is hard not to like.  I recommend this film to King Arthur
buffs and families alike.  Although not appropriate for small children,
the film is exciting and enjoyable, and does not employ foul language,
any nudity or unnecessary sexuality, nor any gore in the fighting
scenes.  Sounds impossible?  Watch it and see.  In wide release July
7th.</P>
