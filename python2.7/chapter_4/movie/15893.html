<P>This is my first review that I post to this newsgroup, and I kind of
feel like I have to say something negative about this film.  No one
else seems to care that it takes certain liberties that should not be
taken with a historical story.  However, even if one thinks of it as
fiction, "The Prince of Egypt" remains shallow.  But I'll begin from
the beginning.  The biggest difference between the original, Biblical
story and this version is that Moses has some semblance of divinity in
the Bible, whereas the animated version gives the impression of a
reluctant hero.  Maybe it's just me, but if I knew I had God on my
side, I'd have a little bit more confidence.  There are other
differences as well, such as a lack of important female characters and
the passing over of the original Pharoah's death like it's nothing but
a thing.  Most of all, though, the story's focus has shifted.  Rather
than being a story about father-son, man-ethnicity, man-God, "The
Prince of Egypt" is almost solely about the brother-brother
relationship between Rameses and Moses.  I was originally excited
about this story element until I saw the movie, where it came off as
maudlin.  Rameses and Moses squabble like children and then, in the
interests of peace, Moses saves Rameses' butt, even though Moses was
the one who started it... *yawn* I didn't care anymore by the time
Moses ran off for murdering an overseer (which, of course, never
happened in the original story - Moses was exiled).  But enough about
the differences.  Let's talk about the movie itself.  It features a
Moses who, in the interests of making the character more human, lacks
any divinity whatsoever, which isn't convincing at all to anyone who
knows who God is.  It features a cookie-cutter "I-wanna-please-dada"
Rameses, who at least is given dignity by the voicework of Ralph
Fiennes (from Schindler's List, among other things).  The film also
features an extremely annoying character by way of the "new-improved"
Miriam, voiced by the ever-antsy Sandra Bullock, even though the most
irritating thing about her is her tendency to burst into song for no
apparent reason (here Bullock is replaced by a singing voice).
Speaking of which, it contains *very* annoying music.  It contains
shallow writing.  It features extraordinary animation, which is one
good thing I can say about this film.  Most of all, it contains an
attempt to commercialize, homogenize, and mass-market a story about a
Manifestation of God.  I am not Christian, but I got the impression of
blasphemy.  The writers and producers took a butcher knife and
chop-chopped into the story.</P>
