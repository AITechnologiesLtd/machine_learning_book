<PRE>The Sixth Sense
A film review by Michael Redman
Copyright 1999 by Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>"The universe is not only stranger than you imagine, it's stranger than you
_can_ imagine."</P>
<P>That's been a favorite quote of mine for years, although I don't know who said
it. I would like to think it was Einstein or the Buddha, but in truth it was
probably Spock or Kramer. It doesn't matter where it came from, the reality of
it is apparent. We can't begin to fathom most of the answers. Rarely can we
even ask the questions.</P>
<P>True understanding of the nature of the world is beyond our science. The
occult can only be glimpsed: that's why it's called the occult. Even our own
lives are filled with invisibles that we usually choose to blind ourselves to.</P>
<P>Young eight-year-old Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osmet) can see some of those
unknowns. Everywhere he goes, the restless dead appear. Some even strike up
conversations. Understandably Cole isn't exactly comfortable with the
situation. In fact, he hides in a church and under a make-shift tent in his
bedroom, hoping to avoid the deceased.</P>
<P>Child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is dedicated to helping Cole
cope with what the doctor believes are delusions. Malcolm is also haunted, but
his spectre is the memory of a similar child he was unable to help years ago.
The opening scene of the film is that child, grown to a gaunt spooked adult,
breaking into Malcolm's apartment, blaming him for his misery.</P>
<P>Slowly, the doctor begins to believe Cole's accounts. Maybe the dead really do
want to talk to him. Why?</P>
<P>The film is difficult to talk about for a couple of reasons. The are a few
minutes that completely change the movie and are obviously the most important
scenes in the film. But to discuss them would ruin the flow of the movie for
viewers. Every single person leaving the theater is talking about those
moments. Every one.</P>
<P>I also have very mixed feelings about the movie. There's a heavy oppressive
mood that fits the storyline perfectly, but it rarely lets up. The dramatic
lighting, settings and deliberate slow pacing do exactly what they should, but
halfway through, you're looking for some relief. For some of "Sixth Sense", I
was fighting the urge to view the inside of my eyelids.</P>
<P>But then there are the few minutes that will blow you away.</P>
<P>I was left wondering if those scenes made the rest of the film worthwhile.
Yes, they do. The movie could have been better had more time been spent with
Cole's encounters with his visitors or if there were more breaks from the
melodrama, but it still works.</P>
<P>This is not a scary monster film. The ghosts aren't particularly terrifying.
But there is a point where you must challenge some of your preconceptions
about what is going on. That thought alone is unsettling. What if things
outside the movie different than you believe? What if consensus reality is
wrong? This is the scary stuff.</P>
<P>Osment is a wonder. There aren't many kid actors that could pull off the
horrified, yet resigned to his fate, character. He does it effortlessly. I
happened to catch his appearance on a talk show and was astonished to discover
that he seems to be a normal boy. He's doing real, honest-to-god acting in
this film, not just playing himself like most child actors do.</P>
<P>Willis is always fun to watch, even in the infinite remakes of "Die Hard" with
different names. There are a few films where he steps out of that persona to
become something more real. This is one of those.</P>
<P>Toni Collette as Cole's mother Lynn may be the most believable character in
the movie and offers a down to earth quality to the otherworldliness of the
film. She's a single mom, working too hard, trying to do too much. Lost in her
endless tasks, she feel helpless to deal with her son's retreat from life.</P>
<P>If you are going to see this film, don't let anyone tell you about it. Don't
read any more reviews. Don't ask about those few minutes. There are any number
of things in life that need to be experienced and for which words are
inadequate. This is one of them.</P>
