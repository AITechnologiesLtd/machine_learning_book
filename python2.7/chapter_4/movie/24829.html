<PRE>Shanghai Noon 
A film review by Marty Mapes 
Copyright 2000 Marty Mapes </PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4) I love Jackie Chan movies. Even if the plot is
confusing or the characters are flat, I love them anyway because Chan's
amazing stunts and graceful moves are a joy to watch. Unfortunately,
SHANGHAI NOON has no amazing stunts, and although there are some fight
sequences, they are more edited and less performed than I've come to
expect from Chan. The movie isn't completely unlikeable, but it's not
for Chan connoisseurs.</P>
<PRE>Ancient Chinese Plot Device</PRE>
<P>The movie opens in China on one of the oldest and most-used plot devices
in the world: the Princess has been kidnapped. Naturally, Jackie Chan
(playing Chon Wang) is sent to the Western U.S. territories to find her
and bring her back.</P>
<P>The movie introduces us to Roy (Owen Wilson) and his band of comically
inept outlaws. Roy and his gang are robbing the passengers of a train --
the same train that Chon and the rest of the royal entourage is on. One
of Roy's men shoots one of the "Chinamen," Chon's uncle, which gives the
movie an excuse for a fight scene.</P>
<PRE>The First Stunt</PRE>
<P>It had been about 15 minutes without any Jackie Chan stunts -- not even
any little easy ones. So when someone disconnected the last car on the
train, with Jackie on one side and the bad guys on the other, I knew I
was about to witness the first stunt. I was on the edge of my seat,
ready to be amazed and thrilled. Jackie backed up into the car to get a
running start, dashed toward the end of the car, and ...</P>
<P>And the editor cut to a blurry medium shot of a figure that MIGHT HAVE
been Chan, jumping between two train cars that MIGHT HAVE been moving at
different speeds. If Chan really did do the stunt, then the director and
the editor are idiots for obscuring it. But I'm sure that's not the
case.</P>
<PRE>The Second Stunt</PRE>
<P>The fight continues up the train as Chon takes on Roy's gang, one by
one. Finally, Chon finds himself on a stack of timbers piled on a
flatbed car. Gun in hand, Roy follows him onto the logs, and the two
stare each other down. One of Roy's henchmen appears, standing next to a
release lever at the end of the car. He growls "I know how to get him
offa there."</P>
<P>Again I saw the stunt coming. I was on the edge of my seat, ready to be
amazed and thrilled. Jackie stands on the logs with a look of shock on
his face. The henchman pulls the lever to release the logs, and...</P>
<P>And the editor cuts to a helicopter shot of two figures that MIGHT have
been real people (if they weren't computer-generated), harmlessly
flailing their limbs over a pile of rolling and tumbling logs.   Clang!
Ooof!</P>
<P>SHANGHAI NOON's fight scenes have the choreography and pace of Chan's
other movies. But still, I think they rely more heavily on editing and
less on performance than in previous Chan movies. The most obvious
example is when Chon makes a weapon from a rope and a horseshoe. It
LOOKS like the weapon was too hard to use because there's never a clear
shot of the thing working. But add a few sound effects and turn up the
volume (Whoosh-whoosh-whoosh! Clang! Ooof!), and you can get away with
visually sloppy fight scenes.</P>
<PRE>---------------------------
"These guns are really weird."
-- Owen Wilson as Roy
---------------------------</PRE>
<P>The movie does have some things going for it. Wilson is appealing as the
bandit who can't shoot straight and who doesn't have the heart to be
ruthless. Some of the movie's funniest lines, ad-libbed by Wilson, come
from the softspoken, yet sarcastic Roy.</P>
<P>Also, the camaraderie between Roy and Chon (after their first encounter,
they forgive and forget) was funny and warm. It's the same friendship
that Chris Tucker and Chan showed in RUSH HOUR, which makes me think
Chan is really as nice a guy as he seems.</P>
<P>Plus, it's just hard not to like Jackie Chan, especially when he's doing
fight scenes that have been choreographed just for him. At one point he
fends off two drunken cowboys wielding only moose antlers.</P>
<PRE>Unfortunately, the filmmakers underused Chan's talents. His role could
have been played by anyone. I didn't go to see SHANGHAI NOON the comedy.
I went to see SHANGHAI NOON the Jackie Chan movie, and I was
disappointed.
