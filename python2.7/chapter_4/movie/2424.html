<PRE>                                 REALITY BITES
                       A film review by Vijay Ramanujan
                        Copyright 1994 Vijay Ramanujan</PRE>
<P>Cast: Winona Ryder (Lelaina); Janeane Garofalo (Vickie); Ethan Hawke
      (Troy); Ben Stiller (Mike).</P>
<P>     This movie can really be broken down into two parts.  The first
half was an humorous, intelligent story of one woman's job and man
troubles shortly after graduation.  The second half was a depressingly
realistic look at what makes these people tick.  I found myself
wondering whether my generation is really as f-ed up as we appear in
this movie.</P>
<P>     The first half tells the story, not only of Lelaina, but of the
people she lives with and the people she hangs out with.  There is her
roommate, and soon to be GAP manager, Vickie, who has slept with
sixty-six men, whose names she can't all remember.  But she does have
an knack for killer one-liners.  There is their gay "permanent
resident" who is an underwritten character.  He doesn't do much except
set up Vickie's jokes.  And then there is the obnoxious temporary
roommate, Troy, who does nothing but hang around the house and insult
everyone around him.  But he saves his meanest for Lelaina, and by that
we are supposed to conclude that he loves her.</P>
<P>     Before the "cliche" police come out in full force, it should be
said that this breaks the standard lines in more way than one.  First
of all, these two aren't enemies.  They have even slept together once,
although Lelaina claims she was drunk at the time.  Second, they
establish very early that they are attracted to each other.  The
question is not whether they are willing to admit it, as is normal, but
more of whether she can do better than him.</P>
<P>     Now, without going into detail, the second half of the movie was
almost too realistic.  It shows a group of people who have no sense of
direction, living one dimensional lives, if that.  They are not
searching for salvation, they are merely trying to survive.  There is
no feeling that the conclusion is final, or that the characters will be
happy for ever after.</P>
<P>     This movie does invite criticism, some warranted and some not.
First, the warranted.  It does seem unrealistic that a class
valedictorian would have difficulty with addition (as Lelaina
does--costing her a job opportunity) or would be unable to define
irony.  The movie would have been better had they let Lelaina be a
good, but not great student.  And the unwarranted intrusion of rich
parents really sapped some of her futility.  She should have been drawn
more generically.</P>
<P>     The unfair criticism, as I see it, is this.  There is the usual
backlash against happy endings, and complaints that Lelaina chooses the
wrong man.  It seems to me that the two complaints are contradictory.
As for the second, it is a double standard, that we want reality, but
we also want her to be happy.  Sometimes people do pick the wrong
partner.  Her decision is predictable because it is in keeping with her
character.  The other criticism, that the movie failed to be fresh
after a while, while true, is not as much a criticism as a comment of
the flow of the movie.  There were two jobless characters, one who
thought she was dying of AIDS and one who was kicked out of his house.
Fresh might have been the wrong mood for the movie to take.</P>
<PRE>So, overall
3.5*/4
(An eye opener for anyone who thought John Hughes was realistic)</PRE>
