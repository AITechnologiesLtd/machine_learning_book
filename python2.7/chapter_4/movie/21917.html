<PRE>The Legend of 1900 (1999)</PRE>
<P> "The world on land -- it's just too big for me."</P>
<P>Starring Tim Roth, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Bill Nunn, Clarence Williams
III. Rated R.</P>
<P>The Legend of 1900s is the year's most absurd movie, a rambling,
nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast. It stars
thespian extraordinaire Tim Roth, looking wistful as ever, as a guy
named... 1900. You heard right. His name is, in all actuality, 1900. He
was born on an ocean liner on 1/1/1900 (uh, hence the name), abandoned
and adopted by Danny, a ship crewman. 1900 spends most of his early
years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of Danny's fear that he
might be taken away from him because of "visa matters."</P>
<P>Well, when 1900 is about 9 or so, he starts wondering all around the
ship. One day, he discovers a grand piano. He sits down and starts
playing. Miraculously, what comes out is beautiful. A group of
onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing
music at such a young age. When one of the people who knows 1900 tells
him that his playing the piano like that without permission is "totally
against regulations" 1900 replies "F*ck the regulations!" Ho ho ho.</P>
<P>1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land. When he's about 30ish and
can play the piano like nobody's business, onboard comes another
musician. His name is Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince) and he plays the
trumpet. After 1900 catches Max barfing everywhere during a storm, he
sits him down on the piano next to him, takes the piano's braces off
and plays while the piano flies all around the hall, taking them with
it. How the chair they're sitting on and the piano don't separate, I
don't know, but this apparently isn't the kind of thing we're supposed
to ask.</P>
<P>After that, 1900 and Max become friends. Max is determined to get 1900
off the ship and discover what he is missing on land, but 1900 has no
intention of doing so. What's more, he doesn't even want his music to
go anywhere without him: when a record company hears about his talents,
they come on board to make a record of his music, but after finding out
that -- gasp! -- they're going to make millions of copies, he breaks
the record.</P>
<P>The conflict of the movie is that after Max, unsuccessful in his
endeavor to get 1900 off the ship, gets off himself, he stumbles upon a
record of 1900's music in a store. The record shouldn't exist because
a) 1900 never stepped on dry land and b) the one record that was made
on the ship was broken. Ladies and gentlemen, it's a mystery!</P>
<P>The story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its
elements. We're supposed to be roused by a climactic... piano duel?
There isn't anything in this movie with the potential to compel. 1900
comes off as a whiny, brooding, extremely unlikable man: I can't recall
a single word he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo-
meditation on life. Ditto for Max, who doesn't seem to have a life
outside his friendship with 1900.</P>
<P>Tim Roth plays 1900 with about as much panache as a fig leaf; there's
no spirit, no gusto to the character. He insists that he leads a happy
life on the ship, but to us he is dead. Pruitt Taylor Vince is a little
more palatable, at least providing a moment of comic relief here and
there to liven things up a bit. The highlight of the movie would have
to be the eminently amusing Clarence Williams the III as the arrogant,
leering "King of Jazz" who challenges 1900 to the aforementioned piano
duel.</P>
<P>The Legend of 1900 was made by Giuseppe Tornatore, whose 1988 Cinema
Paradiso is considered a masterpiece by many. This effort is utterly
limp and lifeless. At once ridiculous, boring, narrow-sighted and
pointless, this is one movie that should be -- and will be -- quickly
forgotten.</P>
