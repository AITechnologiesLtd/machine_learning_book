<PRE>FIVE CORNERS
*** OF **** grade is B-</PRE>
<P>Five Corners is a good film that you may have missed in its theatrical
run and on the video shelves, but it is well worth a look.  It is a
period piece for 1964 and doesn't rely on old pop hits for its impact. 
Instead we get serious melodrama with sprinkles of violence and good
acting.  It has a great cast: Jodie Foster, Tim Robbins and John
Turturro.  </P>
<P>The plot deals with many characters and plot strands that basically
consist of two separate stories.  The one with headliner actors works
very well, the other doesn't seem complete.  The two stories will
eventually tie together (unconvincingly) and wrap up with a violent
conclusion.  We have a psychopathic rapist Heinz (John Turturro)
released from prison, much to the alarm of Linda (Jodie Foster) who was
almost raped by him. Harry (Tim Robbins) who has sworn off violence
since his father died yet saved Linda from Heinz.  Jamie (Todd Graff)
who is afraid of Heinz and was injured by him.  Unconvincing scenes of
two guys and two girls interrupt this convincing segment.  The girls
(drugged up beauties) were given to the guys (a couple of street punks)
along wit five dollars by one of the girl's fiancé.  The girls wake up
with headaches and no clothes in a strange environment, one of the boy's
pseudo apartment.</P>
<P>The violence is very deftly used in the film, it underlines the scenes
of joy and adjustment to the times.  There is a shadow over every scene
and a hauntingly, sometimes cheerful, score in the background.  The
three actors who are now stars are really very good, but for me the
standout is Todd Graff as the jealous former boyfriend of Linda.  It is
a small performance but an important one for the impact of the film, and
somewhat touching.  He is not as tough as anyone else on the screen but
he is sweet and infectious and has high energy.  In one scene he is
offered a cup of coffee, while he storms around the room, he comments
that he can't because his heart might explode.  I liked that scene and
many others in the film.</P>
<P>Yet this film has many problems, too many characters, a setup to the
climax, and that second story.  It just simple doesn't belong in this
film, it's like throwing Now & Then into Goodfellas because they have a
similar time period.  Even with those flaws I can recommend this movie,
the problems it have stop it form being great but we are left with a
satisfying movie experience.</P>
