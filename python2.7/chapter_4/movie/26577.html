<PRE>ROCK 'N' ROLL FRANKENSTEIN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>ROCK 'N' ROLL FRANKENSTEIN's writer and director Brian O'Hara deserves 
credit for his unflinchingly audacious approach to satire.  Making the 
Farrelly brothers (ME, MYSELF & IRENE) look like a couple of choir boys 
in comparison, O'Hara purposely makes a film that attempts to be good by 
being very, very bad.  It's a tough way to make a buck, but at least 
he's honest and doesn't pull any of his punches.  But a film this 
scatological, sacrilegious and down-right gross will not be something 
that many filmgoers will be able to stomach.  Some of its "best" scenes 
shock your system so that you don't know whether to regurgitate or 
laugh.</P>
<P>A low budget horror film, it pokes fun at its own poverty through use of 
excessively cheesy props -- think of it as an Ed Wood and young John 
Waters collaboration.  In a film with no limits, ripping opening a 
victim's stomach isn't anywhere near the movie's worst image.  The 
unlucky character doesn't even get a name in the script.  The credits 
list her simply as Gutted Groupie.</P>
<P>Now for those of you that are still with me, we'll talk some about the 
story itself, which is rather clever.  Record producer Bernie Stein 
(Barry Feterman) has had it with arrogant rock stars, who abandon him 
when they hit the big time, so he has arranged for his nephew, Frankie 
Stein (Jayson Spence), to build him a rocker out of spare parts, but not 
just any parts.  Uncle Bernie wants a rocker composed of parts of the 
great rock 'n' rollers of history from Elvis on down, literally.  Since 
the head comes from Elvis's grave, the monster (Graig Guggenheim) sounds 
like and is known as the King.</P>
<P>Everyone in the story is pretty weird.  Frankie likes to curl up in bed 
with the Coroner's Quarterly as his equivalent of Playboy.  A spaced-out 
druggie named Iggy (Hiram Jacob Segarra) and his fellow dudes are 
contracted by Bernie to rob the graves.  Iggy's fried brain contains a 
simple philosophy ("A mind is a terrible thing not to get wasted.")  
Soon newspaper headlines read "Dead Rockers' Graves Are Being 
Desecrated."</P>
<P>The result of the big operation isn't exactly what the great doctor -- 
actually a fired coroner -- expects.  With all of the energy of a 
department store mannequin, King's future doesn't initially look bright.  
But with a few injections he finds his voice, and he and his band, 
Unnatural Urges, hit the big time.  Some parts of King's body prove more 
successful than others, which allows the movie to sink to new lows in 
the pursuit of its gross brand of humor.</P>
<P>Given the antics of some of our more infamous rock stars, this film may 
make you think twice about their origins, but the movie does not appear 
to be based on a true story.  One thing about the film is certain.  It 
is liable to dichotomize the audiences into those who walk out in 
disgust in the first few minutes and those who manage to find its 
irreverent and sick brand of humor funny.  If there ever was a movie 
that would best be seen only in the wee hours, this is it.  Locally, it 
will be showing as a midnight madness movie -- just the right time.</P>
<P>ROCK 'N' ROLL FRANKENSTEIN runs a long 1:28.  It is not rated but would 
probably be NC-17 for graphic violence, strong gore, explicit sex, 
nudity, language, drug usage and probably a bunch of other offensive 
stuff which I've already forgotten.  It would not be acceptable for 
anyone under 18.   </P>
