<P>     Should you see this movie?  Probably not--not unless you're under
the age of ten.  Based on the (de)merits of story mechanics alone, THE
SANTA CLAUSE should be unwatchable.  The trouble is the star.  Tim
Allen, of TV's "Home Improvement," has leaped to the big screen with
his talent intact.  He's witty, he's charming and, thanks to a
*fantastic* make-up job, he's the life-presever for a movie that should
sink.  Plot holes can't swallow him, sentiment can't drown him; the
comic even gets away with a decade-old ZZ Top gag.</P>
<P>     The other cast members should be so lucky.  Two child actors are
good--Eric Lloyd and David Krumholtz--but the rest of the rest are
bargain-basement at best.  What can you say about a film where neither
Judge Reinhold nor Peter Boyle are funny?</P>
<P>     THE SANTA CLAUSE looks like a made-for-TV movie and that's no
good.  With the exception of Allen's exceptional make-up, the special
effects consist almost entirely of blue screens and flying wires.  Both
of which can be tolerated, but avert thine eyes at the cheesy arctic
soundstage.  Shudder.</P>
<P>     The story is sanitized--thank you, Mr. Disney--so most of the gags
are of the warm, fuzzy variety.  The tone is tame, but a divorce
subplot a la MRS. DOUBTFIRE provides a slight reality check.  What's
really needed, though, is a narrative device to help chart the passage
of time.</P>
<P>     THE SANTA CLAUSE chronicles one year in the life of Scott Calvin
(Allen), a busy businessman who just happens to be the big guy.  Over
the year his weight increases, his hair turns grey, and he develops a
taste for cookies and milk.  Because there's no framing device to count
down to the big day, the entire midsection sags.  Does dad gain all his
weight in one week?  Does his beard appear in July?  Sigh.</P>
<P>     The film wraps with a super-silly finale that should've been left
on the cutting room floor.  Who wants to see Santa and a SWAT team in
the same frame?  Oh, what John Hughes could've done here.</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:    Sappy, sloppy Santa story that's strictly kids fare.
                Even Allen fans may get bored.  Ho ho HO!</PRE>
