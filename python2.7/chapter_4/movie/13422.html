<PRE>MADELINE
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>This adaptation of Ludwig Bemelmans' classic children's book, Madeline,
is mostly faithful to the original.  Unfortunately, the alterations are
the film's weakest link.</P>
<P>Hatty Jones stars as the title character, an orphaned girl adopted by
the church, and attending a girl's school in Paris.  The headmistress is
the kindly Miss Clavel (Frances McDormand), who has a sixth sense when
something isn't quite right.</P>
<P>And something often isn't right, whether the independent-minded Madeline
is getting into some sort of trouble, or the school's chief benefactor
(Stephanie Audran) is on her deathbed and her cruel husband, Lord
Covington (Nigel Hawthorne) plots to sell the house.</P>
<P>At times, the film threatens to devolve into Home Alonesque nonsense.
But, luckily, the film stays above that level and comes up with more
creative ways to solve its dilemmas.</P>
<P>Nearly all the familiar scenes from the book are stuffed in the movie at
one point or another.  For only being 90 minutes long, the filmmakers
did a good job of putting everything in, without the end result feeling
overstuffed.</P>
<P>Performances throughout are pleasant, but no one really stands out from
the work.  Hatty Jones is neither annoying nor endearing in the title
role.</P>
<P>Those expecting a thrill ride of a movie are apt to be disappointed by
this comparatavely bland film.  Still, Madeline offers a nice
alternative to the standard summer fare.</P>
<P>Fans of the book will be adequately pleased by this interpretation.
However, besides being a nice movie, the film has little to offer those
toward the book series.</P>
