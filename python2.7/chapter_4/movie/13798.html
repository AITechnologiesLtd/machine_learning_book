<P>Plot: A singer's search for her missing sister leads her to a pier 
freakshow run by the wheelchair-ridden Dr Durea. But Dr Durea is really 
a descendant of the Frankenstein family and is injecting his dim-witted 
assistant with a serum to turn him into a monster to collect victims for 
his experiments in revivification of the decapitated. And at the same 
time Durea is coerced by Count Dracula into helping him revive the 
original Frankenstein monster.</P>
<P>It's one of the great title confrontations of all time, one that 
Universal in their various monster team-ups of the 1940s (`Frankenstein 
Meets the Wolfman' (1943), `House of Frankenstein' (1944), `House of 
Dracula' (1945) and `Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein' (1948)) 
somehow overlooked. And it was a popular idea too - there were at least 
two other films using the same title conflict that appeared the same 
year as this. But in terms of delivering on its title challenge, this is 
a thoroughly wasted opportunity. It's not just what an incredibly 
shabbily made film it is - it's that Dracula and Frankenstein seem 
irrelevant to the plot which is really about a girl searching for her 
missing sister who has been abducted into a mad scientist's ill-defined 
scheme that has something to do with decapitating and then reviving 
young women from the dead. Dracula and the Frankenstein monster do have 
a tussle at the climax to justify the title but it is poorly motivated 
confrontation.</P>
<P>The rest of the film is a mess. It is badly directed and the plot is a 
haphazard jumble (not surprising considering that it originally started 
out as a biker film and was turned into a monster bash to capitalize on 
the early 1970s classic monster revival). It is sad to watch genre 
veterans like an ageing and wheelchair-ridden J. Carrol Naish and an 
alcoholically wasted Lon Chaney Jr (in his last performance) reduced to 
playing in such impoverished surroundings. Forrest J. Ackerman is 
credited as technical advisor and has a small part as a doctor victim, 
something which demonstrates he should really stick to editing. Zandor 
Vorkov gives a performance that verges on the somnambulistic, making 
what is possibly the worst screen Dracula of all time.</P>
<P>Screening at the Christchurch 1998 Incredibly Strange Film Festival
