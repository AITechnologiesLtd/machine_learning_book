<P>Susan Granger's review of "MANSFIELD PARK" (Miramax Films)</P>
<P>In this provocative, revisionist adaptation of Jane Austen's
third novel, Canadian writer-director Patricia Rozema gives her 19th
century heroine, Fanny Price, much of Austen's own confidant, creative
personality.  Incorporating material from Austen's early journals and
letters, Rozema recreates Fanny (Frances O'Connor) as a poor relation
who is sent from Portsmouth to the magnificent mansion called
Mansfield Park to live in emotional exile with her pompous uncle,
starchy aunts, and privileged cousins. Her favorite cousin is the
brooding Edmund (Jonny Lee Miller) who is destined to be a humble
clergyman, much to the chagrin of the outspoken, ambitious young woman
(Embeth Davidtz) who wants to marry him. Always made to feel inferior
within the genteel, rigidly conventional British class system, she is
considered more than a servant but less than an equal
companion. Nevertheless, meek Fanny becomes an adept and witty writer
who is courted by a charming, handsome rake (Allesandro Nivola) whom
she does not trust. Australian actress Frances O'Connor does a
splendid job as the plucky heroine and her complex performance is
matched by playwright Harold Pinter, as her autocratic uncle, and
Lindsay Duncan in dual roles - as both Fanny's desperate, impoverished
mother and wealthy, opium-addicted aunt. Admittedly, Patricia Rozema's
script tackles too many social issues, including the dark brutality of
slavery on the Caribbean island of Antigua, an exploitive endeavor
which supports this segment of England's landed gentry. And Rozema's
willfully manipulative, pro-feminist characters seem far ahead of
their time. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, Mansfield Park is a
sensual, cinematic 7.  It's a period drama that should appeal,
primarily, to the art-house crowd.</P>
