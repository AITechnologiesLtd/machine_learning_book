Not Rated, 94 minutes</PRE>
<P>Young love, it's a subject drenched with nostalgia and sentimentality, but 
what about old love? Can a relationship flourish if its participants are 73? 
Yes, and no</P>
<P>It has been nearly fifty years since Andreas (Tingwell) and Claire (Blake) 
had their love affair in post-war Belgium. Since then, Claire has married 
John (Norris), and Andreas's spouse has passed on. Andreas, still feeling 
what he believes is love, writes a letter to Claire after the half century 
they spent apart. He wants to see her again, and while she is reluctant at 
first, she too cannot deny the passion that lingers between her and Andreas. 
Claire's marriage to John, of course, complicates matters. </P>
<P>While Innocence has played the festival circuit as a quietly affecting drama, 
it is actually a long-drawn-out, slow comedic tragedy that is always in 
danger of falling apart. The film teeters at its beginning, where Andreas, 
for seemingly no particular reason, writes a letter to his old love. This 
happens over the opening credits, accompanied by images of the couple in 
their early years. Everything was the way it should be back then. Director 
Paul Cox chooses to intercut random shots of the young Andreas and Claire 
together throughout the film. This happens until he eventually gave me the 
feeling that these people were trying to relive their teenage years, rather 
than share a contemporary, yet old-fashioned relationship. Claire remarks at 
least five times, "Don't act that way. It's like I'm seventeen again." All 
three main characters over-analyze their situations to obscene standards, and 
use lots of big words. It is, indeed, like watching an episode of Dawson's 
Creek with much, much older actors. More unnecessary scenes and dialogue pile 
up as it goes on. This should have been much tighter.</P>
<P>Cox should be thankful for his actors. They save the entire movie and nearly 
make the whole thing believable and enjoyable. Charles Tingwell, Julia Blake, 
and Terry Norris all give excellent performances. There is a sense of truth 
in their work that evades the rest of the picture. Innocence is, like The 
Straight Story, a reminder that there are many aged actors overflowing with 
talent that aren't getting any work in Hollywood today. Congratulations are 
also in order for Tony Clark, the film's cinematographer. </P>
<P>Age might play a big factor in whether or not you enjoy Innocence. The film 
will certainly appeal to an older demographic, who will probably appreciate 
it more than I did. Innocence doesn't lose all innocence completely, but 
there wasn't enough here for me.</P>
