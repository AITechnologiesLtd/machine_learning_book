<P>     Sexual harassment is the subject of DISCLOSURE, a broadly played
thriller that may do more to goose the career of the director than to
educate the masses on the subject matter.</P>
<P>     Meet Tom Sanders (Michael Douglas), a stable family man at the
Seattle computer firm Digicom.  He loves his wife, he loves his job,
and he's expecting a promotion before the big company merger.  What he
gets, instead, is a new boss who's an old girlfriend (Demi Moore).  The
situation quickly comes to a head following an after-hours
tete-a-tete.  Tom refuses her advance, she files for harassment, and
thus begins the plot.</P>
<P>     What sounds like a neat twist on a stereotypical situation really
isn't; writer Paul Attansio (of QUIZ SHOW fame) has simply swapped
genders.  Big deal.  Like the book, the film has bigger fish to fry.
DISCLOSURE is more than just a story of sexual harassment and that's
all I'll reveal here.</P>
<P>     For sheer people-pleasing power, rank DISCLOSURE alongside
Crichton's other novel-to-film, JURASSIC PARK.  The script is smart,
the direction is tidy, and the cast knows their roles by heart.
Michael Douglas makes a solid, sturdy hero, while Demi Moore is
surprisingly effective as the hissable villain.  Her calm dismissal of
Douglas made at least one patron in *my* row talk back to the screen.</P>
<P>     There are many many more reasons to like this film, but my
favorite has to be the way DISCLOSURE depicts a high-tech computer
firm.  Come on, Dennis Miller as a developer?!?  They get some stuff
right, but watch out for those VR sequences!  Did somebody say
LAWNMOWER MAN?</P>
<P>NOTE:   Gripes to the management of Durham's Wynnsong 10, who delayed
        the film by fifteen minutes to help seat stragglers.  The film
        was also out of focus when started and the management didn't
        correct the error for at least five minutes.  Sigh.</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:    Broadly played thriller that excites more than it
                educates.  It'll make millions.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: B+</PRE>
