<PRE>                              THE PATRIOT
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>A note to filmmakers who want to make a movie about a war:  Please
understand that your film does not need to be as long as the actual war
itself.  We will not hold it against you if it's shorter.  As such, I
will try to keep this review to a length where you can read it in a few
minutes.</P>
<P>The Patriot gives Mel Gibson the opportunity to do something he's never
done before:  To orate at length about the evils of taxation without
representation... oh, okay... and to kill a bunch of damn redcoats!!!</P>
<P>Faced with the death of his wife, The Patriot offers us Gibson the
widower pacifist, playing the part of South Carolina colonialist
Benjamin Martin, unswayed by arguments that war should be initiated
against Britain.  When his son Gabriel (Heath Ledger) enlists despite
his father's forbiddance, Martin is left at home to raise his other six
kids while the war rages around him.</P>
<P>Circumstances arise to take the life of one of the children at the hands
of the uber-evil redcoat Colonel Tavington (Jason Isaacs), which awakens
the repressed blood lust in the former soldier Martin.  Perhaps one of
the best battle scenes ever filmed follows, with Martin and two of his
kids picking off 20 redcoats in the forest, leaving Martin covered in
gore.</P>
<P>The Patriot soon becomes the epic it was intended to be, with grand
colonial battles fought by lines of soldiers politely shooting at one
another until one side is dead.  But Martin (an amalgam of several real
Revolutionaries) brings dirty guerilla tactics to the war, and after
forming a militia of scrappy mercenaries, soon he's got General
Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson) running scared.</P>
<P>While The Patriot will draw obvious comparisons to Braveheart, it is
actually far more reminiscent of Kevin Costner's Robin Hood sprinkled
with a bit of The Last of the Mohicans.  Martin lives in the woods and
attacks the Brits in small groups, absconding with their booty.  There's
even a holy man (Rene Auberjonois) and a foreigner (Tchéky Karyo, in a
great supporting turn as a French sympathizer) who fight alongside the
rebels.</P>
<P>This turns out to be a good thing, because God knows we don't need
another Braveheart.  The Patriot also turns out to be a message movie,
filled with issues regarding honor vs. survival, vengeance vs.
forgiveness, negotiation vs. war, and glory vs. sacrifice.  This isn't
just some ordinary war movie.  It's deep, with John Williams' score
driving the heart-tugging home and Roland Emmerich's direction not
getting in the way.  And I say all that in a rare moment of non-sarcasm.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, at close to three hours in length, The Patriot has plenty
of time to get hokey.  The bad guy is drawn as broadly as a Bond
villain, and a gaggle of subplots don't add much to the film, just
making it unnecessarily longer.  The anti-slavery motif is especially
hokey and unneeded.</P>
<P>But, as usual, I quibble.  The Patriot, against all expectations, is
probably the best movie I've seen this summer to date.  And where else
can a German director and an Australian star put together a movie about
the Revolutionary War.  Ah, only in America.</P>
