<PRE>WARGAMES
United States 1983
Directed by John Badham</PRE>
<P>Cast: Matthew Broderick [David], Ally Sheedy [Jennifer],
Barry Corbin [Gen. Beringer], John Wood [Stephen Falken]</P>
<PRE>Rating: 4 out of 5</PRE>
<P>It's a fact that a good thriller or
action movie doesn't need violence to
be good or worth watching. All it takes
is potential violence to make the
audience bite their nails. And what
kind of violence could be more efficient
than a global thermo-nuclear war?</P>
<P>And potential violence is the premiss WarGames
is built upon. A computer whiz-kid, David,
is usually contended with hacking into
the school computer to change his grades.
But after having read an advertisment
for an upcoming computer game, he wants to
be the first to play it. Instead of
getting into the computer at Protovision
Software he accidentally comes to the frontgate
of NORAD. With the help of Jennifer, a girl
in his biology class, he starts to play a
nice game of nuclear war with WOPR, War Operation
Plan Response (a top-notch computer at the time,
but now hardly faster than my own computer)</P>
<P>I remember being 12 and watching this
at the cinema. It was very efficent at giving
you a scare in those days and that hasn't
changed. Of course, a nuclear war seemed to
be much more of something that could actually
happen back in 1983. I wouldn't be surprised
if this gave people nightmares. I hope it still
does since you still hear about school kids
hacking into the computers at Pentagon.</P>
<P>Broderick and Sheedy are just fine as the
young teenagers (although her interest in David
remains a mystery). But the rest of the actors are,
by no fault of their own, restricted by the script
to play one-dimensional grownups. David's parents
are the same kind of parents that populate all
these college comedies from the 1980s, movies like
Secret Admirer, Porky's or Zapped and the NORAD general
Beringer is straight out of Dr. Strangelove.</P>
<P>If for no other reason, you should see this movie to enjoy
how far the computer technology has gone since those days.
David uses the same telephone for calling friends as calling
other computers. The modem is some kind of device that
he puts the headset on. Far from any 56K modem my guess
is that it's some kind of 2400 bps modem, the kind of
technology you now find at your local technical museum. The
big computer at NORAD has a lot of flashing lights (just like
those you see on Star Trek or any old sf-movie) but it's
hardly impressing compared with what you can get today.</P>
<P>What are the lessons we can learn from WarGames?
1. Make sure there are no secret backdoors into
military computers.
2. Thank you, whoever it was, for giving us
a graphical user interface when we use our computers!</P>
