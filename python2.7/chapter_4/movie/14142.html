<P>   When Joseph Smith urged Mormon men to take many
wives, he did so because he believed in rescuing bodies in
limbo waiting to be born.  But bigamy is a no-no, contrary to
the laws of the fifty United States, a prohibition which gives a
platform to Gregory Nava's movie "Why Do Fools Fall in
Love."  "Fools" is a movie with lots of pizazz, edgy
performances, and many humorous turns focusing on a court
case involving a young man who took three wives, each of
whom was in the dark about her real status.  Nava, suiting
Tina Andrews's script to the wide screen, sorts the movie into
two area: one, the stories told in court by the three women
about their relationship with the man of their dreams; the
other, the uneven career of teenage sensation Frankie
Lymon, who made a smash debut at the age of thirteen with
his de-wop hit, "Why Do Fools Falls in Love."  We come away
from the movie more fully understanding why so many
celebrities have taken to drink and drugs--not so much
because they're available and affordable with their high
salaries and royalities, but more because they cannot endure
the tedium off the stage, away from the enormous high they
get from the hysterical cheers of their rabid fans.  In Frankie
Lymon's case, his death from a heroin overdose at the age of
twenty-five was brought on by a more permanent recess from
the showbiz platforms: when his do-wop style of singing went
out of fashion, buried by the Beatles, by the Motown sound,
and by the unique style of Jimi Hendrix, his career was over. 
Watching others make good while he was out pounding the
streets and scorned by his producer, he fell into a funk that
could be alleviated only by heroin.  We identify with him not
because we are dopeheads or because we've had
spectacular careers pleasing the teeming crowds.  But we
know how it feels to be out of favor, out of a job, disregarded
by those who mean something to us.</P>
<P>   When photographer Ed Lachman shifts in the final scene to
a black-and-white cut of the actual Frankie Lymon performing
the title song at the age of thirteen, the singer seems even
smaller and younger than we expect. Given the rudimentary
camerawork at the time and the absence of knock-'em-dead
sound systems, he looks like nothing special.  Larenz Tate, a
handsome actor who has turned in spellbinding performances
in movies like "Menace II Society" and "Dead Presidents" 
makes the '50's singer larger than life, one whose appeal to
women of all races is perfectly understandable.  Lip-synching
to "Fools" and especially to Johnny Mercer and Matt
Malneck's wonderful song "Goody Goody," Tate chews up the
scenery in the generous number of clips featuring his
appearances before screaming, hand-clapping crowds of most
young whites.  In one such performance for live TV, a blond
teenaged girl leaps to the stage and begins jitterbugging with
the singer.  While it's difficult for us in the '90's to believe, the
show was cancelled because Lymon was "dancing with a
white girl."  The electricity in the air is so palpable each time
Tate takes on the role of Lymon on the concert stage that we
wonder how do-wop could ever have gone out of fashion.</P>
<P>   The principal action, however, takes place in the courtroom
of Judge Lambrey (Pamela Reed), who is hearing a case
brought against Lymon's estate by the three women who
claimed they were his wives.  The women are so different
from one another that while we have no doubt that all were
captivated by the charismatic singer, we wonder how they all
appealed equally to Lymon.  Zola (Halle Berry) seemed his
obvious choice.  A successful performer with the Platters, she
is all showbiz glamour with obvious common ground with her
husband.  Elizabeth (Vivica F. Fox), however, seems cheap, a
petty thief who spent time in jail for shoplifting stupid items
like perfume, but one who is willing to sell her body on the
streets to raise money for her beloved.  Emira (Lela Rochon)
is taken in by the man's charm like the others, but what would
Lymon want with a high-school English teacher, a prissy one
at that? </P>
<P>  As the women tell their stories in turn, trying to convince the
court that each has the primary claim on the estate. they take
us through Frankie's brief career, though (unfortunately for the
clarity of the story) not in chronological order. He begins his
calling with a group that take on the name the Teenagers and
becomes its head.  They wholly impress a record producer,
Morris Levy (Paul Mazursky), who signs them up but, as we
learn toward the very end of the story, rips them off by
grabbing for himself an unfair share of the royalties (he is
actually listed along with Lymon as the writer of the title
song).  When the number of gigs goes down to zero because
of changing styles, Frankie becomes desperate, shoots drugs
and gets into trouble with the pushers whom he cannot pay,
and though his name is still recognizable by the American
people he approaches his mid-twenties, he is out of the
limelight for so long that he might as well be dead.  </P>
<P>   Nava generously allows us to see Lymon relating in turn to
each of his wives, in one case having to break up a catfight
between two of them in Zola's lavish California home when
she discovers Elizabeth in his arms in Zola's own pool.  </P>
<P>   Of the three women, we probably root for Emira to win the
case. She is the girl scout of the threesome, one who is so
unused to alcohol that when the two other women have her
unwittingly drink a concoction known as Long Island iced tea,
she loses her chillout and carries on outrageously with her
courtroom enemies.  Halle Berry looks stunning as always
though with an excellent make-up, wig, and costume job she
appears 15 or 20 years older than she did in "Bulworth."  Paul
Mazursky is fine as the conniving record producer who
probably symbolizes the stature of quite a few in his
profession at the time--people who cynically stole millions
from their trusting clients through mischievous contracts. 
Larenz Tate, though, is the showstealer, looking enchanting
when in the height of his powers and a miserable wreck when
down and out.  </P>
<P>   When we learn at the conclusion what has happened to
Lymon's estate, it's as though we knew it all along. The
lawyers do the collecting, the clients are the pawns. 
Ironically, the film will probably not be seen the kids who are
the prime audience for the cinema in general, those who are
the same age as the hero of the story.  It takes place in an
era they'd consider ancient history and deals with a singer
whose career was over so quickly that few are likely to
recognize the name.</P>
