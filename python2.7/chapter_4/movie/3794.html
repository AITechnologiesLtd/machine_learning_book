<PRE>                                   POCAHONTAS
                       A film review by Jeffrey Graebner
                        Copyright 1995 Jeffrey Graebner</PRE>
<P>     In order to avoid the crowds of young children, I have long had a
policy of seeing Disney's new animated features at the latest possible
opening-night showing.  Since these showings are well past bedtime for
most children, the audience is primarily made up of adults.  Attending
these showings has helped to underscore a recent, general change in the
audience for these films.  When I saw BEAUTY AND THE BEAST at the late
showing, there were fewer than ten people in the theater.  For
POCAHONTAS, the show was nearly sold-out.</P>
<P>     While Disney's animated features have always been well-suited for
children, each of their recent efforts (primarily going back to THE
LITTLE MERMAID) have increasingly been directed at a much wider
audience.  Each new film has had a greater maturity and an increased
willingness to introduce serious themes that will be best appreciated
by the adults in the audience.  POCAHONTAS is by far Disney's most
serious and dramatic animated feature to date.  It is also one of their
best.</P>
<P>     Prior to the release of POCAHONTAS (and even after it, to an
extent) there has been a great deal of controversy surrounding the fact
that this is Disney's first animated portrayal of an event from
American history.  Historians questioned whether or not Disney would
treat the subject with respect.  They didn't need to worry.  The film
features some of the most vividly believable human characters ever
portrayed through animation and a powerfully dramatic and well-balanced
storyline.  The movie does not make the Indians into unrealistic saints
or the British into unredeemable villains.  Instead, it portrays them
all as human beings and explores their very real prejudices and fear of
the unknown.</P>
<P>     Admittedly, the film certainly isn't a very accurate portrayal of
history, but it is a bit hard to tell what *is* true with the story of
Pocahontas. About the only thing that historians agree on about the
Pocahontas story is that nobody knows what really happened.  On one
hand, many historians argue that Pocahontas probably was much younger
when she met John Smith than she is portrayed in the film.  On the
other hand, many other historians cite evidence that suggest that the
two may never have met *at all*.  In the long run, the story has become
more legend than reality (and Disney has always used the word "legend"
when discussing this film).  Disney was probably correct to simply do
whatever worked best dramatically.  Most importantly, the film remains
very true to the *spirit* of the story.</P>
<P>     While the characters are very human, they clearly are living in
the same fantasy universe where all Disney animated features take
place.  It is a world where magic really exists and where animals have
real personalities (wisely, though, the animal characters do not talk
in this film).  This doesn't seem to be an inappropriate setting for
telling the legend of POCAHONTAS. The fantasy elements of the film are
clearly derived from the spirituality and deep love for the natural
world that are very much a part of American Indian culture.</P>
<P>     Even though they are animated, it is obvious from the very first
scenes of this film that the human characters are not just cartoons.
We first meet the British sailors as they are saying farewell to their
loved ones before embarking on the journey to America.  In these few
brief shots, we are able to immediately see them as real people with
lives that go beyond the story being told in the film.</P>
<P>     Disney's system of assigning teams of animators to specific
characters really paid off here.  By having small groups of animators
concentrate all of their effort on just one character, they are able to
create very distinctive personalities.  In particular, the characters
in this film feature very natural and *consistent* facial expressions
and body language.  The audience can read a great deal of emotion
simply by watching the faces, much as you can with talented live-action
actors.  The American Indian characters are animated with a somewhat
angular style that may take a little getting used to for viewers more
familiar with the traditionally more rounded look of Disney's human
characters.  This style helps to make the characters very distinctive
and to provide an appropriate ethnicity.</P>
<P>     The voice actors are also all very well matched to the characters'
personalities.  The animators take advantage of the expressiveness of
the actors' voices and appropriately match it with body language.
American Indian actors provide the speaking voices for all of the
American Indian characters, lending a certain authenticity.  Irene
Bedard as Pocahontas and Russell Means as Powhatan are particularly
good.  As John Smith, Mel Gibson's voice is recognizable but not
distracting.  The animators obviously studied Gibson as he is
occasionally recognizable in Smith's facial expressions.  Among the
other British characters, David Ogden Stiers is particularly notable in
that he plays *two* characters providing both with very distinctive
voices.</P>
<P>     While all of the human characters in the film are well-realized,
Pocahontas and John Smith provide the core of the story.  Both are
among the finest characters that Disney has ever created.  The first
thing that is noticed about Pocahontas is how strikingly beautiful she
is, but soon her imagination, intelligence and inner strength capture
the majority of our attention.  The character shares the sense of
wonder and vivid imagination of other Disney heroines, but there is an
overall complexity to the character that they have rarely achieved
before.</P>
<P>     Smith is also quite complex.  He is the character that grows and
changes the most over the course of the film, but it isn't a radical or
unnatural change.  His reputation as an expert "savage hunter" is
presented from the beginning, but it doesn't take long to learn that
there is much more to him than this.  He has the spirit of an explorer
with an active passion for discovery.  Smith and Pocahontas really do
seem to connect in the film.  It seems a bit odd to talk about
chemistry between two drawn characters, but the word does apply.</P>
<P>     Beyond the two leads, the film manages to remain focused on a
small, easily managed group of characters.  Of the Englishman, we
primarily become acquainted with two supporting characters.  Governor
Ratcliffe is the leader of the expedition and the film's main human
villain.  Thomas is a young sailor who is torn between loyalty to Smith
and his duty to Ratcliffe.  Of the Indians, there are three main
supporting characters.  Powhatan is the chief of the tribe and
Pocahontas' father.  Kocoum is a powerful warrior who is Powhatan's
choice for Pocahontas to marry and who represents a possible "safe"
path for Pocahontas' life to take. Finally, Nakoma is Pocahontas' best
friend and confidant.</P>
<P>     None of these supporting characters are allowed to overwhelm the
central story of Pocahontas and John Smith, but instead they are truly
allowed to *support* that story.  The central theme of this film is the
dangers of ignorance and prejudice and each of these characters help to
provide characters that demonstrate those emotions.  Late in the film,
the prejudices and concerns of these characters spark a powerful
incident that leads to the film's climax.  The final twenty minutes or
so of the film are among the most serious and intense events ever
portrayed in a Disney film.</P>
<P>     Some may complain that Ratcliffe is a relatively weak villain for
a Disney film, where the villains are often the most interesting
characters.  In truth, Ratcliffe is *not* the main villain in this
film.  The real villains  are the much more abstract concepts mentioned
above.  Ratcliffe simply serves as a personification of ignorance.  In
addition, Ratcliffe's overwhelming greed (a desire to find gold
consistently remains his main motivation) prevents him from ever
opening his eyes to the reality of the situation.  Still, even the more
sympathetic characters, including, at first, both Pocahontas and John
Smith, are required to overcome their ignorance.</P>
<P>     One of the most unusual devices used in this film is to give
Pocahontas a spirit mentor who takes the form of a talking tree, voiced
by Linda Hunt with a great deal of wit.  Grandmother Willow serves as a
conscience and guide for Pocahontas and eventually for John Smith as
well.  She is also used as an ingenious way to dispense with the
language gap between the two main characters.  This is a device that
really can only work in animation, where suspension of disbelief comes
somewhat more easily.  Unfortunately, the film does drop the ball a bit
when the *other* Indian and British characters try to interact.  It is
not entirely clear who can understand whom.</P>
<P>     The general story and themes of this film are quite serious and
the tone of the film reflects that.  That doesn't mean that the movie
does not contain some very welcome comic relief.  The vast majority of
the comedy is provided by the animal characters.  Pocahontas is given a
raccoon named Meeko and a hummingbird named Flit as her constant
companions.  The animals do not speak, but they are given very
distinctive personalities.  A third animal, Ratcliffe's spoiled pet dog
Percy, eventually becomes mixed up with Meeko and Flit as well.  While
these animals frequently bring visual humor to the film, they also are
an active part of the story. Writers Carl Binder, Susannah Grant and
Phillip LaZebnik manage to use the relationship between Meeko and Percy
to draw a parallel to the conflict between the British and the
Indians.</P>
<P>     Like the vast majority of Disney's animated features, POCAHONTAS
is a musical.  The songs by composer Alan Menken and lyricist Stephen
Schwartz are exceptionally well integrated into the film.  Often, the
segue to the songs is so smooth that they actually seem to be a part of
the dialog.  Among Disney's animated musicals, only BEAUTY AND THE
BEAST came close to integrating the music so completely into the
story.  This level of integration may prevent the songs from seeming as
"memorable" since they lose a lot of their meaning taken out of the
context of the film.  It is really most important for the music to
serve the film, though, and this music does that *very* well.</P>
<P>     Several months before the film was released, Disney used the
entire performance of the song "Colors of the Wind" in a trailer.  As a
result, many people had already seen this sequence before the film came
out.  On its own, it was impressive (and probably helped to sell the
film), but it is a bit of a shame that most viewers will not get to
experience it for the first time in its proper context.  In the film,
this song is the point where John Smith's point-of-view truly begins to
change and it is quite powerful despite its familiarity.</P>
<P>     Menken and Schwartz provide a surprisingly hard-hitting song
called "Savages" that leads up to the film's emotional climax.  This is
a very gritty and angry song that is not likely to ever be featured on
Disney's child-oriented "sing along" collections.  Menken and Schwartz
deserve a great deal of credit for being willing to push the envelope
with this song.  Unfortunately, Disney did decide to tone the lyrics
down a bit just prior to the film's release (the original lyrics are
still included on the original pressing of the soundtrack CD).  It is a
shame that Disney was unwilling to let Schwartz's lyrics maintain their
full impact.</P>
<P>     As good as POCAHONTAS is, it still suffers from a problem common
to Disney's recent features.  While they have been willing to deal with
more serious and adult themes in their films, they still refuse to drop
their limits on the running time.  POCAHONTAS is actually only 80
minutes long and it definitely would have benefited from a little
additional time.  The recent Disney films have all rushed the middle
act a bit and that is once again the problem here.  The romance between
Pocahontas and John Smith is not given quite as much attention as it
deserves.</P>
<P>     It has been widely reported that a romantic duet between the two
characters was deleted late in the production (the music from the song
is still incorporated into Menken's background score and a pop version
plays over the end-credits).  It is fairly obvious where the song
*should* have gone and it may have been a mistake to remove it.  The
scene in question is one of the film's more dramatic moments, but it
did leave me feeling that it needed something a bit more.</P>
<P>        POCAHONTAS is yet another triumph from Disney's animation
department and is sure to be on my list of the best films of 1995. It
tells a powerful story that truly touched me emotionally.</P>
