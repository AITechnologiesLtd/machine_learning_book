<PRE>REGRET TO INFORM
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>When she was 24 years old, Barbara Sonneborn lost her husband, Jeff
Gurvitz, who died in the Vietnam War.  On the twentieth anniversary of
his death, she decided to go to Vietnam to see where he was killed in a
mortar attack.</P>
<P>REGRET TO INFORM is the moving, but frustrating, documentary that she
made about her experience as well as those of various American and
Vietnamese widows.  The film, which received an Academy Award nomination
last year for best documentary, has been opening slowly in theaters
around the United States.</P>
<P>Handsomely filmed by Emiko Omori, Daniel Reeves and Nancy Schiesari, the
images make the tragic story palpable.  Organized into a series of
interviews with the widows, the film intersperses archival footage of
the war and pastoral scenes of Vietnam today.</P>
<P>As someone whose best neighborhood buddy was killed in the war, the
movie brought back painful memories.  Silly as it might seem, when a
section of the Vietnam memorial was shown, I tried hard to catch a
glimpse of some of the names of my friends who perished.  Not to do so
would have felt like a disservice to them.</P>
<P>Global conflicts, such as the two World Wars, are full of glory than
lingers forever.  Civil wars, like those in Vietnam or Korea in which
the US chose to participate, have at best a fleeting glory.  People
quickly forget them.   Movies such as REGRET TO INFORM keep these
important memories alive.</P>
<P>The significant downside to REGRET TO INFORM is that it is essentially a
propaganda piece since its views are completely one-sided.  Sonneborn
turns a gut-wrenchingly complex situation into a simplistically easy
one.  She points out that the people of Vietnam call it the American
War, as if that were a major revelation.</P>
<P>If you know nothing about the war (many of the kids in our schools today
know little), then this documentary would leave you with two strong
impressions.  First, the barbaric Americans invaded a helplessly
agrarian society for no obvious purpose.  Second, that many atrocities
were committed, and all were done by American soldiers against innocent
Vietnamese men, women and children civilians.</P>
<P>Although we hear again and again about all of the wrongs that the
Americans committed, never do we hear anything about the Vietnam civil
war, Communism vs. Democracy or the Vietnamese atrocities against the
Americans.  The American soldiers who were beaten and killed in
captivity deserve some recognition.</P>
<P>Documentarians can produce good movies even if they are slanted.  The
people who died in the war deserve to be remembered.  REGRET TO INFORM
does this, for which it should be commended.</P>
<P>REGRET TO INFORM runs just 1:12.  It is not rated but would be PG-13 for
some war footage and would be fine for kids around 12 and up.</P>
