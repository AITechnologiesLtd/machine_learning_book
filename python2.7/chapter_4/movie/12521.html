<PRE>THE HORSE WHISPERER
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>In what may be (and probably should be) Robert Redford's last romantic
leading role, he has chosen to adapt Nicholas Evan's popular pulp
romantic novel Yet, while the Horse Whisperer is a beautiful film to
watch, its romance never gets aflame.</P>
<P>After a riding accident in upstate New York, young Grace MacLean
(Scarlett Johansson) is seriously injured, and her horse, Pilgrim, is
wounded and crazed.  Grace's mother, Annie (Kristin Scott Thomas)
believes the horse is the key to rehabilitating her despondent
daughter.  If Pilgrim can recover, perhaps her daughter can as well.</P>
<P>To this end, Annie seeks out the country's best horse doctor.  She
discovers an article about Tom Booker (Robert Redford), a horse
whisperer who applies patience and an intuitive understanding to horses
and their problems.  Even though an initial contact with Tom proves
fruitless, Annie resolves to haul Grace and Pilgrim halfway across the
country to Tom's Montana ranch.</P>
<P>There, with her bullheaded ways, she convinces Tom to help retame
Pilgrim.  Over the weeks which follow, she gets to know Tom and his
family (brother Frank (Chris Cooper), and sister-in-law Diane (Dianne
Wiest)), and grows to appreciate the Montana countryside.  But can Annie
remain faithful to her husband, Robert (Sam Neill), and her cluttered
New York lifestyle, or will the charms of Tom and Montana be too great
to bear?</P>
<P>In the end, it doesn't matter much.  As a romance, The Horse Whisperer
is terribly flawed.  The problem rests on Kristen Scott Thomas'
shoulders. She does such a good job at portraying how stubborn and
domineering Annie is, that her character comes off as mean and
cold...two traits that aren't conducive to passionate romance.</P>
<P>Luckily, there's more to The Horse Whisperer, otherwise the film would
be a complete waste.  The film's parallel rehabilitation story of
Pilgrim and Grace works very well (especially in contrast to the
romance).  Redford works much better as a paternal than a romantic
interest in this film. And Scarlet Johansson handles her difficult role
excellently.</P>
<P>Then, of course, the film is extremely well photographed, as can be
expected for an outdoor film in Montana.  But the cinematography doesn't
end purely with the scenery.  The film is shot in two differing aspect
ratios (a confining one for the New York sequences, and then glorious
widescreen for Montana.)  The animal photography is very good as well,
particularly over the opening and closing credits.</P>
<P>Although The Horse Whisperer might not be romantic, it is moving... and
a good looking film to boot.</P>
