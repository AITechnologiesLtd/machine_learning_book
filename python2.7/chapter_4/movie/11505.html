<P>by Curtis Edmonds -- <A HREF="mailto:blueduck@hsbr.org">blueduck@hsbr.org</A></P>
<P>The premise of Wag the Dog is so simple that it's adequately explained
by the commercials.  With 11 days to go until the election, the
President (who we never see) calls in political dirty-tricks artist
Robert DeNiro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal.
DeNiro enlists Hollywood producer Dustin Hoffman to produce a "pageant",
a phony war against Albania, fought on the blue screens of Hollywood and
the recording studios of Nashville, with Woody Harrelson as the
reluctant, psychotic hero.  And if there wasn't anything more to the
movie than this, it would be a second-rate heist comedy at best,
enlivened by great actors -- like Sneakers Goes to Washington.  (A heist
comedy?  Yup.  DeNiro and Hoffman are "stealing" the election, so to
speak, and the movie is more about how they do it -- and the fun they
have doing it -- than anything else.)</P>
<P>Wag the Dog succeeds because it's based one great truth:  The American
people are stupid.  OK, maybe it's not "love thy neighbor as thyself" or
even "two plus two makes four", but a truth nonetheless.  (Any average
person who thinks that they're really smart about the two things this
movie satirizes -- moviemaking and the political process -- is invited,
nay, challenged, to spend a week either watching a movie actually being
made or 48 hours straight watching C-SPAN when the House is in
session.)  And because we're so utterly, predictably stupid, Hollywood
knows that a certain percentage of us will go see Hard Rain or Magoo,
Washington knows that  we won't notice a few million dollars spent here
and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies -- and DeNiro's
character knows that American geography skills are so weak that we won't
be able to locate Albania on the map.</P>
<P>The beauty of Wag the Dog is that it isn't a light, meaningless comedy
about politics (like Speechless, the Michael Keaton - Geena Davis
picture) or from the level of light-hearted politcal satire to
near-greatness. Nor is it a hard-edged cynical look at the manner in
which a morally-deprived, ethically challenged baby-boomer connives his
sleazy way into the White House (like Primary Colors -- and yes, I am a
little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out, thanks
for asking).  Instead, David Mamet's script strikes that delicate
balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire.  It does this by
keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers' schemes come
off beautifully, and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion.</P>
<P>DeNiro is playing a variation on his  Al Capone character from The
Untouchables, without any of the violent rages. It's all:  "What do I
love?  What is it that brings me joy?  Baseball," minus the savage
bloody beating with the bat.  He threatens a lot of people, mind you,
but he's doing it in a very nice, polite way.  It's a very mellow,
restrained performance, which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in
the script.  Hoffman, on the other hand, is giddy, exuberant and
joyous.  This kind of thing is what his character lives for, and he's so
excited that he can't even shut up.  Even on the edge of disaster, he's
bright-eyed (behind oddly tinted sunglasses) and positive.  Insiders
note that he's basing his character on some powerful-but-anonymous
producer -- which may or may not be true, but Hoffman still exudes the
kind of lets-put-on-a-show electricity that you figure a producer needs
to have.</P>
<P>The best part and the most frustrating part of Wag the Dog is in the
supporting cast.  The characters are so well drawn and so well acted
that we want to see more of them, listen to them talk in that wised-up
Mamet dialogue, get to know them better -- which we don't.  Anne Heche,
is dead-bang-on in her portrayal of a political press aide -- cool and
composed on the outside, panicked and frenzied on the outside.  Denis
Leary (one of my favorite actors -- see The Ref) is the "Fad King", who
handles the profitable "back-end" -- T-shirt tie ins and shoe contracts
and other creative, innovative ways to separate a fool from his money.
They could make a whole movie, just about the Fad King, and I'd go see
it.  Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard handle the musical end of things
fabulously, from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song, to the weepy
country waltz, to the hilarious "Ballad of the Green Berets" parody.
Woody Harrelson has a brief, but memorable part as the overmedicated
"hero" of the Albanian conflict.  Craig T. Nelson, as the opposition
candidate, and the ever-reliable William H. Macy, as a wacky CIA agent,
are given surprisingly short shrift.  (One of my small gripes is that we
never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing.)</P>
<P>Wag the Dog is a funny movie about serious problems:  the trivialization
of American politics, the role of the press in dumbing down the issues,
the impact of Hollywood in creating campaign commercials, the reduction
of all things political to soundbites and sidebars -- the list goes on.
We can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our
national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens.  Wag the
Dog reminds us of what can happen if we don't.</P>
