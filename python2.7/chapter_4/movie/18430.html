<PRE>The Winslow Boy</PRE>
<P>Hitchcock would never claim to be an actor's director.  His emphasis was in
letting the casting do the work, and was far more interested in the
structure of the film, with each of the actors being used as pawns.  </P>
<P>David Mamet once wrote that his style is built on the same premise.  Never
mind with emoting or getting into character, or finding the person's
interior motivation.  Whooey.  Come up with an ingenius screenplay, an
intricate puzzle, and cast actors who you trust will be believable from the
get-go.  </P>
<P>To say David Mamet's name is to conjure up some of his great works.  Not
only is he an accomplished playwright (_Speed-the-Plow_,_GlenGarry Glen
Ross_) and screenwriter (_The Untouchables_) but he has two movies in his
repertoire that would have made Hitchcock proud.  _House of Games_ and last
year's _The Spanish Prisoner_.  If you haven't seen them yet, do so.</P>
<P>So it is with this anticipation that I went to see _The Winslow Boy_, his
latest.  It is altogether unique that it is the first film I've known in a
long, long, while that is rated G, but the film is really for adults. The
foul-mouthed characters of his R-rated films must be giggling somewhere.</P>
<P>Want a simple plot? Pre-teen Ronnie Winslow has just been expelled from
military school, with accusations that he has stolen a postal order.  He
claims innocence.  His father believes in him, and spends his estate's
riches to prove so.  That's _it_.</P>
<P>Want a cruel joke?  This film has all the components of a Hitchcock film,
only without Hitchcock.  You have the premise of the wrongly accused, only
to not follow it up with who actually did it.  We don't even see the too
much of the courtroom, and the triumphant climax is performed off-screen.</P>
<P>Instead, Mamet is far more concerned with the tensions within the family.
The patriarch (played effortlessly by Nigel Hawthorne), is quirky and
dignified, tough, caring, but a little reckless.  So the daughter (Rebecca
Pidgeon) has no dowry for her engagement.  So the elder son (Matthew
Pidgeon) can't go to college.  </P>
<P>Okay, fine.  But if false expectations can ruin a film, it certainly does so
here.  The film is passable, but I long for the bite of the earlier Mamet.
This has nothing to do with the G rating.  It has to do with showing scenes
that I expected to see.</P>
<P>Back to the actors-as-pawns directing methodology.  Such a style works as
far as the actors themselves are well cast.  Hawthorne--brilliant.  Jeremy
Northam--fabulous.  Rebecca Pidgeon--huh?  </P>
<P>The poor girl just plain can't act.  It would have been better if her words
were annunciated by a monotone voice-emulator than for her to say her lines.
I gave her the benefit of the doubt in _Prisoner_, only because I just
didn't know who she was.  But here she is, at the beginnings of the suffrage
movement, angry that she cannot marry, and she has the same, pause,
utterance-of-lines-and-no-more schtick.</P>
<P>I can enjoy period pieces as the next guy, and I can appreciate it when the
director goes out on a limb to try something new.  However, _The Winslow
Boy_ bored me.</P>
