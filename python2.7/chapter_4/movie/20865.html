<P>Traffic advisory: plan alternate box office route to bypass DRIVE ME
CRAZY and gridlock of crazed teens.  At the screening I attended, it
would have been easier to find a share of internet IPO stock than an
open seat (I doubt the stingiest broker you know could be more ruthless
than the giddy girls saving seats for their friends).  If this romantic
comedy is successful, chalk up another victory for marketing and another
loss for pop culture.</P>
<P>A more appropriate title for DRIVE ME CRAZY would be `Highway Through
Nebraska' – the plot is flat, has no turns, and is completely devoid of
scenery.  At least this boring ride only lasts 90 minutes.  In this
rehashed tale of teen angst, next door neighbors Nicole Maris (Melissa
Joan Hart – CAN'T HARDLY WAIT, `Sabrina, the Teenage Witch,' `Clarissa
Explains It All') and Chase Hammond (Adrian Grenier – CELEBRITY, THE
ADVENTURE OF SEBASTION COLE) are neighbors with almost nothing in
common.  She's `in,' he's in the alternative crowd.  When the star of
the basketball team snubs her affection and he gets dumped, they find
common ground in a plot to scam everyone into thinking they are an
item.  If the plan works, they hope their ex-loves will come crawling
back.  Hmmm, care to take a wild guess what happens?</P>
<P>Chase Hammond did a fair job with his role, though the performances as a
whole were barely lukewarm.  Susan May Pratt's depiction of Nicole's
backstabbing friend provides a mild respite from DRIVE's many pitfalls,
including a soundtrack starring The Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears.</P>
<P>If you want to relive the adolescent experience of feeling trapped in a
situation you think will never end, DRIVE ME CRAZY can take you there.
Unfortunately, this is a result of the film's painfully slow and obvious
development, awkward performances, and completely unoriginal script.
Even Clarissa can't explain how a movie this bad made it to the screen.</P>
