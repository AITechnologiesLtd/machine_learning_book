<PRE>                            STAR TREK: VOYAGER
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>     (Note: Many of the proper names in this review are undoubtedly
misspelled.  They are phoneticly accurate, at least as far as I can
tell.  Hey, I never was too hot with Earth languages.  Put me in front
of an extraterrestrial and I am hopeless.)</P>
<P>     After whole moments of anticipation, the fifth "Star Trek" series
(counting the animated episodes but not counting the films) has come
along and in spite of negative expectations the first episode is at
least mediocre.  Being mediocre it is probably the most impressive
"Star Trek" series premiere ever.</P>
<P>     The approach seems to be an acknowledgement on the part of the
producers that the original series had the most exciting concept.
"Star Trek" and "Star Trek Animated" took place in the frontiers of an
unexplored universe--extra-terra incognita, so to speak.  "Star Trek:
The Next Generation" took place in a universe much more cosmopolitan
with a more widespread Federation.  The "Next Generation" Enterprise
was less like the Golden Hind and than it was like the Queen Elizabeth
II.  "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine" also takes place in a universe that
is settled, but with a mousehole into a not very explored quadrant.
Still, it has not really taken much advantage of the possibility of
unknown civilizations on the other side of the hole.  Instead of an
exploring ship, it really takes place in a port.  The problem is that
all this leaves people hungry for the good old days when the universe
was less settled, back in the Sixties.  At least, that seems to be the
philosophy behind the new series, which uses a huge contrivance to move
the ship, the Voyager, seventy light-millennia away and into unexplored
territory.</P>
<P>     All of the artistic decisions point toward a recreation of aspects
of the first series.  Having success with the character of Spock who
had funny ears, the new series has a lot of alien life forms with funny
ears in funny shapes or in funny places.  But apparently no matter
where your ear are in this universe or what shape they are, the
language they are used to hearing is good, old-fashioned English.
Light from our sun reaching this quadrant would have had to leave our
sun something like 68,000 B.C. but everybody speaks a language that did
not leave Earth until the twentieth century A.D.</P>
<P>     Of course, the first thing that a "Star Trek" fan wants to see in
the new series is the Bridge.  No, not the bridge of the new starship,
but the bridging of the last series into the present one.  The first
episode of "The Next Generation" had DeForest Kelley show up as Old
Bones.  "The Next Generation" Enterprise docked at Deep Space Nine to
christen that series.  And not too originally, the Voyager also docks
at Deep Space Nine for a few nominal moments in the opening episode
until it is clear that the visit is just delaying the real story.  Each
older series lends legitimacy to the new series in that unbroken chain
of "Next Generation"s.  I wonder how will they manage next time with
the Voyager some seventy light-millennia from home?</P>
<P>     The crew of the Voyager is headed by Kate Mulgrew as Captain
Kathryn Janeway, who in the first episode we see in an array of
emotions from tender to tough--probably a wider range than a male
counterpart would have had to portray in the first outing.  Also along
is Tuvak, a black Vulcan, played by Tim Russ, who has the voice and
mannerisms right, but still looks distressingly like some "Saturday
Night Live" parody of a Vulcan.  The new comic relief is Neelix (Ethan
Phillips), a scruffy scavenger with a roguish way.  He looks like
something the cat caught and has been playing with for a week.  Another
member of the crew is B'Elanna Torres (played by Roxann Biggs-Dawson),
half Klingon, half human.  That means she only has subtle ridges over
her eyes where most Klingons look like they have horseshoe crabs glued
to their foreheads.  Then there is Chakotay (Robert Beltran), an
American Indian with a big tattoo on his forehead making him look like
that venerable old Indian Queequeg in MOBY DICK.  Also notable but not
present is Doc Zimmerman (Robert Picardo) a petulant physician who is
present only as a hologram--a perfect character for the 1990s, when
image is everything and substance is purely optional.</P>
<P>     The story starts with a Maquis ship in a STAR-WARS-like blaster
battle with a much bigger ship.  (If you don't know who the Maquis are,
don't worry.  It makes absolutely no difference to the plot who the
heck they are.  I'm not sure I remember myself and I'm reviewing the
episode.)  Suddenly the Maquis ship is plucked out of space by a ray of
some sort.  Cut to the credit sequence.</P>
<P>     Each new series has a more impressive-looking credit sequence.
This one has a theme by Jerry Goldsmith, who writes some of the most
majestic "Star Trek" music, like the theme from STAR TREK: THE MOTION
PICTURE which was reused for "Star Trek: The Next Generation."  The
score is actually by Jay Chattaway, but the theme was composed by
Goldsmith.  The sequence shows the Voyager flying through some
spectacular space scenery in the vacuum of space (except it clearly
does not look like a vacuum).  This is the first we see the new ship
which looks from some angles like a scrawny flying duck with a huge
bill.  Well, too late to change it now.</P>
<P>     The new Voyager, under the command of Janeway (and after a quick
and pointless docking at Deep Space Nine), heads off in search of the
missing Maquis ship and finds itself lost in space and plucked seventy
light-millennia away.  The story from there borrows from a number of
sources, starting with Ray Bradbury's "Mars Is Heaven" and continuing
with pieces of old "Star Trek"s, and even bits from the film TOWERING
INFERNO.  The script by Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor does not produce
great science fiction, but it does demonstrate the dramatic
intelligence by intentionally splitting up the nine major crew members
into groups of two or three to allow the viewer time to become familiar
with them.</P>
<P>     The style of the new series is polished and better than the
writing.  As is traditional in the series, the model effects work is
superb.  It is not as imaginative as some of the Video Toaster graphics
of "Babylon 5," but is still beautiful to look at.  In the "Star Trek"
tradition matte paintings of landscapes are spectacular, though not
always convincing.  Speaking of traditions, the computer still has
Majel Barrett's voice.  The traditional long scene of a shuttle flying
around a new ship, whichever new ship it is, is there but much shorter
than the minutes-long sequence in STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE.  Some
of the effects work is surprisingly understated.  The seventy light-
millenia trip shows up as just a simple generic spacestorm effect.  It
could have been a little more dramatic, considering it provided the
theme for the new series.  The costume design is occasionally a bit
silly.  One group called the Ocampo seem to be wearing scarves or their
collars over the lower part of their faces to give the impression of
Bazooka Joe.</P>
<P>     Until now the series has been trying to make the starship a
character and even gave it Majel Barrett's voice.  The writers have
taken the second step by giving the Voyager something called "bio-
neural circuitry."  One might wonder how much longer it will be before
we have a starship with human emotions ("Oh, please don't make me fire
on that...  Oh, no.  Now you did it.  Uh-oh!  They's firing back.  Will
you put up my shields please?  Ouch!  Hey, dammit, put up my shields
you bozos!")  Some of the science is questionable.  The Voyager travels
seventy light-millennia into unexplored space in seconds and almost
immediately the navigator knows where he is.  For some time the series
has been asking us to accept some peculiar things about hologram
technology and the ability to interact with it.  The Doc Zimmerman
hologram seems to be able to hug humans and hold up physical objects.
Along with the unexplained ability everybody has to understand English,
there seems to be a standard concept of what it means for a character
to live nine years.  Nobody asks anyone how long their years are, nor
even if they would get any useful information in the answer.  How do
you express to an alien who doesn't know how long it takes for your
planet to circle the sun how long a year is?</P>
<P>     There was one great moment in the episode for anyone who has ever
gotten fouled up by an uncooperative computer center.  Captain Janeway
confronts the alien being who has taken her ship and pulled it seventy
light-millennia off course.  Oops, coulda happened to anyone, right?
All she asks is that he undo the damage he has done and send the ship
back.  He stops his banjo-playing, looks her in the eye and whines
"Sending you back is complicated.  I just don't have the time."  I
wonder if he trained some of the computer centers I've worked with.</P>
<P>     Overall impression?  The series is okay and somewhat better than
expected.  But I am still a "Babylon 5" sort of guy.</P>
