<PRE>                            MISSISSIPPI MASALA
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<PRE>130 min., R, Drama, 1991
Director: Mira Nair
Cast: Denzel Washington, Roshan Seth, Sarita Chudhury,
      Sharmila Tangore, Charles S. Dutton</PRE>
<P>     Indian (from India) Sarita Chudhury, who moved from Africa to
Mississippi with her family 18 years before, meets Denzel Washington, a
Black who owns his own rug cleaning business.  The two fall in love, but
their relationship is threatened by Sarita Chudhury's father, who
dislikes Blacks.</P>
<P>     MISSISSIPPI MASALA is by the director of SALAAM BOMBAY!, and I feel
that it is a very good film, and definitely worth seeing.   I almost
didn't go to see this film, because the title, at least to me, sounded
boring, and I had only seen one preview for the film and it didn't tell
too much.  I give MISSISSIPPI MASALA a four on a scale of zero to five.
MISSISSIPPI MASALA is rated R for explicit language, adult situations,
and mild violence.</P>
<P>     When I saw the advertisements for MISSISSIPPI MASALA I wasn't quite
sure of what it was going to be about.  It looked like it was either
going to be a remake of ROMEO AND JULIET or an immigrant drama.  It was
more of a remake of ROMEO AND JULIET than an immigrant drama, but it
really wasn't either.</P>
<P>     Denzel Washington gave a great performance, along with the rest of
the cast.  What I think that I liked most about the film, was the
screenplay.  It was very well crafted and it held my interest throughout
the film.  Also the locations for the film were well-picked.  I don't
think that the film would have been nearly as good if the film was set
in a rich neighborhood.  </P>
<P>     I think that MISSISSIPPI MASALA deserved a better release than it
got, at least in my area.  My local art/import theater picked it up and
played it for four days.  If given the chance, I think that the film
would have done very well in a real movie theater, and gotten a bigger
audience.</P>
