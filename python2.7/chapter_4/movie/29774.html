<P>   While relationships between older men and younger men are 
de rigeuer in the movies--considered far more acceptable than 
the reverse--when the age difference is more than, say, twenty 
years, a quirky kind of poignancy can result. This is the case with 
Christine Lahti's "My First Mister," which may be yet another 
story about two lonely people who find themselves by finding 
each other, but despite its undeserved sugary ending is 
effectively heartwarming and heartbreaking in equal measure. 
The presence of the wonderful Albert Brooks insures that the 
comic angle will not be ignored, and this time our Mr. Brooks, 
once Eddie Cantor's sidekick, is endearing as he was in his self- 
directed "Mother."  Ms. Lahti, better known to the New York 
public as a stage performer with roles in "The Heidi Chronicles" 
and "Little Murders," uses Jill Franklyn's story effectively to bring 
out a quietly humorous and ironic side of the whimsical 
comedian. </P>
<P>   Lahti opens on a teen who is alienated to the point of self 
destruction, the type of young woman we often seen in urban 
thoroughfares with pierced body parts and tattoos, but who in her 
suburban surroundings stands out as a Fellini-esque freak.  As 
Jennifer, or J as she calls herself, Leelee Sobieski is 
recognizable more by her Helen-Hunt voice than by her physical 
resemblance to that celebrated actress.   With jet black hair and 
rings on just about part of her head except, notably, her ears, 
Sobieski performs in the role of an outsider in her school, in her 
home and in her community.  Surprisingly she is the only one in 
her English class with the punk attire and bejeweled 
physiognomy, her long sleeves covering a series of self-inflicted 
cuts that rest just above bold tattoos.  Possessing a mother, Mrs. 
Benson (Carol Kane), who jabbers and does not listen to her only 
child, a cipher of a stepdad (Michael McKean), and hostile stares 
in a conservative shopping mall, she is the type of person who 
can be saved only if she could somehow run into a like individual- 
-which she does in the guise of mild-mannered but amusing 49- 
year-old clothing store owner, Randall (Albert Brooks).  Though 
Randall's first instinct is to chase her out of his store, he 
apparently sees something in this girl that allows him to hire her 
first as a stock-room clerk only to move her up to salesperson 
after he gets her to dispense with her confrontational makeup. </P>
<P>   "My First Mister," which opened the Sundance festival in 
January 2001, treats these soul mates as people attracted to 
each other by both their differences and their affinities.  He 
dresses conservatively, not only to please his customers but to 
keep a low profile as though announcing to the world that his life 
is stable but sad.  She announces herself as heavy metal, attiring 
herself to fit in with a young urban crowd but despite her hangout 
at a punk coffee shop known as The Bourgeois Pig, she is 
ignored by everyone her own age, not excepting the kids in her 
class with "pretentious names like Ashley."  As they meet during 
business hours, they begin to work on each other's flaws, she 
determined to loosen up the haberdasher, he bent on bringing 
out her natural good looks.  Most important, both see themselves 
as needing the warmth and comfort of friends and family, 
providing both until they can go out into the larger community to 
make their way. </P>
<P>   Tension is generated as the audience ponders the limits of their 
affiliation.  Obviously friendship is involved but what about the 
sexual attraction that lies just under the surface?  As she is a girl 
with no friends her own age, we can hypothesize that the plump 
forty-nine year-old who is blessed with empathy as well as a solid 
sense of humor can appeal. When he invites her to his home and 
both simply lie back to catch a few winks, she at one point places 
his hand under her blouse.  The film would be fine were we to 
examine a bond between two people of diverse generations, 
each serving alternately as mentor to the other.  What make the 
film work big time is the barely expressed sexual tension which 
provides much of the spark in the connection. </P>
<P>   John Goodman's brief and not credible role as the girl's natural 
dad, a unreconstituted hippy in his early fifties, is the film's only 
weak point.  Otherwise, Carol Kane is fine as the not-so-atypical 
mom, existing on the fringe of her daughter's life, not really 
knowing how to listen and give forceful guidance to her suicidal 
daughter.  "My First Mister" is delightfully quirkly, providing smiles 
and tears and while it is marketed as an arty work would at no 
time be inaccessible to a broad film audience. </P>
