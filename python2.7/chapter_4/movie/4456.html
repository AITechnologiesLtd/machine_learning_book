<PRE>                       DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     It appears that Mel Brooks ought to retire from his long and
successful career as both actor and director.  His last films, LIFE
STINKS and DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT are sooo bad, it's pitiful.  I
would like to remember him for the great laughs he gave us over a long
career rather than for the ridiculous one note films he has been
turning out these past few years.  Mel, quit while you are still
ahead.</P>
<P>     In LIFE STINKS the whole story revolved around a very wealthy man
who gave up his all for one month to prove he could survive in the
sordid world.  In DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT, Dracula is a bumbling
idiot whose every scheme fails miserably.</P>
<P>     Satire is the most difficult form of comedy to write and
perform.  It's either brilliant or falls flat on its face.  This one
is not in the brilliant class despite heroic "shtick" by Leslie Nelson
as Dracula and Amy Yasbeck as the undersexed woman he tries to seduce.
Another "vampirette" is Lysette Anthony.</P>
<P>     Peter MacNicol is a groveling slave (remember Mel kissing the
boots of his lord and master in the wonderful 12 CHAIRS?) and Mel
himself plays a "vampireologist."   With the exception of 2 gags that
ARE funny, the remainder is an awful bore.  Mel: quit.</P>
