<PRE>SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER
**** OF **** grade is A+</PRE>
<P>Hey do you want to know why no GOOD family films are made?  BECAUSE YOU
WONT SEE THEM!  Hollywood is an enterprise and reacts to money, if you
don't shell out 7 bucks to see something smart like Searching for Bobby
Fischer and do for trash like Lost in Space, you will get more stupid
films.  I don't want to hear that no good family films are made because
you didn't see Searching for Bobby Fischer and wouldn't know what to do
if another such brilliant film came your way.</P>
<P>That being said, Searching for Bobby Fischer is one of the best and
smartest family films ever made.  A film that is heart-wrenching as it
is true to the family relationship.  I loved this film, it has an
insight on how children relate to their parents and how the parents want
to see them succeed in everything.</P>
<P>Josh (Max Pomeranc) is an ordinary 7 year-old kid who loves playing
baseball.  One day Josh is playing outside and finds a chess piece.  He
then teaches himself to play chess.  One day he is walking with his mom
(Joan Allen) and convinces her to stop at a park were hustlers play
competitive chess for money.  Josh sits and plays against a grungy man
and loses, but catches the eye of one hustler (Lawrence Fishburne) who
sees the move Josh puts on the guy and writes down his name as someone
to look out for.</P>
<P>His mother tells his father (Joe Mantegna) that he played chess and so
the father challenges the son to see how good he really is.  Josh loses
somewhat quickly and gives his father a shrug, but his mother sees
through this.  "Josh doesn't want to beat his dad." She tells him, so
the father plays him again.  This game is won by inspired play from
Josh.</P>
<P>The father finds a teacher for Josh, in a crusty old-timer (Ben Kingsly)
who teaches him first the basics and then to play like Bobby Fischer. 
Bobby Fischer is the greatest chess player of all time, who started at a
young age and went on to beat Russia and then go into captivity.  Many
parallels are made between him and Josh but there is one big difference,
Josh has too big a heart to hold his opponents in contempt.  Josh uses
the mixture of his teacher's knowledge and the street-smart chess
hustler to make it through chess tournaments.  </P>
<P>I made the statement that this film is one of the best family films ever
made, it is also one of the best films made in the nineties and a film I
have seen on repeated outings.  I also said that I love this film, and I
firmly believe that you will too if you see it.  You have no excuse now
that you have read this review.  We so rarely get to see truly great
films, please don't miss the chance to see this film.</P>
