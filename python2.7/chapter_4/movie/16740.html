<P>1998 was an extraordinary year for foreign films that made a big splash
in North America.  Roberto Benigni's 'Life is Beautiful' was the first
film in almost thirty years (since Costa-Gavras' 'Z' from Algeria in
1969) to be nominated for a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar as well as
in the mainstream Best Picture Oscar category.  'Central Station' is a
touching story also nominated for a Foreign Language Film Oscar
(Brazil).  In the mainstream categories, it is a nominee for Best
Actress for Fernanda Montenegro.  A role she makes the most of and she
carries the entire picture pretty much by herself.</P>
<P>Set in Brazil, she plays a clerk name Dora who works at the central
train station in Rio and has a very special occupation.  She sits at her
desk in the middle of the train station lobby and writes letters for
people who are illiterate.  People dictate want they want said and she
writes it all down by hand.  Her expertise as a retired school teacher
helps her a great deal.  She often takes the letters home where she
reads them with her man hungry friend Irene (Marilia Pera) and she
destroys many of the letters by taking it upon herself to decide which
letters are appropriate and which are not.  Sort of a motherly figure to
the young people she writes the letters for or you get the feeling she
is sort of like the mother in law from hell by the way she remarks about
some of the literature she's written for others.</P>
<P>One ordinary day at work, she composes a letter for a woman who wants to
send a message to the father of her young son.  The letter is full of
scorn as she fills the composition with hateful remarks by telling the
boy his father is worthless and so on and so on.  Later, after changing
her mind and having the letter altered to be a little more sincere, she
leaves the station with the boy and is killed is traffic after being hit
by a bus when the child becomes separated from her.  Dora takes the boy
in for a short while and later sends him to an agency that supposedly
finds homes in more prosperous places for the children such as the U.S.
and Europe.  Finding out the the agency is really a place where children
are killed off and their organs sold at very high prices, she steals the
boy back and has the criminals searching for her.  Having the letter in
hand that was to be sent to his father, Montenegro helps the young man
find his father by going on a cross country search for him.  Brazil is a
larger country than most people realize and their sprawling adventure is
most unusual, enjoyable and totally believable.</P>
<P>'Central Station' is sort of filmed like a documentary.  Ordinary but
effective camera work, simple locations, standard costumes but excellent
acting from all including that of Vincius de Oliveira who plays the
child in need.  The film is directed by Walter Salles and written by
Joao Emanuel Carneiro and Marcos Bernstein by on an original idea by
Salles.</P>
<P>It's one of those tear jerker films that has a meaningful ending and its
heart warming story of a woman who never married but has deep maternal
instincts is one that can and should be appreciated by anyone who hates
reading subtitles.  This film makes you forget that you're reading them
and makes you feel like you're reading the character's emotions.
Extraordinary!</P>
