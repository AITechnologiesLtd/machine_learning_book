<P>     Like Hal Hartley's AMATEUR, COURAGE develops as a noir thriller 
while simultaneously spoofing the genre.  This film has all the right 
elements:  a dark, evocative atmosphere, double and triple-crosses, 
multi-million dollar scams, and an appealing heroine.  It's a difficult 
task to pay homage to a film style while simultaneously parodying it.  
However, director Mario Camus establishes the perfect tone, leading to 
an entertaining romp through familiar-seeming territory that is subtly 
transformed by his lighthearted methods. </P>
<P>     Played with unbridled energy and enthusiasm by helium-voiced 
Veronica Forque (from KIKA), Juana is placed in a desperate position 
when her husband Simon, a frequenter of Spain's high finance inner 
circles, disappears -- apparently with a lot of money.  Everyone -- 
police, gangsters, and bankers -- wants something from Juana, but she 
knows nothing and refuses to lose faith in her beloved husband.  Things 
change, however, when Juana discovers that Simon has a mistress.  
Suddenly, it's pay back time. </P>
<P>     COURAGE displays a lot of offbeat humor as it toys with typical 
noir plot elements.  The ending is such a masterpiece of timing and 
trickery that it may surprise even thriller veterans.  Don't expect the 
traditional here -- Camus shuns anything remotely somber and his heroine 
is far from the usual femme fatale.  The result is a film that never 
takes itself too seriously, and, consequently, is a whole lot of fun to 
watch.   </P>
