<P>   There may still be some people out there who think that
you've got to be crazy to see a psychiatrist.  Not so long ago
a guy named Eagleburger was dropped from the vice
presidential ticket because he had visited a shrink.  But
anyone with a semblance of education knows that we all
have problems and that people who seek help are probably
the most stable of us all.  No wonder, then, that convicted
killers talk out their feelings only on the day they are to be
executed.  You'd never expect a member of the Mob to go on
the couch purely on his own volition, and since comedy is
often dependent for laughs on unexpected occurrences that
look silly (slipping on a banana peel, for example), a movie
like "Analyze This" should have no problems getting laughs. 
When a nationally known gangster weepingly pours out his
problems to a reluctant psychiatrist, the stage is set for
chuckles. </P>
<P>   "Analyze This" does get its share of chortles.  With one of
America's great comics, Billy Crystal, in the role of a
frightened shrink who is forced to blend in with members of
Organized Crime, how could it not?  The trouble is that
Robert De Niro, so suited for roles as sociopaths ("Taxi
Driver," ""The Godfather Part II," "Mean Streets"), is about as
convincing in the part of a vulnerable, whimpering mafioso as
Kenneth Branagh was as a clone of Woody Allen in
"Celebrity."  Casting De Niro with a comic constitution makes
as much sense as posting Billy Crystal as "Henry V."</P>
<P>   The story takes off after Dr. Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal)
accidentally rear-ends the car of a mafioso, Jelly (Joe
Viterelli), exposing a man who is tied up in its trunk.  He
hands his business card to Jelly (Joe Viterelli) who, in turn,
recommends that his boss, Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro),
contact the psychiatrist about anxiety attacks he had
experienced.  Their sessions together take on comic import
because the talking cure works only if the patient is educated,
liberal, and open-minded--everything that Vitti is not.
Alternately threatening his doctor and praising him ("You've
got a gift...yes you do...YES YOU DO!"), Vitti is at first
disappointed that his anxiety is not relieved in just ten
minutes, but ultimately the doctor is able to use both his
Freudian background and his ability to improvise to
successfully turn the gangster's life around.</P>
<P>   "Analyze This" is filled with standard psychiatrist jokes
together with some insights into Freudian thinking that would
sound tiresome to those who know, mind-boggling to those
who do not.  Take Ben Sobel's explanation of the Oedipal
conflict to a baffled new patient.  Guessing that Paul Vitti
unconsciously wanted to kill his father and have sex with his
mother, Vitti retorts incredulously, "Have you seen my
mother?"  Later he reports that he's afraid even to call his
mom after what the doctor had told him.</P>
<P>   The picture is anything but a rout, however, because the
masterful Billy Crystal shows his mettle as a stand-up comic
able to conform to romantic and other situations with his
stock of surprises.  He is at his best (as in "When Harry Met
Sally") when reacting to the demands of those he is with. In
the movie's choice scene, he is required to don a $1200 suit
and blend in with a score of gangsters at a Mafia summit
meeting.  Watching his mentor Jelly, he proceeds to throw his
arms around large and scary mobsters and kiss them on
each cheek.  In one such cuddle he mumbles "Easter
Weekend" to a gangster--apropos of nothing.  Crystal
succeeds as well in holding on to his fiance Laura (Lisa
Kudrow) even after Jelly has caused a disruption in their
Miami marriage ceremony--while fending off threats by his
patient's rival, Primo Sindone (Chazz Palminteri).</P>
<P>   Director Harold Ramis has proved himself in working with
comedy troupes that included Bill Murray, John Belushi and
Gilda Radner.  He is best known for directing lowbrow
comedies with box office appeal, such as "Meatball,"
"Caddyshack," and "National Lampoon's Vacation."  This time
he has raised his sights a few notches, elevating his material
with psychoanalytic terminology  This is a dependable idea
considering the top-notch comedian he is working with.  A
bad film featuring Crystal has not been made.  See it to
admire the talents of this master comedian and forget the
many ways that crackerjack actor Robert De Niro is
compelled to embarrass himself.</P>
