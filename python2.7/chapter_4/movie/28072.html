<P>I bet that if one were to ask the person-in-the street in any country 
to name some famous American painters, the answer would be "Andy 
Warhol" (1938-1987) and "Jackson Pollock," (1912-1956), most likely 
in that order. That's assuming that there would be an answer.</P>
<P>Those two artists were mega-stars in their day, but memory shrinks 
faster and faster; the past fades, and, most ironically, 
information,  while increasingly available in this Information Age, 
is seldom correctly digested.  (This state of things has its own 
logic, but that's another story).</P>
<P>Pollock went through several artistic phases. He was initially a 
figurative artist  (after studying with Thomas Hart Benton); then a 
semi-abstractionist; a surrealist; an major abstract expressionist; 
and more. (I am simplifying his complex and complicated career). The 
thread that runs through most of his stages is that the unconscious 
is the source of inspiration.</P>
<P>Starting in 1947 he innovated totally with "drip" painting which made 
him famous in many circles. In 1949 he was consecrated by a Life 
Magazine issue headlined by "Is he the greatest living painter in the 
United States?" Stardom and world-wide celebrity followed, as well as 
derision in certain quarters, including some artistic ones. He had 
exactly seven years left in his life.</P>
<P>Pollock was also an alcoholic and a manic-depressive who went through 
hospitalization and several psychoanalytic therapy sessions.</P>
<P>The admirable, versatile Ed Harris directs here his very first movie. 
When he read the 1991 Pulitzer Prize winner biography of Pollock by 
Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith, he became obsessed with 
turning it into a film. After more than a decade of planning, raising 
funds, going through the usual Odyssey that is the fate of many a 
non-moronic project. He was so influenced by Pollock's work that he 
started to paint.  Harris came up with a winner. Not the kind that 
pack in audiences and get showered by enough dollars to make  Brinks 
truck sag. --unless one believes in miracles--gets a large audiences 
and dollars that might make a Brinks truck sag. Not the  conveniently 
arranged,  fanciful biography genre that Hollywood calls "a biopic." 
Not a systematic, documentary or educational analysis. But a 
selective recreation of the life and times and above all the art of 
Jackson Pollock.</P>
<P>A flashforward of the now successful Pollock in 1950 leads back to 
the early 1940s. In convincingly recreated Greenwich Village, he 
lives and works in a modest apartment. There, Lee Krasner  who also 
lives and works in the area, suddenly appears to look at his 
work--and have a look at the painter too. Lee, also an artist, falls 
in love with the paintings, and with the man.</P>
<P>She becomes his advisor, companion and unofficial agent. I am 
reminded of Roman mythology's nymph Egeria who counseled King Numa 
Pompilius.  Pollock however is no king, and needs help from the 
artistic Establishment. Lee knows the ropes. She arranges a visit by 
Howard Putzel. He is fat, pleasant man, played by a totally 
unrecognizable Bud Cort.</P>
<P>Cort who will forever be in movie mythology as the suicidal young man 
who loves ever-young (at 79) Ruth Gordon in the now classic "Harold 
and Maude" (1972). And in 1970 he was in two Robert Altman cult 
movies, "MASH" and  "Brewster McCloud" in which he is Brewster who 
wants to fly inside the Houston Astrodome.</P>
<P>I wonder if the very good choice of Cort is not also a devious homage 
to Robert Altman who made "Vincent & Theo" (1990) one of the very 
best movies about a painter (Van Gogh), along with Maurice Pialat's 
"Van Gogh"(France, 1991).</P>
<P>Putzel is the talent spotter for millionaire art patron, collector 
and gallery-owner Peggy Guggenheim (the niece of Solomon G, She is 
played by Amy Madigan who is Harris' wife)  Peggy G. is a ball of 
fire. She may kvetch, she may think highly of herself ( in capital 
letters, as it were), but she unlocks the door to glory after seeing 
what Pollock can do. The film intimates that without the two women, 
Lee and Peggy, Pollock may not have made it. A cruciall and enjoyable 
sequence has Howard Putzel taking Ms. Guggenheim to see Pollock's 
works in the man's digs. After climbing several floors they find no 
one there. Jackson and Lee duo arrive late, when the visitors have 
returned to street level. Tenacious Lee has to push (metaphorically) 
peeved Peggy back upstairs.</P>
<P>The visit is the colorful start of success for Jackson. I'll skip 
details, except that later, at a reception in Peggy's luxurious 
dwelling, the inebriated fellow urinates on the burning logs in the 
fireplace, then has sex with Peggy. The act is not shown.(One wonders 
what the laws are about defamation of character -- even when the 
facts are true).</P>
<P>Lee proposes. She and Jackson marry. Later they move to a farmhouse 
in East Hampton, Long Island --where the movie's exteriors were shot. 
The in-film  chronology can be muddy at times. My clue to the effect 
that the move away from New York came after the war was provided by 
newly settled Pollock's first visit to a rural grocery. There, the 
owner mentions the splitting of the atom as well as the A-bomb. It's 
the script's gauche.way of orienting the audience.</P>
<P>Life for Lee Krasner is no bed of roses. Not because of material 
problems that are there but do not come up in the dialogue, but 
because Pollock is a psychological mess,  drinks and cannot hold his 
liquor,  chain-smokes (but not a single cough is ever heard),  blows 
hot or cold according to the turns his mental illness takes. By and 
large,  except for a couple of scenes with his artist buddies, he is 
taciturn, moody, inarticulate. He may suddenly insult his guests or 
behave terribly with Lee, do both at the same time.</P>
<P>Lee 's suffering wife is a particularly sad case. A very good painter 
in her own right, she apparently has given up her own work, or at 
least effaced it before Jackson's.  Her main raison d'etre is an 
almost fanatical belief in the man's talent.</P>
<P>When he first saw her work he told her "You're a damn good woman 
painter" which today is like saying "Some of my best friends are 
Negroes." Setting aside considerations of evolving semantics, the 
fact is that Pollock meant it. Yet he scarcely shows any interest in, 
or make mentions of,  her career, talent or possibilities. His mental 
problems are no alibi for this.  But then it is blindingly clear that 
the man is totally art-focused and unaware of his own self. After 
all, his is not a unique case -- or even a very unusual one. Many 
people obsessed with their mission or with art or science or, or, or 
(a long list) have a kind of tunnel vision (and tunnel feelings?) of 
the world around them. There is logic in the mostly comic movie 
characters such as the absent-minded professors, the inventors with 
their heads in the clouds, the musicians who. away from their 
instrument reside in another planet.</P>
<P>I last saw Ed Harris giving a wondrously multi-layered performance in 
Agnieszka Holland's fascinating "The Third Miracle" (1999), a  film 
which, deplorably, I have heard no one mention to this day. . In 
"Pollock," Harris is very good again, he IS Pollock--and does all the 
paintings himself, down to the much-awaited, inevitable Big Scene, 
that of "discovering" dribble or spatter or drip painting.
Harris paintings remind me of Van Meegeren's Fake Vermeers that 
fooled many an expert..  There's not an original Pollock in  sight. 
It's impressive.</P>
<P>But while demanding, the Harris role is not an involving one.. The 
key to this was given way back by Gertrude Stein speaking about 
fictional characters.  I quote from memory:  :"I always prefer the 
normal to the abnormal. The normal is so much more complex and 
interesting"</P>
<P>Both Harris and Marcia Gay Harden were Oscar nominations, as they 
should have been. Their performances are of the cumulativr kind : you 
don't so much recall vividly this or that scene as you get an overall 
feeling.</P>
<P>The movie is beautifully but not "artsily" photographed. Blessedly, 
it eschews protracted scenes or sequences. It is also somewhat 
disjointed. It does give us an idea about the couple, far more about 
Pollock's painting process than about his "inner" self. But we cannot 
ask it to succeed where psychoanalysis obviously failed. The bottom 
line is that we, the audience, are, or shoud be, far more attentive 
to the paintings and their processes than to Jackson's mercurial 
behavior, his fits, his weirdnesses, or his calm moments.</P>
<P>The unloquacious Jackson's mind and soul are all in his work, period. 
A mini-series would  have fleshed out the period but could probably 
not take Jackson any farther. ( And it would certainly be a 
commercial fiasco.)</P>
<P>Relatives and friends do come and go as if they were on short subway 
rides and not for the whole trip. The first place goes to the 
influential art critic Clement Greenberg who championed and helped 
Pollock, yet was later critical of his work. He is played by Jeffrey 
Tambor, unusually changed and aged since his terrific Hank in "The 
Larry Sanders Show."</P>
<P>Most other characters make short, lightweight appearances, including 
Val Kilmer who shows twice in the walk-on (better, the sit-on) part 
of Willem de Kooning, Pollock's friend as well as his main rival.</P>
<P>A note for cinephiles.  Co-scriptwriter Susan J. Emschwiller is the 
daughter of Ed Emschwiller who made his mark as an important 
avant-gardist during the glory days of Underground cinema.</P>
