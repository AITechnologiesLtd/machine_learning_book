<PRE>La Grande illusion (1937)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 81</PRE>
<P>"The Grande Illusion" is a French film set during
World War I.  While the main subject is the plight
of French prisoners of war held in Germany, the film
also explores themes of class conflict, and the
desire to be free and living in one's own country.</P>
<P>Marechal (Jean Gabin) and de Boeldieu (Pierre Fresnay)
are pilots shot down by German aristocrat von
Rauffenstein (Erich von Stroheim).  Taken prisoner,
the pilots are introduced to Rauffenstein, who proves
a gracious host.  They are soon taken to a POW camp
in Germany, where prisoners fight the tedium by plotting
escapes and even by cross-dressing.  Eventually, Marechal
and de Boeldieu, along with Jewish officer Rosenthal
(Marcel Dalio) are re-united with Rauffenstein, now
a POW camp commander afflicted with war injuries.</P>
<P>de Boeldieu must decide whether his loyalties lie
with France or with gentlemanly snob von Rauffenstein.
Marechal must reconcile both his prejudice against
Rosenthal and his working class contempt for white-gloved
de Boeldieu.  "The Grand Illusion" also questions
whether aristocrats can survive in the new order emerging
from the tumultous world war.</P>
<P>"The Grand Illusion" is considered by some to be the
best film ever made.  While undeniably an excellent film,
IMHO it does not rank among the very best films.  It has
been called anti-war, but it doesn't convey that message
as well as "All Quiet on the Western Front" and "Paths of Glory",
or even "Full Metal Jacket".  The taking, losing and
re-capaturing of French cities, while implying the useless
waste of trench warfare, is depicted through second-hand
information, which lacks the visual impact of seeing soldiers
suffering in the field.  von Stroheim's character is remarkably
deep and sympathetic, but this does not apply to the French
officers.  Their characters, while perfectly credible, aren't
as deep.  Marechal is most interesting when conversing with
a cow, and Rosenthal when in despair over being abandoned
by Marechal in the German countryside.  At other times,
Marechal seems simply an opportunist, albeit an honest one.</P>
