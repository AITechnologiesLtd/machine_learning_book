<P>CrankyCritic® movie reviews: Guinevere
Starring Sarah Polley, Stephen Rea, Jean Smart, Gina Gershon, Paul
Dooley, Carrie Preston, Jasmine Guy
Written and Directed by Audrey Wells
website: www.miramax.com</P>
<PRE>IN SHORT: For the arthouse.</PRE>
<P>Didn't we see enough magazine articles about Hollywood's predilection
for teaming older actors and way too young for them actresses ad nauseam
in the past year? At least in the case of Guinevere the perpetrator is a
female, the writer of the most excellent The Truth About Cats and Dogs,
Audrey Wells. Wells makes her directorial debut with Guinevere, which is
a straight romance without any of the gentle humor found in Cats and
Dogs.</P>
<P>To call Harper Sloane (Sarah Polley) anything other than wallflower
would be an exaggeration. She hides behind closed doors, bottle in hand,
at her sister's wedding; Asks the wedding photographer to leave her out
of the photographs; Doesn't understand why the shutterbug, Cornelius
"Connie" Fitzpatrick (Stephen Rea) calls her "Guinevere". As we will
discover, it's an opening line that Connie has used many times before.</P>
<P>Connie's sole claim to fame is his one published book, "Street Glory,"
which connected him with his own patron (Paul Dooley), who bought
Connie's photographs as art. In between, he shoots weddings to pay the
end of the month rent on his industrial loft. Which brings us full
circle.</P>
<P>Like the mentor/student story of artists Alfred Steiglitz and Georgia
O'Keefe, referenced in the flick, Connie takes unfocussed young chicks
under his wing and puts them to work, discovering their creative sides
in photography, art, painting, or other creative processes. It's a good
thing to be a mentor, to guide the young on a path towards some
manifestation of enlightenment and, if you get a little on the side, or
in the darkroom, or on the roof, so much the better . . .</P>
<P>Stephen Rea brings his droopy dog-eyed look to the screen and Sarah
Polley is occasionally flitty, but why the pair connect on an emotional
level is quite beyond me. There's no sense that Connie is the proverbial
"dirty old man" though, as we meet earlier Guineveres (including Jasmine
Guy and the more prominent Gina Gershon) a pattern emerges. Harper's
family, believing that she is away at college, is initially deceived.
When Mom (Jean Smart) discovers the relationship, she reacts with a cold
fury and a savage verbal deconstruction as to Connie's motives. This
scene alone is worth the price of a ticket and earns Smart a place on my
end of year "best" list.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Guinevere, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$4.00</PRE>
<P>Pay per view level. Guinevere is just an OK flick for the indie arthouse
circuit.</P>
