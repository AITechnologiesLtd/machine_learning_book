<PRE>
 Notting Hill (1999) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Julia Roberts and Hugh
Grant.</PRE>
<P> The most telling line in "Notting Hill" has mega star Anna Scott (Julia
Roberts) telling her bookstore-owner boyfriend, William Thacker (Hugh
Grant), about Rita Hayworth.</P>
<P> Men, Hayworth used to say, would go to bed with "Gilda" (her most famous
movie character) and wake up with me.</P>
<P> Translation: Men would confuse the love goddess on screen with the real
person who, offscreen, had the same frailties and doubts as we mortals.</P>
<P> "Notting Hill" is a romantic fable that plays upon the fantasies in all us
ordinary men and women. You know the one: That Julia Roberts or Brad Pitt
would bump into you, and actually find you interesting. The two of you
would fall in love, marry and spend the rest of your lives happily ever
after.</P>
<P> Like I said, a fantasy. Let's be honest. You probably have a better chance
of winning Powerball.</P>
<P> The world in which a super celebrity orbits is so high above us common
folk these days that we would need an oxygen mask to reach such altitudes.</P>
<P> Yet, "Notting Hill," written by Richard Curtis (who penned the delightful
"Four Weddings and a Funeral"), so charmingly manipulates that very fantasy
that we swallow the premise entirely.</P>
<P> Anna and William meet at his travel bookstore. He is shy, she is weary.
They later collide - literally - on the street. It's one of those cute-meet
situations recognized by veteran moviegoers.</P>
<P> From there, a cautious, awkward and humorous mating dance begins as Anna
and William gingerly step into each others worlds.</P>
<P> To his credit, Curtis - as well as director Roger Michell - do not always
show Anna in a favorable light. After all, she is a superstar, and Roberts
is at her best when she acts the pampered, spoiled and self-centered role
of diva actress.</P>
<P> After the paparazzi discover Anna at William's apartment, for example, her
reaction centers only on how the situation and ensuing publicity will
affect her. She gives no thought to William and how the circumstances will
impact on his now-former life of anonymity..</P>
<P> Such are the nuances that hoist Notting Hill a notch above the usual,
predictable, romantic-comedy drivel that lately has infested movie screens.</P>
<P> Grant, of course, plays his usual charming, boyish character, with his
self-depreciating comments, his stammer and fluttering eyebrows. It becomes
a bit tiresome, but Grant has such a winning personality that you tend to
overlook this by-now overdone trademark.</P>
<P> A strong supporting cast of eccentrics, led by Welsh actor Rhys Ifans as
Spike, William's uncouth and unconventional roommate, aids in making
Notting Hill an enjoyable two hours,</P>
<P> Ifans is a comic natural who does not overplay his character nor allow him
to be wallowed in stereotype.</P>
<P> A quick cameo by Alec Baldwin as Anna's movie star boyfriend shows the
unconscious condescending nature that grips those who have gained fame and
are too ill-equipped to handle the social graces attached to such public
positions.</P>
<P> "Notting Hill" is a winner, a truly starry-eyed endeavor, complete with
sappy music, lovers' spats, reconciliations and good vibrations.</P>
<P> It's a quiet alternative to George Lucas' world of fantasy. Yet, in a
sense, it is just as much a once-upon-a-time story as the new "Star Wars"
saga.
Roberts is beautiful, Grant is charming, London is picturesque. What more
can you ask for?</P>
<P> Maybe a candlelight pasta dinner with Sophia Loren? Well, I can dream,
too, can't I?</P>
