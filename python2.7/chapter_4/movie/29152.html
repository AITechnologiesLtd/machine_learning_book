<P>Susan Granger's review of 'THE PRINCESS DIARIES" (Disney)</P>
<P>    The real significance of this formulaic, mildly amusing story about
an awkward teen who is horrified to discover that she's really royalty is its
success at the box-office. It opened as the second-biggest live-action G-rated
film, topped only by "101 Dalmatians" - meaning there's definitely an audience
that's hungry for family entertainment, given the right packaging. And there's
no better "packager" than Garry Marshall ("Pretty Woman") who skews the comedy
to appeal to young girls, adding a spoonful of Julie Andrews ("Mary Poppins")
for their mothers. </P>
<P>    In this contemporary fairy-tale, nerdy, klutzy, frizzy-haired Mia
Thermopolis (Anne Hathaway) is about to celebrate her 16th birthday when her
free-spirited, single artist mother (Caroline Goodall) casually mentions that
her grandmother is coming to San Francisco to meet her for tea. That's odd
because Mia's never met her late father nor his mother, Queen Clarisse Renaldi
(Julie Andrews) of Genovia, a tiny, mythical principality between France and
Spain. And when shy, wide-eyed Mia's told she'll inherit the throne, she's torn
between curiosity and terror. Guided by Andrews and aide-de-camp (Hector
Elizondo), Mia's lessons in prim, proper Princess behavior generate smiles and a
few chuckles but her transformation from ugly duckling into swan comes as no
surprise. Heather Matazarro scores as Mia's social-activist pal, but it's
venerable Julie Andrews who commands attention, particularly in a sequence in
which she cleverly "knights" a policeman and the conductor of the trolley-car
into which Mia has accidentally crashed her Mustang. Despite Gina Wendkos's
lame, predictable script, on the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Princess
Diaries" is a refreshing if schmaltzy, silly 6 - and a sequel is already planned.</P>
