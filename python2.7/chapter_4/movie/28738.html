<PRE>                            SEXY BEAST
               (a film review by Mark R. Leeper)</PRE>
<P>    CAPSULE: Gal is a 50s-ish London cockney gangster who has 
    retired to Spain.  His old associates want him for one last 
    job and send the vicious Don to give him an offer he can't 
    refuse.  A standout performance by Ben Kingsley as Don cannot 
    save what is essentially a set of cliches recycled from old 
    Westerns.  Rating: 4 (0 to 10), 0 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>Roger Ebert asks in his review OF SEXY BEAST, "Who would have 
guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent 
movies would be played by...  Ben Kingsley?"  My response would be 
that anyone who has seen Alan Arkin in WAIT UNTIL DARK, Henry 
Fonda in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, or Anthony Hopkins in THE 
SILENCE OF THE LAMBS should have guessed it.  They should know 
that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is 
cast someone who generally plays mild, sympathetic, or even 
ineffectual character roles.  The same characteristics that make 
an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor 
when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious.  That is the 
principle that works for Kingsley in SEXY BEAST.</P>
<P>Gary "Gal" Dove (played by Ray Winstone) has retired from a London 
career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in Spain.  Life 
has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing.  But his 
paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch.  The first 
punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the 
villa.  The second punch comes from Gal's past.  Back in London 
gang boss Teddy Bass (Ian McShane, TV's Lovejoy) is planning to 
break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants Gal.  He 
sends his most rabid henchman Don Logan (Ben Kingsley) to fetch 
Gal.  Don will accept any decision Gal makes from "yes" to 
"certainly."  However, if Gal says "no" Don will do whatever it 
takes to turn it into a yes including threatening Guy's ex-porn-
star wife DeeDee (Amanda Redman).  In the meantime Don knows just 
how to get under everybody's skin.  Kingsley makes Don a compact 
package of fury and nastiness.</P>
<P>There are some serious problems in Louis Mellis's and David 
Scinto's script that should have been caught before filming.  When 
we see the actual crime we have no idea why Gal was so important 
to its success.  Beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear, no 
special talents are required of him.  Any local hood could have 
done what Gal is needed for.  Additionally the crime involves 
digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault, flooding the 
vault.  No only could they have let the water out of the pool and 
avoided the complication altogether, but there is by far too much 
water to be accounted for by what was in the pool.</P>
<P>In spite of the provocative title, the story is cliched and overly 
familiar.  I know I have seen all the plot elements of SEXY BEAST 
in old Westerns like THE LAW AND JAKE WADE.  The story is usually 
of the reformed outlaw, a Robert Taylor type, who has hung up his 
guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability.  The old 
gang, however, wants to do one more job with their old buddy and 
sends a rabid Richard Widmark type to go and git ‘im.  It is not a 
great plot.  In SEXY BEAST even the plot twists have gray beards.  
Perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was 
made not as a Western but as a stylish British gangster film.  It 
is an old plot dressed up to look new.</P>
<P>If the plot is old, at least the style is creative.  This is 
director Jonathan Glazer's first film, but he has reputedly done 
some notable TV ads for Guinness Stout.  His style does have some 
unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences.  
Cinematographer Ivan Bird uses a lot of half lit scenes.  We see 
one side of a person's faces.  But the other side fades into the 
darkness, a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters 
in-habit.  Half of everything that is happening is also kept 
hidden.</P>
<P>We Yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog.  At least 
in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the 
quiet speaking, the heavy accents, and the cockney language.</P>
<P>SEXY BEAST is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability 
in the US by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel 
genre, the London crime film.  The plot may be new to British 
crime films, but it would be overly familiar as a Western.  
Further respectability comes from Ben Kingsley's high-powered 
performance.  I give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 
to +4 scale.</P>
