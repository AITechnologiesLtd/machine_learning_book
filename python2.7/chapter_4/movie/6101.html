<P>     FLIRT is one of those films where I appreciate the idea a lot more 
than its  execution.  In fact, even though the film features all the Hal 
Hartley trademarks -- offbeat dialogue, quick cuts, bizarre diversions -
- it loses its energy before the two-thirds point.  Despite a few clever 
twists, the last half-hour is tired, illustrating that not all 
intriguing premises can be successfully transformed into a solid motion 
pictures, no matter how talented the film maker is.</P>
<P>     FLIRT is actually a trilogy of shorts, all of which focus on 
identical subjects:  betrayal and uncertainty about love.  In fact, not 
only do the episodes explore similar issues, but they do so in exactly 
the same manner.  Each segment is a slightly distorted image of the 
other two, down to individual lines.  The characters and settings 
change, and there are small differences and individual quirks, but FLIRT 
is basically one story told three times.  The third time is definitely 
not a charm.  A certain amount of repetition is fine, but Hartley goes 
overboard, making this more suitable for film school study than 
theatrical entertainment.</P>
<P>     Story #1 takes place in New York City during February of 1993.  
Hartley alum, Martin Donovan (AMATEUR), plays Walter, a man with a 
dilemma.  His girlfriend, Emily (Parker Posey), has just issued an 
ultimatum:  commit to a relationship or watch her fly off to Paris.  
Walter is torn, and, after asking for a ninety minute reprieve, he seeks 
out another woman he's involved with to find out whether she's willing 
to commit to that relationship.  Instead of meeting the woman, however, 
he encounters her suicidal husband (Bill Sage), who is nursing a drink 
and a gun.  </P>
<P>     Story #2 takes place in Berlin during October of 1994.  This is a 
homosexual version of the same plot.  Here, the recipient of the 
ultimatum is Dwight (Dwight Ewell), and the person issuing it is an 
older man, not a woman.  Other than that, it's all basically the same:  
the uncertainty about commitment, the meeting with the gun-toting 
spouse, and the events that follow.  Story #3 is set in Tokyo, March 
1995.  The main character this time is a woman, Miho (Miho Nikaido, from 
TOKYO DECADENCE).  Her boyfriend is director Hal Hartley, and the gun-
wielder is her college professor's wife (Chikako Hara).  By this time, 
not only will you know what's going to happen, but you'll have whole 
chunks of dialogue memorized.</P>
<P>     There are times when FLIRT approaches brilliance.  During the first 
segment, Walter walks into the men's room and asks for advice from a 
stranger at a urinal and those in the stalls.  Their thoughtful, 
existential responses are hilarious.  In the Berlin episode, a group of 
construction workers discuss whether the director of this film has 
failed, and whether "the failure is interesting."  And, when in Tokyo, 
it's hard to miss that Hal Hartley is carrying a canister of film marked 
"True Fiction Pictures:  FLIRT".  Unfortunately, the movie only 
occasionally rises to this level.  Most of the time, it's just 
repetitive.  </P>
<P>     Akira Kurosawa's RASHOMON (which inspired this year's COURAGE UNDER 
FIRE) proved that it's possible to tell the same story more than once 
and still retain the audience's attention.  Perhaps if FLIRT had used 
RASHOMON's hook -- varying the viewpoint -- it would have been more 
involving.  As it is, however, the viewer's level of interest is likely 
to drop off long before the closing credits start to roll.  Frankly, if 
I wanted to see repeats of the same half-hour story, I'd watch 
television.  </P>
