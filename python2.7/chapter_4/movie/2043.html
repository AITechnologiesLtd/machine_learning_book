<P>     Despite his innocence, Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) has been
tried, convicted, and sentenced to die for the murder of his wife.  On
the bus ride that takes him to the prison where he will spend the rest
of his days, Kimble is accompanied by three other prisoners.  When they
stage an attempted escape, the driver of the bus loses control and it
plunges down an embankment.  Kimble is free.  Ninety minutes later,
Federal Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) arrives on the
scene to coordinate the search for the fugitive.  So, while Kimble
flees Gerard and his men, he begins his search for his wife's real
killer--a mysterious one-armed man (Andreas Katsulas).</P>
<P>     THE FUGITIVE is loosely based on the 1960s television series which
featured the late David Jansen in the title role.  The film takes a lot
of liberties with the original premise and characters, weaving a story
that barely resembles the one which entertained TV audiences more than
twenty years ago.  Back then, Dr. Kimble was on the run for week after
week, and there was more to each episode than the chase.  Now, however,
the flight lasts two hours, and catching the criminals is all that's on
anyone's mind.</P>
<P>     Oddly, even though THE FUGITIVE is an admitted chase movie, the
scenes before the hunt begins are among the best of the movie.
Everything surrounding the murder and trial, all told in a tremendously
well-edited fifteen minute prologue, is engrossing.  We don't see much
of the relationship between Richard and Helen Kimble, but what we're
presented with gives us insight into the double tragedy faced by the
doctor.  Not only is his beloved wife dead, but he's the one believed
by everyone to have killed her.  Kimble's character, revealed through
these scenes, is well in place by the time his sentence is read.</P>
<P>     Following the opening scenes, we're treated to over a half-hour of
nonstop action as Gerard and his men go after Kimble.
Well-photographed and directed with a flair, this part of the movie
keeps viewers on the edges of their seats.  Most importantly, when on
the run, Kimble acts like an intelligent human being.  Equally as
refreshing, the lawmen are his match, not a bunch of uniformed dunces
being run around in circles.</P>
<P>     In fact, it could be argued that both Kimble and Gerard are too
intelligent, not to mention too lucky. The plot is far from airtight,
and there are a number of contrivances that come into play to bring
about the resolution.  How much of these you accept depends on how much
license you're willing to give the film makers.  Considering the
overall quality of the movie, I think they deserve some room to
maneuver, and most of the plot hiccups didn't bother me.</P>
<P>     The movie's pace flags somewhat during the second hour as the
pursuit cools down and Kimble's own search for the one armed man takes
up screen time.  There's a little more talking and less action during
the middle portion of the movie.  Of course, the action predictably
starts to build again as the closing moments arrive.  The ending lacks
originality but is nevertheless more satisfying than not.</P>
<P>     Most of THE FUGITIVE's problems center around Kimble's
investigation of his wife's murder.  There are too many leaps of
intuition and handily placed clues.  The murder mystery is not
well-constructed and there's no way that the audience can figure out
who's responsible for the killing until the film reveals it (unless
they use the old tried-and-true method of guessing based on who is
among the least likely of suspects).  Simplifying this part of the
story might have resulted in a more tightly constructed plot, and a
little less confusion about the motivation of some of the characters.</P>
<P>     Personally, I wasn't that interested in Kimble's search.  Sure, I
wanted him to find the one armed man, but the lure of THE FUGITIVE is
the cat-and-mouse chase between the doctor and Gerard.  These moments
are at the heart of the movie; they make the picture work because it's
through them that suspense is developed.  Witness the scene at the
dam--the tension as the two main characters confront each other is
palpable.  A little more of this Kimble/Gerard interplay might have put
THE FUGITIVE squarely on the same level as another of the summer's big
thrillers, IN THE LINE OF FIRE.</P>
<P>     With all apologies to Harrison Ford, who turns in a far more
emotive and less wooden performance than in PATRIOT GAMES, the real
acting standout is Tommy Lee Jones.  For a man whose star has been on
the rise for the past couple of years, this may be the movie that
finally gets him into the upper echelon of today's performers.  He
invests his character with charisma and energy and, as Gerard's
grudging respect for Kimble grows, so does our appreciation of what
Jones is doing with his seemingly straightforward role.  Assuming that
Kimble is the good guy (which the script goes out of its way to make
clear), that means that Gerard, who's chasing him, is the bad guy.
And, as the film progresses, we can't help starting to like him.</P>
<P>     While no one could accuse THE FUGITIVE of having a masterful
insight into human nature, that's not why this film was produced.
There's an odd moment or two when an element of someone's behavior
strikes a responsive chord, but basically the characters are developed
only enough to keep us interested in them as the chase proceeds.  They,
like the sometimes overplotted story, are subordinate to the hunt.
Fans of the old TV series will find echoes of the show here, but most
of this version is new.  "Innovative" is not a legitimate description
of THE FUGITIVE, but "entertaining" is.</P>
