<P>To see Ben Elton's "Maybe Baby" is to suffer one of the most embarrassing of 
things -- a comedian straining to be funny. Successful humour comes out 
naturally and clearly; it doesn't need to be underlined, shouted or propped 
up by outlandish gags. There is a scene in this movie where a guy is being 
read the results of a sperm test, which tell him that a percentage of his 
little tadpoles are sluggish. "Sluggish?!" he cries. "Couldn't they have 
figured out a better way of putting it, like 'relaxed'? Relaxed sperm!" When 
he's told that some are swimming in the wrong direction: "Hello?! They're in 
a plastic cup!!"</P>
<P>These same lines could be funny, if the guy was desperately muttering them to 
himself, as rambling thoughts. I can picture Woody Allen playing it like 
that. But Hugh Laurie, the actor onscreen, shouts and makes expressive 
gestures, as if playing to a sitcom laughter track. A lot of "Maybe Baby" is 
like that -- although on the surface the problem seems to be a cheesy 
screenplay, it's actually the delivery that's off. I kept imagining what the 
dialogue would sound like if spoken more calmly, and much of it would be 
witty, warm and funny. That is not a defence of writer-director Elton, but 
simply an observation. Comedy is a fifty-fifty balancing act of writing and 
performing, so to screw up even one of these is no small matter.</P>
<P>The story involves a thirtysomething married couple -- happy, well-off, but 
desperately in want of a child. Sam (Laurie) and Lucy (Joely Richardson) make 
love morning and night, in time slots carefully planned around Lucy's 
menstrual cycle, but months go by without any sign of pregnancy. So they 
begin to try In Vitro Fertilisation treatment; a long, frustrating process 
that alternately tests their wits and brings them closer together, what with 
its great need for patience and emotional commitment.</P>
<P>It would be fascinating to see a real movie about the subject of IVF. "Maybe 
Baby" is not it. We don't get answers to our obvious curiosities, such as 
whether or not Sam and Lucy get a kid, or how they react to that success or 
failure. Instead, the plot veers off into Sam writing a screenplay about his 
marriage, producing it in secret, and then having to heal Lucy's anger when 
she finds out. Even when Elton is concentrating on the IVF storyline, he 
seems more interested in the goofy side-characters it gives him a chance to 
introduce. Among them are a loudmouth Scottish film director (Tom Hollander), 
a burlesque Australian nurse (Dawn French), and an insane gynaecologist who 
sadistically dangles his instruments (Rowan Atkinson). None of these people 
are believable, and since this isn't a slapstick comedy, that means they're 
not funny.</P>
<P>As I've said, anything perceptive that might have existed in the dialogue is 
ruined by the over-the-top delivery, so ultimately we're left with nothing 
interesting but a couple of sexy shots of Joely Richardson. Elton based 
"Maybe Baby" on his novel "Inconceivable", which he has said was inspired in 
concept but not content on his own IVF experiences. His reason for not making 
it more autobiographical was that he felt it would be more personally 
comfortable to invent contrived humour for the story than use the truth. 
That's exactly the opposite of how comedians are supposed to work.</P>
