<PRE>                                COLOR OF NIGHT
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Bruce Willis, Jane March, Ruben Blades, Lesley Ann
Warren, Brad Dourif, Scott Bakula.
Screenplay:  Matthew Chapman and Billy Ray.
Director:  Richard Rush.</P>
<P>     Director Richard Rush made his last film in 1980, a sly thriller
called THE STUNT MAN which was one of the year's critical favorites.
He waited nearly fifteen years before making his next film, COLOR OF
NIGHT.  And it looks like he may have to wait another fifteen years
before anyone *lets* him direct again.  COLOR OF NIGHT is just awful in
every conceivable way, lurching between tedium and wretched excess for
an excruciating two hours, and giving Bruce Willis his second
consecutive appearance in a first-degree bomb (following NORTH).</P>
<P>     Willis plays Bill Capa, a New York psychologist who is traumatized
when one of his patients commits suicide during a session.  He decides
to take a vacation in Los Angeles, and visits old college buddy Bob
Moore (Scott Bakula), himself a successful therapist.  When Moore is
murdered, evidence suggests someone in his Monday night therapy group,
which Capa takes over.  Soon, however, it appears that Capa may also be
the target of intended foul play.  He is also the target of attentions
from a young woman named Rose (Jane March) who seems to have a number
of secrets.</P>
<P>     If it were not for my personal code of ethics, I would reveal
every plot twist in COLOR OF NIGHT, since they are probably the only
thing which will keep anyone watching until the bitter end.  On the
other hand, I'm not even sure it's necessary.  COLOR OF NIGHT is so
sledgehammer-subtle that it would surprise me if anyone couldn't figure
out the identity of the killer in the first scene in which the
individual appears.  The attempts to turn the other characters into
suspects are so inept that I began to suspect that screenwriters
Matthew Chapman and Billy Ray were like those deeply troubled criminals
who *want* everyone to know exactly who did it.  Sadly, it's just one
of the many ways they treat the audience like it's made up of morons.
In one sequence, the killer uses a car to push another car off the top
level of a parking garage, endowed with a supernatural foreknowledge of
exactly where Willis is going to be walking below.  Then there are more
basic matters of stupidity, such as the condition from which the film
takes its title, Willis' inability to see red after the death of his
patient.  It has absolutely no bearing on the story, is sloppily
presented through occasional perspective shots, and is just another
example of the offensively simplistic psychology employed by the
screenwriters.</P>
<P>     The main question is whether the true criminals are the writers or
the actors.  With so much scenery chewing going on, they must have been
able to save a fortune on catering.  But who was the most abysmal?
Ruben Blades as the loose cannon detective who appears to be in dire
need of therapy himself?  Lesley Ann Warren as the
kleptomaniac/sexaholic refugee from a Tennessee Williams play?  Brad
Dourif (best-unknown as the voice of Chucky in the CHILD'S PLAY films)
as the obsessive-compulsive lawyer doing his impression of Dustin
Hoffman in RAIN MAN ("Yeah, definitely 58 books, definitely 58")?
COLOR OF NIGHT may have set back the cause of group therapy 30 years
with this collection of twitchy banshees.  And watching over them all
is the ever-smirking Willis, who even when he is supposed to be
radiating understanding looks like he's about to put on a pair of
shades and break into the Seagram's Wine Cooler jingle.  The whole
bunch should have their SAG privileges suspended.</P>
<P>     COLOR OF NIGHT was the subject of a much-publicized battle with
the MPAA over explicit sex scenes which threatened to earn it an NC-17
rating, but don't be duped.  COLOR OF NIGHT is about as sexy as a lump
of cold mashed potatoes, and less aesthetically pleasing.  It's also
extremely violent, particularly in the last fifteen minutes which
includes some intensely unpleasant business with a nail gun.  In 1980
Richard Rush clearly knew how to make a good movie.  I guess directing
isn't exactly like riding a bike.  Or in this case, like driving a
garbage truck.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 traumas:  0.</PRE>
