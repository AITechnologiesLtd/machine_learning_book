<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Eric Mendelsohn's "Judy Berlin" is a quiet, beautifully filmed drama about
the mundanity of the suburban lifestyle. Perhaps taking its cue from "The
Twilight Zone" (explicitly referenced) which often dealt with similar
themes, "Judy Berlin" examines the way people become trapped in their 
day-to-day life by interrupting their routine with the unexpected, and
depicting their reactions.</P>
<P>Set in the Long Island community of Babylon, "Judy Berlin" takes place on
a Tuesday in September. It is the second day of school. It is the day the
title character, an aspiring actress, is due to leave for California. It
is the day of a total solar eclipse. The principal of the local primary
school is Arthur Gold (Bob Dishy). His marriage to Alice (Madeline Kahn,
in her final film role) has long since exhausted its supply of affection,
and he is now engaged in vague, tentative flirtation with teacher Sue
Berlin (Barbara Barrie).</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Arthur and Alice's son David (Aaron Harnick) has returned home
from Hollywood, where he has been working as a director. David has given
up on life, and now endures an aimless existence, wandering the streets of
Babylon. He runs into Sue's daughter Judy (Edie Falco), who is leaving
town for Hollywood to break into movies. Acquaintances from their high
school days, David finds himself inviting Judy to lunch despite himself,
but his own experiences in the film industry threaten to taint Judy's
sunny outlook.</P>
<P>It may not be obvious at first just why the movie is named after Judy
Berlin. She is just one of several vital characters, and comes across as
more of a supporting player in David's personal drama than a central
protagonist on her own. But unlike all the other characters, Judy is
trying to break free of the prison that is Babylon. Her dreams may be
pleasant delusions (certainly, her acting abilities are more than a
little suspect), her future may well be awash in doubt and uncertainty,
but at least Judy is trying to craft her own future. The other principals
are trapped in the endless cycle of suburban life. Even David, who did
leave town once upon a time, never shed that mentality, and may indeed
subvert Judy's intentions with his cynical naysaying.</P>
<P>It is through Judy, and the eclipse, and a elderly retired teacher (Bette
Henritze) suffering from Alzheimer's that Mendelsohn gives his characters
a chance to break free of this cycle and, concurrently, illustrates just
how firmly ensconced in their routine they truly are. The story arc
involving Arthur and Sue is probably the best example of this: By the dim
light of the eclipse, Arthur finally decides to leave Alice and pursue a
relationship with Sue. But he is acting on pure, raw instinct -- "I don't
know what I'm doing," he confesses, and he could not be more truthful. 
Nothing in his life to date has prepared him for this deed; it is foreign
to him, no matter how much he desires it, and he fumbles through the
encounter like a child riding a bike for the first time.</P>
<P>Alice, meanwhile, undergoes an experience of self-revelation via the
eclipse. She is the only one who is really aware that it lasts an
unnaturally long time, and this is representative of the way she is slowly
becoming cognisant what is happening around here. She knows beyond a
shadow of a doubt that Arthur has left her and, moreover, she understands
why. Alice tries to comfort herself by making light of the strange
eclipse, pretending that she and her housekeeper are "space explorers",
but in a sense this is a very apt description. The experiences of the day
have led Alice into alien territory, a terrifying and foreign realisation
of life beyond the suburban routine.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, although there are many nice character moments in "Judy
Berlin", the movie never quite seems to come together; it is less than the
sum of its parts. Mendelsohn maintains a decent pace despite his quiet,
sometimes tedious subject matter, but a lot of the movie still feels
insubstantial. This stems largely from the fact that he has not chosen
particularly interesting characters; they serve their respective roles,
but most of them fail to really engage us in their struggles. There is
nothing distinctive enough to properly draw us in, and as a result, the
observations made about them carry less weight than they should.</P>
<P>Certainly, this is not the fault of the actors, who give generally
excellent performances. Dishy in particular is great to watch, finding a
nice range and perfectly expressing Arthur's deep, fundamental
confusion. Harnick is also commendable as David, believably portraying a
man utterly disinterested in himself and life in general. Kahn, who died
just three months after "Judy Berlin" debuted at the 1999 Toronto Film
Festival, has fun with her material, but also has an opportunity to 
demonstrate her sometimes overlooked dramatic skills (Alice's realisation
that Arthur has abandoned her is particular good). Of all the character
arcs, though, hers feels the least thought-out, and never really finds a
natural conclusion.</P>
<P>"Judy Berlin" is recorded entirely in black and white, and this is a
laudable decision by Mendelsohn. Not only does monochrome film accentuate
the surreality of Babylon under the eclipse, in the movie's early scenes
it also serves to hammer home the sheer mediocrity of suburban living.</P>
<P>In a way, though, this only emphasises the fact that "Judy Berlin" is more
an exercise of style than substance. It is lovely to watch, boasts very
good performers, and contains some good ideas. But the execution is less
than successful, as Mendelsohn never quite finds the proper vehicles
through which to express his themes. "Judy Berlin" is kind of like the old
cliche about Chinese food: enjoyable at the time, but afterward you're
left looking for more.</P>
