<P>Susan Granger's review of "PRINCESS MONONOKE" (Miramax Films)</P>
<P>Based on Japanese folklore, this captivating environmentalist
fable is the tale of a war between the beast gods of the forest and
the humans who are encroaching on their pristine territory. Set in the
15th century, a time of feudalism, the characters are desperately
grasping to understand and adjust to the coming industrialization and
how it will affect the balance of nature. In this English-dubbed
version, a young warrior, Ashitaka (voiced by Billy Crudup), is forced
to kill a fierce, demonic boar to protect his village. While dying,
the evil creature places a mysterious curse on him, signified by a
dark, twisting scar on his right arm. Defiant and determined to find a
cure, Ashitaka mounts his trusty red elk and travels to the boar's
homeland where he becomes involved in a dispute between Lady Eboshi
(Minnie Driver) and her feisty ironworkers and the forest creatures,
led by Moro, the Wolf Spirit (Gillian Anderson), and her adopted human
daughter, Mononoke ("spirits of things"), called San (Claire
Danes). The conclusion is a plea to humans to live harmoniously with
the world around us. Directed by Hayao Miyazaki, the Japanese version
is one of only two films to ever break $150 million at the Japanese
box-office - the other being "Titanic."  The fluid and superbly
detailed animation is technically awesome, emotionally powerful, and
unbelievably beautiful. I was particularly enchanted by the tiny,
ghost-like, head-clicking tree sprites. But - at a lengthy 135 minutes
- with scenes of graphic violence and a complex, philosophical
storyline to follow, it's definitely not meant for young
children. Heed the PG-13 rating.  Basically, it's art house fare. On
the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Princess Mononoke" is a stunning,
spiritual 7 - but it is definitely too much of a good thing.</P>
