<PRE>The Specialist (1995)
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1997 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: Not entertainment. A new form of slow torture.</P>
<P>Sometimes I wonder if I should be more faithless. I have a strange
wellspring of faith in me that tells me that Sylvester Stallone, with the
proper script and direction, would be great to watch. COPLAND went a long
way towards proving that. THE SPECIALIST, on the other hand, may very well
forever kill off what faith I did have.</P>
<P>Stallone plays a demolitions expert, formerly with "The Agency". In the
first scenes, he's been assigned to blow up a bridge in South America, the
better to kill a drug lord in a jeep. His associate (James Woods) and he
squabble when they learn there's a kid on board. The bridge blows up, a
fistfight ensues, and the scene ends so clumsily that it forgets to have
Stallone actually try and follow through on his promise to kill Woods.</P>
<P>Never mind. The flick has bigger fish to fry. It drags in (probably kicking
and screaming, although I bet they cut all that footage) Sharon Stone as a
woman with no apparent job or means of support who wants to pay Stallone
piles of money to blow slimy Eric Roberts into lots of itty bitty pieces.
Why? Because when she was young, she saw Roberts murder her father. Thus are
burning motivations born. Both actors look thoroughly Novocained. Given the
lines the/y are condemned to read, I suspect such treatment would have been
merciful.</P>
<P>Stallone and Stone spend most of the movie listening to recordings of each
other's voices. This doesn't just slow the movie down to a crawl; it makes
us shake our fists at the screen and scream, "Go meet somewhere and spare
us!"</P>
<P>THE SPECIALIST as a whole is an uninteresting succession of fights,
explosions, chases, sex-as-contact-sport, more explosions, and bombs with
convenient red LED timer displays. Nothing remotely surprising, interesting,
unique, or funny happens -- except for James Woods, who is always creepy and
over-the-top in everything he does. But aside from him, the film plays like
a catalog of everything that should be shot on sight in a movie.</P>
