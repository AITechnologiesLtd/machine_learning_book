<PRE>THE EXORCIST</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * * * 1/2</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: William Friedkin
Written by: William Peter Blatty</PRE>
<P>Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) isn't exactly your average twelve year old girl 
living in Georgetown. She does things like speak in tongues she's never 
learned, send objects flying around her room with her mind alone, and even 
makes her head twist around backwards. Her mother, Chris (Ellen Burstyn), 
has tried every doctor she can find, but they've been no help. After a 
psychiatrist tries hypnosis and is attacked by Regan, it is suggested she 
try more unorthodox methods. She gets in touch with Father Damien Karras 
(Jason Miller), a psychiatrist/priest at a local church. Father Karras is 
going through a spiritual crisis of his own, since his mother died just 
recently and he is questioning his faith. Nevertheless, he decides to visit 
Regan and determines she may, in fact, be possessed by a demon. The church 
decides to attempt an exorcism to remove the spirit, but that means calling 
in Father Merrin (Max von Sydow), the only man they know of who has 
performed one before. So Father Merrin travels to Georgetown, despite his 
health problems, and teams up with Father Karras to take on the demon in 
Regan.</P>
<P>While watching the "new and improved" version of William Peter Blatty's "The 
Exorcist", it occurred to me that I probably should have gone back and 
watched the original one more time. Afterall, I haven't seen the original 
for about six or seven years. So, I had to decide if I was going to review 
the film based on the changes, or simply review it as I would an original 
cut. Frankly, I still can't decide, so I'm going to try both. Even now, 
twenty seven years after its release, it's difficult to put your finger on 
just what it is that makes "The Exorcist" so eerie. Yes, I say eerie rather 
than scary. I know it scared audiences stiff back in '73, but "The Exorcist" 
has been downgraded from terrifying to really creepy over the years. Don't 
get me wrong, it's still an excellent film, it just can't compete with 
modern scares. So what makes the film so creepy? I know part of it is the 
way Friedkin sets up shots, but I think what really gets to us is the 
script, and specifically how well the characters are drawn. These characters 
seem like real people, with real problems, and as a result it hits close to 
home when things happen to them.</P>
<P>A lot of what makes the film's characters so real is that the actors 
portraying them are quite gifted. First up we have Jason Miller ("Rudy"), 
who almost underacts as Father Karras. I was sorry to see that Miller 
decided to go on to a career in writing rather than acting, because he 
brings a real humanity and depth to his character. On the other hand, we 
have Ellen Burstyn ("Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"), who overacts with 
abandon. If I had any faith in the Academy awards, I'd have been shocked by 
the fact that she received a nomination for her part in this film. Next up 
is Linda Blair (who has gone on to do nothing of import), who does an 
admirable job for being so young. Frankly, I'm a little shocked that her 
parents allowed her to appear in this movie. I can't help but think some of 
her actions here are what influenced her to go into the exploitation films 
later in her career ("Red Heat", anyone?). Lee J. Cobb ("How the West was 
Won") is excellent, if sadly underused, as the likeable Lt. Kinderman, who 
investigates a murder Regan may have committed. Finally we have Max von 
Sydow ("Needful Things") himself. I hate to use '90s jargon, but I simply 
have to utilize this term in regards to Sydow: he is the man. From an early 
scene where he squares off against a satanic statue on a hill, to a scene 
where Regan throws up on his face while he keeps reading from his bible, you 
know this is the guy you want to call to fight the forces of evil.</P>
<P>I said I was going to point out the few changes I actually noticed, so here 
goes. First, the infamous "spider walk" has been integrated into the film. I 
know peoples' opinions of this scene vary drastically, but I belong to that 
camp which finds the scene impossibly creepy. That one, brief scene alone 
gave me nightmares back when I first saw it, and I still can't handle seeing 
it now. Don't ask me to explain why I react that way, because I can't. 
Second, the film's ending has been altered slightly, and this was a bad 
idea. In the original version, Ellen hands Father Dyer (Reverend William 
O'Malley) the medallion dropped by Father Karras. Father Dyer walks to the 
house with it, stares down at those menacing concrete stairs, and the 
picture fades. In the new version the above events occur, but Father Dyer 
gives it back. No, wait, it doesn't stop there. He then meets up with 
Lieutenant Kinderman and the two talk about going to lunch and a movie. They 
wander off together and the film ends. Why these changes? I haven't the 
foggiest, but it ends the film on entirely the wrong note. The only other 
change I noticed was a minor one, but I'll note it anyway. In the middle of 
the exorcism, Father Karras and Father Merrin sit at the top of the stairs 
and have a philosophical discussion. It's an interesting discussion, but I 
don't think it was a necessary addition. It detracts from the action that 
takes place before and after.</P>
<P>I've often heard that the only people who will find "The Exorcist" scary are 
those who have deep religious beliefs. I don't think that's quite true. I 
don't have any deep religious beliefs (I'm a deist), but when I first saw 
the film it scared me silly. I've decided that a lot of the film's scares 
come from two elements: the set design, and the soundtrack. I didn't think 
it was possible for a simple concrete staircase to look eerie, but Friedkin 
pulls it off. A lot of his success is due to keeping the film's lighting low 
and giving each set a claustrophobic feel. As for the music, well, the music 
is everything. Jack Nitzsche's original score is brilliant, but I'd never 
want to buy the soundtrack since I'd never be able to sleep at night. I 
didn't think it was possible for "Tubular Bells" to inspire such feelings of 
dread. Are there flaws to "The Exorcist"? Of course, but they're negligible. 
The most prominent is the amount of time spent on the film's setup. It takes 
about an hour to get to the really spooky stuff. There is one scene I want 
to point out, one which makes me laugh like a madman whenever I see it. 
Regan is floating above the bed, the two priests are throwing holy water at 
her and shouting "The power of Christ commands you." They yell it over, and 
over, and over again. I didn't count the number of times but it must have 
been at least fifteen. I just want to reach in, shake Father Merrin, and 
shout "We get the point!" Oh well. The original version of "The Exorcist" 
runs a full 122 minutes. The new version runs a long 131. I'd recommend the 
film to those who want to see how to make a classic horror film and give it 
four and a half out of five stars.</P>
