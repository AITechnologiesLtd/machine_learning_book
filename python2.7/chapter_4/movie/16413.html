Mulan (1998) 4 stars out of 4</PRE>
<P>To paraphrase a song title from an earlier Disney movie, Mulan is a whole
new world.</P>
<P> The Mouse Factory's latest feature is a treasure, featuring magnificent
animation, a strong story and finely drawn characters.</P>
<P> Mulan is the story of a fiesty, head-strong young woman who, unlike other
Disney heroines, isn't seeking her Prince Charming,</P>
<P> Mulan's motivations are simple; to save her father, serve her country and
find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say.</P>
<P> The story of Mulan takes place in ancient China at a time when the Huns
have invaded the nation. The emperor has called for a conscription, one man
from each family to join the army and defend the nation.</P>
<P> Mulan's crippled father is called, but Mulan sneaks off, steals his armor
and takes his place.</P>
<P> Mulan is a saga of courage and self-discovery. Yet, despite the grim
backdrop of war, it is a lively tale of self-reliance and brain-over-brawn
that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy.</P>
<P> The movie utilizes a strong corps of Asian-American talent as the voices
for the main characters, including the wonderful Ming-Na Wen (The Joy Luck
Club) as Mulan, B.D. Wong as Shang, Mulan's commanding officer and later
love interest, Pat Morita as the Emperor and the veteran Soon-Tek Oh as
Mulan's proud, but loving father.</P>
<P> Also adding to the proceedings is Eddie Murphy as Mushu the dragon, sent
by Mulan's ancestors to watch over and help the young woman.</P>
<P> His fast, wise-cracking, hip-talking Mushu may seem out of place, but it's
a crowd pleasing performance, especially for the youngsters.</P>
<P> The movie features only a couple of songs, fewer than most previous Disney
animated flicks, but Mulan's are winners. The music by Matthew Wilder and
lyrics by David Zippel  fit nicely into the plot.</P>
<P> The overall score by Jerry Goldsmith also is a plus.</P>
<P> Mulan is a treat, more powerful than Hercules, with more heart than The
Hunchback of Notre Dame.</P>
<P> At about 85 minutes, Mulan moves rapidly, and will hold the attention of
youngsters from beginning to the end.</P>
<P> Mulan will set a new standard by which future animated efforts by Disney
and other studios will have to work hard to attain.</P>
<P> Also, it is hoped that the success of Mulan, and there is no doubt that it
will prove to be a popular vehicle, will spur an interest for more movies
with Oriential or Asian-American themes so as to provide more substantial
roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this
production.
It would be nice to see them on screen as well as hear them.</P>
