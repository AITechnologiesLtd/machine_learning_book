<P>As African American detective Vergil Tibbs questions a suspected white murderer
inside a jail cell, there is a wonderful, eye-catching shot which
instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film. The shot has
Tibbs' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars. To see these
bars blocking his face, we see how separated Tibbs is from the rest of the
characters in the film. As a black detective conducting an investigation in a
Southern town full of violent white bigots, no matter how innocent Tibbs is, he
is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his
skin. The bars show that Tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly
who he is, instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous. This one
shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds. It
perhaps may be the most powerful image I have seen in a film.        </P>
<P>"In the Heat of the Night" was the first and the best of the three films Norman
Jewison directed concerning racism in America. Jewison has a very keen style of
displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly
sentimental. In these three films he does an excellent job creating very
detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers. He is
also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the
past and is in the present. Preceding the very original "A Soldier's Story" and
the recently released "The Hurricane," "In the Heat of the Night contains some
classic lines and some very memorable characters. The film, which won best
picture in 1967 focuses on Vergil Tibbs, played superbly by Sidney Poitier as a
fearless African American police officer from Philadelphia who refuses to give
up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted. Tibbs is a man
who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is
constantly facing abuse from those around him. As a hero who is not afraid to
face off against five men with chains, Tibbs is the perfect protagonist.
Poitier also gives an excellent, noteworthy voice to his character. Never
nervous and always commanding, his speech patterns are very manipulative as
they range from stentorian to soothing. </P>
<P>However, unlike "The Hurricane" where Denzel Washington dominated over the rest
of the cast, Poitier shares the spotlight with Rod Steiger, who won best actor
for his excellent performance. As a sheriff who helps Tibbs and warns him of
the dangers around him, Steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role. He
starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople. He would refer to
Tibbs as "boy" and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him. As the film
progresses though, there is a very gradual change in the sheriff. He begins to
see the hardships Tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors.
What I really enjoyed about Steiger's character was that he did not completely
abandon his friends or connect with Tibbs at the end of the film. He still
could not refer to Tibbs as Mister Tibbs or Officer Tibbs but rather settled
for Virgil. Instead, it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the
world differently in the future. Most movies would have a character reversing
all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes. This action would not
have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe
something one day and believe something else the next day. Jewison's
determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here
and also very appropriate. </P>
<P>"In the Heat of the Night" shows the difference between the North and the South
or a major city and a small town in the United States during the 1960's. It
displays this perfectly. However, the actual investigation, although it is not
the main focus of the film, lacks interest. It seemed rushed especially towards
the end as if Jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like
giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim. There were way too
many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes
during this time period were inane (police officer Sam being a suspect was not
needed). Also, it is given that Tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is
the best at what he does, but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and
how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never
answered. </P>
<P>The rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable Jewison
classic. (A congratulations has to be given to actor Scott Wilson. He managed
to be in the two best movies of 1967, "In the Heat of the Night" and the even
better "In Cold Blood.")</P>
