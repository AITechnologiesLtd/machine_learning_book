<PRE>LUMINARIAS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>"Can't trust anyone, right?" Cindy (Seidy Lopez) asks rhetorically.
"That's right," shoots back Andrea (Evelina Fernández).</P>
<P>And in LUMINARIAS, a film that badly wants to be a Hispanic WAITING TO
EXHALE, the list of people not to trust starts with whites and men.  If
the film had railed so against blacks, there would be pickets in the
lobby.  But not to worry, the film's vituperative dialog by Evelina
Fernández, wife of the director, Jose Luis Valenzuela, is so preachy and
stilted that it's hard to take offense.  It's equally difficult to get
interested in any of the clichéd characters.</P>
<P>The story concerns the love lives of 4 Chicano women (played by Marta
DuBois, Angela Moya, Dyana Ortelli and Evelina Fernández) in LA.  Living
in what looks like the lap of luxury, they have nothing better to talk
about than the size of male private parts.  The belief is that whites
have the smallest.  We also learn that whites only date Chicanos in
order to feel superior.</P>
<P>Another topic of conversation is whether a Jewish man qualifies for the
full racial hatred that they reserve for whites.  It's a split decision.
Andrea is particularly embarrassed for having had sex with a Jewish
lawyer (Scott Bakula).  (When she explains to him that she has never
dated a Jew, he comes up with one of the movie's few jokes.  "Jew are
now," he tells us.  Ugh.)</P>
<P>When Andrea is confronted with the inconsistency of her attacks on
whites, most unprintable, and her dating a Jewish male, she shows the
usual chip on her shoulder.  "It's not a chip, it's a boulder," she
boasts to her friends.  And the film, which has all of the production
values of a TV movie of the week, never moves beyond such childish
diatribes.  If you're going to fill a film with insults, at least write
them a little more convincingly.</P>
<P>LUMINARIAS runs a long 1:40.  It is rated R for language and sexuality
and would be acceptable, although certainly not recommended, for high
school seniors and older.</P>
