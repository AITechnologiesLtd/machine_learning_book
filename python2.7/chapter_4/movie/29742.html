<PRE>                              FOCUS
               (a film review by Mark R. Leeper)</PRE>
<P>    CAPSULE: In the late years of World War II a man sees 
    anti-Semitic influences moving into his neighborhood but 
    wants to remain neutral.  As neutrality become more and 
    more difficult he struggles with his conscience.  Neil 
    Slavin directs this adaptation of a novel by Arthur Miller.  
    Rating: 7 (0 to 10), +2 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>FOCUS is a story of an anti-Semitic movement during the years of 
World War II, but it does not take place in Europe, but in the US.  
Kendrew Lascelles wrote the film based on Arthur Miller's 1945 
novel FOCUS.  It is the story of Fascism creeping into a middle-
class neighborhood.</P>
<P>Lawrence Newman (played by William H. Macy) lives with his mother.  
He works in a prosperous Manhattan company interviewing new 
applicants.  He interviews people applying for jobs and generally 
makes sure the company hires only the "right type," good gentiles.  
One of the people he turns down is non-Jewish Gertrude Hart (Laura 
Dern) who nonetheless looks too Jewish to be put in a visible 
position.</P>
<P>Lawrence happens to witnesses a tough-guy neighbor beat up a 
woman.  But he does not want to make trouble in the neighborhood 
by going to the police.  Another neighbor Fred (the intimidating 
Meat Loaf Aday) seems to be on a personal campaign to chase out of 
the neighborhood the corner news dealer, a Jew (David Paymer), to 
move out of the neighborhood.  When Lawrence gets new glasses, 
glasses that accidentally make him look Jewish; suddenly he gets a 
new view of his street and especially neighbor Fred who is 
inviting "Americanist" organizers into the neighborhood.  Lawrence 
tries desperately to hold onto his neutrality in the Jew-baiting 
in spite of the dictates of his conscience.</P>
<P>For his first feature film commercial producer Neal Slavin has 
chosen a particularly timely theme, that of a slow but insidious 
spreading prejudice and fascism.  The targeting of ethnic groups 
for particular hatreds is especially timely.  Particularly 
chilling is that Fred so anxious to introduce the same fascism 
that was currently engulfing Europe.</P>
<P>Slavin symbolizes the cycle of evil with the image of merry-go-
round accompanied by ominous music.  The film's one less than 
subtle touch is the big billboard at the end of the infiltrated 
street proclaiming "There's no way like the American way."</P>
<P>It is interesting that two of Arthur Miller's novels were adapted 
at the same time.  Like FOCUS, Amos Gitai's EDEN also was shown at 
the Toronto International Film Festival.  Both are about people 
caught up in evil circumstances and having to take a stand.  
However, FOCUS is by far the better of the two.  I rate it a 7 on 
the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
