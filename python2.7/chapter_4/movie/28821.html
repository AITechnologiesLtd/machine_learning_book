<P>PLOT:
A separated, glamorous, Hollywood couple must pretend to reunite for a press
junket of the last movie that they ever shot together. Kewl...now I only wish
that I could pretend never to have seen this movie...</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Trite, unfunny, boring and a waste of everyone's talent. How a premise with such
zest and bite can turn into a movie that doesn't feature any chemistry, any real
laughs, any surprises or any spice is beyond me. How Julia Roberts is used
solely as a "puppy dog" character, puttering around in the background while we
endure the complete bitchiness of Zeta-Jones' character, who is not one bit
funny or romantic (two ideal ingredients in a "romantic comedy"), is also beyond
me. And why they chose John Cusack, a great, quirky actor in his own right, to
play the most bland, uninteresting and unfetching character (with zero chemistry
with either of his leads) is further more, beyond me. And to anybody who decided
that this project was "funny" enough to greenlight featuring the talents
mentioned above, along with Billy Crystal, Christopher Walker, Seth Green and
Stanley Tucci...well, what can I say...I just don't have the words. So is this
the worst movie that I've seen all year? No. But it definitely sucks and it's
basically because...well, it's just not funny. And for the record, allow me to
state a few more problems with it. It starts off slow, it's got no energy, it
doesn't engage you with any of its characters (Julia barely gets somewhat
interesting in the film, everyone else...lame!), it utilizes way too many
flashbacks to move the story forward, it's utterly predictable, standard,
routine, see-through and uninteresting as a plot and it just sits there on the
screen, big and ugly, waiting...waiting for you to laugh or find something in it
that is amusing.</P>
<P>And then Hank Azaria shows up...aaaaaah, the film's savior (mind you, some might
be offended by his exaggeration of a stereotype, but that's another story
altogether). But when an experienced "voice" actor upstages all of the main
stars in a summer "blockbuster" romantic comedy with an over-the-top Antonio
Banderas accent, damn dude...your film's in trouble!! Rent this movie on video
just to see what went wrong yourself. The references to Ricky Ricardo and Senor
Wences (huh!?), the idio-plot points like when one of the characters goes on the
roof to stretch his arms out and relax, but everyone believes that he's going to
kill himself (hardy-har-har) and the cheap way of getting the audience to leave
the theater laughing by bringing back a ball-sniffing dog that has no place
being in the location at the end of the movie, well...I could go on. But I won't
because I do still respect all of the actors in this film and actually did laugh
at Azaria, Green and Tucci's antics from time to time (ironic, eh...what about
the leads, dammit!) and liked the premise behind the film (before I saw the
finished product, of course). A dud all the way around.</P>
<P>BTW, all the talk about this film was that Julia Roberts was to be in a fat suit
for one scene (her character is supposed to have lost 60 pounds), so when the
scene finally came, I did get a little excited about what it might look like and
then...well, it basically just looked like Julia Roberts in a fat suit! Ugh. I
think I'm gonna start drinking again after this lame-ass movie. C'mon Hollywood,
enough with the crud!</P>
