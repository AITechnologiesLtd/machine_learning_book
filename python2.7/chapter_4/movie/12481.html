<P>Low-budget action films like BLACK DOG are often power trips or playing
cards for either down-and-out or up-and-coming actors. Patrick Swayze,
having not starred in a motion picture in three years, might almost be
mistaken for an up-and-comer; that is, if we weren't all too aware that
his bewrinkled face was the same one we saw eleven years ago in DIRTY
DANCING. Whatever the case, though, this beyond-his-time actor and this
film both should've been kept on the shelves and not shown in most
first-run theaters nationwide. </P>
<P>Swayze is Jack Crews, an ex-trucker on parole who lost his trucking
license several years ago for vehicular manslaughter. He's now got a job
as a mechanic, struggling to make ends meet and provide a better life
for his wife Melanie (Brenda Strong) and his daughter Tracy (Erin
Broderick). When he needs nine thousand dollars to meet a past due house
payment, he takes an under-the-table offer from his boss to make one
last delivery from Atlanta to his home state of New Jersey. It will mean
breaking parole, and it will mean that he'll have to take the risk of
avoiding anyone who might want to hijack his shipment (hint, hint). </P>
<P>Right after Patrick Swayze, in the credits, are singers Meat Loaf and
Randy Travis. Both of them aren't fit for the job, and instead end up
giving over-the-top performances of outrageously comedic bad guys. They,
along with almost all of the other characters in the film, are
practically parodies of themselves, and only serve to heighten the
film's hokey atmosphere. Jumbled into the mix are a lot of non-sequitous
trucker stories (e.g., the black dog, or perhaps "slipping a gear" on
the way down a hill) that are surrounded by dialogues that don't extend
beyond two or three exchanges. The film wants to cultivate the
high-tension image of SPEED, but its car chases and crashes have the
laborious feel you'd expect from a Mack truck trying to make it up a
steep incline. </P>
<P>Nothing is particularly ideal for BLACK DOG, from its setup to its
characters to its plot, and even its opening weekend. Movie audiences
can usually spot the corny action movies, and while this Swayze vehicle
isn't immediately obvious as hokum, the first spoken line costs it any
chance it has to be genuine. Hollywood dollars and moviegoer dollars are
better spent elsewhere.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "BLACK DOG": 1.0 star - a poor movie.</P>
