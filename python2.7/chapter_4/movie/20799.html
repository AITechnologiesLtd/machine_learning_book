<P>Jurek Becker (1937-1997) was a Polish Jew born in Lodz --where the 
famous fim school is. He died in Germany. As a child, he survived 
Nazi camps. As an adult, he wrote Jakob the Liar. When this was made 
into the East German movie Jakob der Luegner (1974) by the able 
German director Frank Beyer, Becker provided also the script. The 
film was a well-deserved international success --artistically and 
"humanitarianly" (I don't know about box-office).</P>
<P>The title character is a modest "little man" who, during the 
ruthless Nazi annihilation of the Jews ("The Final Solution") in 
death camps, is in the ghetto of a Polish town. One day, when taken 
outside the ghetto to a Nazi office, he hears accidentally a German 
news bulletin that mentions the advance of the Russian army to a 
town not far from the ghetto. One thing leads to another. The ghetto 
denizens learn of this. They believe, because they want to believe, 
that Jakob has a hidden radio, a strictly "verboten" item punishable 
by the execution of its listeners.</P>
<P>The news raises the spirit of the captive Jews. Jakob becomes 
willy-nilly their regular provider of upbeat items (from the BBC) 
which he invents. These   bring small rays of hope into the ghetto's 
miserable, tragic life.</P>
<P>The current Jakob the Liar is a remake of the older one.  Whether or 
not you know the original, Jakob II is a moving experience of 
suffering and hope. As someone says later in the film, there was not 
a single suicide in the entire ghetto after the "news" started 
coming in. The fake information even contributes to the "better" 
health of Lina, a charming 10-year old whose parents, on their way 
to a death camp, were able to move her out of the train. She becomes 
the housemate of widower Jakob.</P>
<P>The original Jakob, however, was so good that the remake suffers by 
comparison.</P>
<P>Jakob II was directed by Peter Kassovitz, born ca.1938 in Budapest. 
His father and mother survived the death camps. Peter left Hungary 
after the Soviets suppressed the 1956 Hungarian uprising, went to 
France where he worked as a director (mostly TV) and where his son 
Mathieu Kassovitz was born (1967).</P>
<P>Mathieu has acted in many movies and directed 7 features to date, of 
which the best-known (and very goodt) are the Metisse (aka Cafe au 
Lait), La Haine (Hate) and Assassin (s) (sic). The latter has not 
been shown in the USA to my knowledge. Father and son often employ 
each other in their movies. In Jakob II Mathieu plays Herschel, the 
prizefighter in love. And, by the way, the much-talented Armin 
Muller-Stahl (as the famous doctor here) had a small part in the 
1974 Jakob the Liar.</P>
<P>The film was shot entirely in Eastern Europe using good, 
near-genuine locations for its ghetto. Among the Holocaust films, 
Life is Beautiful came out before Jakob II. Making it became a 
reality when Kassovitz wrote to  Robin Williams who, he thought, was 
Jewish.</P>
<P>Williams was approached also because he could provide a combination 
of humor and tragedy. Both co-exist in the movie, with strong doses 
of typical, often black Jewish humor. It is tempting to see the same 
strain in Life Is Beautiful, but Benigni's humor is more Italian 
than "echt"-Jewish.</P>
<P>The thought of Robin Williams in the title role raises apprehensions 
of mugging and clowning, yet the actor controls his tendencies quite 
well, although one can never forget that it is Robin Williams up 
there on the screen. Name performers bring in the public but can 
take away much of the verisimilitude.</P>
<P>That's where the use, as characters, of a platoon of Jewish-American 
thespians. comes in--and where the shoe rubs. The "real" or 
near-real Poles of the earlier film have been replaced by a good 
but, in this context, not really convincing cast. Looks, accents, 
mannerisms are askew. There's an impression of "acting" rather than 
"being."  The thespians may, for some viewers, seem insincere or 
near-caricatural.  This was unintened, of course, so I wonder how 
much comes from the film-makers' lack of familiarity with American 
Jews.</P>
<P>The often self-deprecating Jewish humor includes some worn-out 
vaudeville lines like "If you kill yourself, I'll kill you." And 
overall, the film lacks that unbearable look that has been made so 
tragically familiar from documentary footage (much of it by German 
soldiers) or photographs (some amazingly, secretly made by the 
slaves themselves) of ghetto life, especially the Warsaw Ghetto.</P>
<P>I can't remember if, in the original movie, Jakob, as he does here, 
puts on a fake broadcast from London, with sound effects and a 
Winston Churchill imitation. It is inappropriate, silly, not funny. 
And when Jakob speaks to his friends of coded messages of the BBC, 
such as "the baby is in the bath," this is a major goof. The BBC did 
transmit surreal sentences which had a specific meaning for some 
members of the European Resistance, but there's no way that anyone 
in a Polish ghetto would have any idea that such coded sentences 
even existed.</P>
<P>Yet warts and all, Jakob II can, and even should, be seen.</P>
