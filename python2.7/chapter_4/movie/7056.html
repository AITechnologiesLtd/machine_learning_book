<PRE>                              DONNIE BRASCO
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1997 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A hit man for the Mob brings in a new
          recruit and treats him like a father little
          suspecting that the young man is really an
          undercover FBI agent.  Al Pacino turns in a
          memorable performance as sort of a Willy Loman of
          crime, for once playing a low-level hood.  Johnny
          Depp turns in a just-okay performance in the title
          role and is far outclassed.  Much of this film
          seems realistic and the film works surprisingly
          well considering that the director is Mike Newell
          who directed sedate British films like FOUR
          WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL.  Rating: low +2 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     The setting is New York City, 1978.  Lefty Ruggiero (played by Al
Pacino) is one of this country's countless semi-failures, able to get
by just acceptably in a dead end job, but he is never really going be
successful.  Lefty's job is working for the crime syndicate and
especially killing people now and then when the need arises.  He knows
he is well into the second half of his life, has a moderately okay home
life though his son is a drug addict and that bothers him.  His path
crosses that of Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp), a young kid who seems to
have the horse sense that would make him do well in the Syndicate.
Lefty takes Donnie under his wing and helps him to make a name for
himself in the local mob.  Perhaps he sees in Donnie the son he does
not really feel he has at home.  What Lefty does not know is that
Donnie Brasco is really FBI agent Joe Pistone on assignment to go
undercover to collect information about the Organized Crime.  The two
men become close friends and in spite Lefty's having been a murderer
many times over, Donnie learns to like the older man.  Brasco knows
that if he is ever discovered, both he and Lefty will be killed.  At
the same time being Brasco is a full-time job and that means that his
Joe Pistone side must spend most of his life away from his family.
This puts a real strain on his marriage.  There just is not enough of
Joe Pistone to be two people.  The story, which is based on truth,
gives us an inside view of the workings of organized crime and at the
time shows how Joe handles his life that often calls for him to be away
from his family for months at a time.  There are signs that Joe will be
the same sort of failure working for the FBI that Lefty is for the Mob.
On the other hand, Donnie begins to discover that he could have been
fairly successful if he had sincerely gone in for organized crime.
Donnie's feigned drive seems to sell better than Lefty's more sincere
loyalty.</P>
<P>     DONNIE BRASCO is something of a departure for director Mike
Newell.  Newell directed ENCHANTED APRIL, INTO THE WEST, and FOUR
WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL.  Making a film in GOODFELLAS territory is one
of the last things that would have been expected of him.  He gets the
dialog and the feel of the film just about right.  Part of how he does
this is filming on the streets of New York City.  The mentor/student
relationship between Lefty and Brasco and between Joe and the other
agents of the FBI allows the script to explain things reasonably
comfortably and allows the viewer to pick up nuances in the
conversation that would not otherwise be obvious.  Among other things
we learn is about six different, often contradictory, meanings for the
phrase "forget about it."  Under Newell's direction we learn just about
everything that there is to know about the voluble Lefty.  Pacino
rarely stops talking and when he does talk he uses low-class profanity
and candid vocabulary.  On the other hand, Johnny Depp plays his
character as quiet and unemotional so that we are rarely sure what his
is thinking and feeling--at least not from his performance.  It is
Pacino who holds our attention.  But the longer the two men are
together the more of Lefty's behavior and mannerisms Joe seems to pick
up and use even in his personal life.</P>
<P>     This film does give in to some prosaic touches.  Any film about
Italian gangsters seems to need a scene of cooking.  At .least if you
are Italian, what crime does not pay in money it pays in dividends that
show up on your waistline.  That is part of the genre and it has come
to an expected feature of Italian gangster films.  More irritating,
however, are the number of product placements that Newell has put into
his film.  It is not even particularly subtly done.  In the middle of a
dark warehouse neighborhood there will be a big company logo very
obviously placed in the picture.  Deep focus is used in a kitchen scene
so that the viewer can pick up the name on a cereal box.  Later much
the same is done with a scene at an airport in which the camera focus
lets us read clearly the company name on a plane.  If Newell has so
little respect for his own movie that he sells advertising space in it,
it is a lot harder for me as a viewer to respect it.</P>
<P>     The script seems to have been written with the emphasis on Brasco
balancing two very different lives, but in fact Pacino pulls our
attention toward his character and make him more of interest than
Depp's.  Overall I rate DONNIE BRASCO a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
