"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>I don't know if my steady diet of reality television, but Abbas
Kiarostami's The Wind Will Carry Us seems a lot like Big Brother.  The
film plays like there are a bunch of hidden video cameras planted around
a tiny Iranian village.  As a viewer, I almost felt like I didn't belong
there – like a high tech eavesdropper.  It certainly doesn't seem like
anybody in The Wind is acting, as characters routinely turn their backs
to the cameras, uttering nearly inaudible words (thank God for
subtitles) that sound so natural, I doubt they were ever written in a
script.</P>
<P>The Wind takes place in the Siah Dareh, a pueblo-style town built into
the side of a mountain about 450 miles from Tehran.  Siah Dareh is in
the middle of nowhere and, according to one of its inhabitants, it was
purposely built to remain hidden to the world so it wouldn't be stolen.
It's also full of those cute little Gary Coleman-sized doorways.</P>
<P>The film's main character, who we know only as the Engineer (Behzad
Dourani), has brought a small crew of men to the dinky village with a
rather secretive mission, but the crew's assignment isn't the only thing
that Kiarostami keeps hush-hush in The Wind.  We hear the Engineer's
partners talk, but we never see them.  Ditto for a ditch digger that the
Engineer meets when he drives to the outskirts of town each time his
cell phone rings.  There's a dying woman in the town that seems to
figure into the Engineer's work, but we never see her, either.  In fact,
we never learn for sure what the Engineer is doing in Siah Dareh, but he
gives the townsfolk the impression that he's hunting for buried
treasure.</P>
<P>The Engineer befriends a studious young boy, who becomes his guide
through the history and customs of Siah Dareh.  The two share a love of
poetry (the title of the film comes from a poem), and their dialogue
flows so naturally, you'll swear they're making it up as they go along.
Every time the Engineer sees the boy, he asks about the dying woman.
The implication is that the Engineer and his crew are supposed to
document an ancient funeral custom that takes place in Siah Dareh.  But
he could also be the Angel of Death, too.</P>
<P>The main themes of The Wind do seem to concern life and death, but I
have a feeling that the whole film may just be Kiarostami's take on the
present political climate in Iran.  There's just something odd about a
guy digging a hole for what he explains will be part of a new
telecommunication system for a village that barely has electricity.</P>
<P>The Wind is chock full of some of the most beautifully shot landscapes
I've ever seen.  If there was a calendar for the film, I'd be first in
line to buy one.  Kiarostami's uncanny ability to omit large chunks of
the story and still keep the story interesting and understandable is
nothing short of amazing.</P>
<P>1:58 – NR but contains no objectionable material</P>
