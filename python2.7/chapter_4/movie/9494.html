<PRE>Rebecca (1940)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 97 </PRE>
<P>Quiz time: how many Academy Awards for Best Director did
Alfred Hitchcock receive?  Five?  Three?  Actually, none,
although he was nominated on five different occasions.
Well then, how many Oscars for Best Picture did his films
receive?  Only one did, his first American production,
"Rebecca". </P>
<P>"Rebecca" was produced by David O. Selznick, who had just
finished the most successful film ever, "Gone With The Wind".
How much credit for "Rebecca" belongs to Selznick and how
much to Hitchcock is a subject worthy of study.  Certainly
much credit is due to all concerned, since "Rebecca" is one 
of the greatest films ever. </P>
<P>"Rebecca" is about a wealthy man (Lawrence Olivier) who has 
recently lost his stunning wife, the title subject.  He wins
the love of reticent, humble beauty Joan Fontaine.  They go to 
live at his fabulous mansion, run by stern headmistress 
Mrs. Danvers, who is pathologically devoted to the late wife.  
Fontaine lives in the shadow of Rebecca, threatening her marriage.  
Then follows many outstanding plot surprises and twists, which 
I would gladly describe except for the unpleasant email that I 
would then receive. </P>
<P>The cast is outstanding.  Judith Anderson has the role of a 
lifetime playing the foreboding Danvers.  George Sanders plays 
a shady character, and delivers his lines as slyly as ever.  
C. Aubrey Smith is a local constable and is his usual patriachical 
self.  Florence Bates is a delightfully self-important matron. </P>
<P>The script is marvelous, with exchanges like: </P>
<P>"They'd give their eyes to see Monte (Carlo)" 
"That would rather defeat the purpose, wouldn't it?" </P>
<P>A romance, a mystery, suspense, surprises, cast, characters,
cinematography, a story, and script, "Rebecca" has it all 
and may well be Hitchcock's best picture, although 
"Strangers On a Train" is also in the running. </P>
