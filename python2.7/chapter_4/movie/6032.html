<P>     It's a legitimate question to ask why, in the realm of the female 
coming-of-age story, there are far more FOXFIREs than GIRLS TOWNs.  
Sadly, it doesn't take someone with a great deal of insight into 
American culture to figure out the answer.  FOXFIRE is crisply filmed, 
features three pairs of naked breasts, and has a storyline that often 
strays into the realm of the preposterous.  GIRLS TOWN, on the other 
hand, is a gritty, somewhat grainy, look at the realities of growing up 
in America.  There's nothing glamorous about the picture painted by Jim 
McKay's film -- it has the ring of truth, and that's something mass 
audiences seem progressively less interested in.</P>
<P>     The urban high school featured in GIRLS TOWN fits somewhere in 
between that of CLUELESS (where girls obsess about credit cards, makeup, 
and boys) and that of DANGEROUS MINDS (where girls worry about being 
gunned down).  In short, it depicts a setting that is refreshingly 
devoid of Hollywood conventions and cliches.  No one in this film gets 
shot or stabbed.  No one ODs on drugs (except one girl who commits 
suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills).  The violence, which 
is mostly off-screen, tends to be more psychological than physical.</P>
<P>     McKay's GIRLS TOWN proves that a film about three teenage girls 
doesn't have to be exploitative and melodramatic to be dramatically 
viable.  The movie pulls us in simply because the characters are 
interesting, and are worth spending ninety minutes with.  We regard them 
as human beings, not a writer's invention, and this illusion of reality 
is amplified by street-wise dialogue and unforced performances.  GIRLS 
TOWN also has the right look for this type of feature -- the print is 
slightly grainy and the photographic style is very basic (no oddly-
angled shots or rapid-fire edits).</P>
<P>     As GIRLS TOWN opens, we're introduced to four best friends:  Patti 
(Lili Taylor), a "juvenile delinquent" with a baby and an attitude; 
Angela (Bruklin Harris), a would-be poet and writer; Emma (Anna Grace), 
a "good" student bound for Columbia in the fall; and Nikki (Aunjanue 
Ellis), an even better student headed to Princeton.  With their High 
School senior year drawing to a close, the girls are thinking about the 
future, and Nikki doesn't like what she sees.  So, one evening, she 
downs a bottle of sleeping pills and leaves her friends behind feeling 
betrayed and wondering why she did it.</P>
<P>     As a result of Nikki's death, Patti, Angela, and Emma question 
things they formerly took for granted.  They start to fight back against 
life's injustices rather than playing the victim.  Emma avenges a date 
rape by vandalizing the car of the boy who attacked her.  Patti chooses 
an unorthodox method of getting support money from her baby's father.  
And Angela confronts her mother about taking charge of her own life.  
GIRLS TOWN is about female empowerment, but it presents its case without 
rhetoric.</P>
<P>     The script for this film wasn't just written, it was developed as 
part of an improvisational workshop attended by the director and actors 
(the three female leads are given co-screenwriting credit).  This is the 
kind of picture where such improvisation works well.  There's a lot of 
dialogue, and the actors' contributions make it clear that they 
understand their characters.  One scene in particular stands out -- 
early in the film, after Nikki's death, the friends gather to grieve and 
try to understand.  They don't have any answers, but a lot of pain and 
frustration emerges.  It's not the most comfortable sequence to watch, 
but it's very believable.</P>
<P>     Although a few of the supporting players are a little stiff, each 
member of the lead trio gives a fine performance.  While the characters 
have numerous surface differences -- intelligence, skin color, and 
temperament -- they are fundamentally alike.  They use false bravado and 
trash-talking to cover an inherent vulnerability that comes from 
uncertainty about themselves and the future.  From our fly-on-the-wall 
viewpoint, we see the girls not only as their schoolmates see them, but 
as they see each other and themselves.</P>
<P>     GIRLS TOWN does an excellent job of uncovering the angst, pressure, 
and doubt associated with the late teenage years.  Its a refreshing 
film, not only because it shines the spotlight exclusively on girls (all 
the male characters are incidental) but because it does so without a 
whiff of exploitation.  At one point, Patti remarks, "This ain't no 
90210," which is thankfully true.  Instead, GIRLS TOWN is as stark and 
unfeigned as anything that doesn't bear the "documentary" label.</P>
