<PRE>RUN LOLA RUN
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        The choices we make in life, however small, can have a profound
effect on our destiny.  Or, conversely, these choices make no difference at
all--fate has already determined our ultimate course and every zig and zag
along the way.</P>
<P>        No matter to which of these hypotheses you ascribe, Tom Tykwer's
exhilarating "Run Lola Run" reconsiders--and re-executes--the pitfalls,
obstacles, and decisions its central character faces during the longest
twenty minutes of her life.  And it shows, with amazing dexterity and
creativity, how a talented filmmaker can turn a simple storyline into an
elaborate game of "what if...?"</P>
<P>        As the film opens, a frantic Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) is
telephoning his girlfriend, Lola.  Where was she?  He completed the shady
deal involving some hot Mercedes but Lola wasn't there to pick him up as
arranged.  So he wound up walking to the station but accidentally left the
bag of cash on the train.  Now he has only twenty minutes to deliver the
missing 100,000DM to a bald-headed thug called Ronnie or he'll wind up with
a bullet in his head, or worse.  He needs Lola's help.  Fast.</P>
<P>        Lola tells him to keep calm.  She'll be there.  She'll come up with
something.  "Just wait there for me, Manni" she urges.  "Don't do anything
stupid."</P>
<P>        It's 11:40am and Lola starts to run.  She runs from her apartment
and down the stairs (in animated form).  She runs through the ornamental
garden, down the street, across the plaza, over one railway bridge and
under another, past strolling mothers, bicyclists, and nuns, to the German
Transfer Bank where, she hopes, her father will help her out.  Quickly.
But her father is engaged in a serious conversation with an other woman.
Lola's mother, on the other hand, is back in Lola's apartment muttering
something about shampoo and Sagittarius.</P>
<P>        "Do you want to have a baby with me?" asks the woman of Lola's
father in the grainy, close-up style of a sleazy daytime drama.  "Yes."
This is clearly not a good time to be asking her father for favors, so Lola
bolts again.</P>
<P>        The question, of course, is will Lola get to Manni, cash in hand,
before the clock strikes noon?  In "Run Lola Run," the answer is yes, no,
maybe...  Along with the "Rashomon"-styled what-ifs envisioned by Tykwer,
the relatively-unknown director punctuates his film with some inventive
and-thens, as the denizens Lola encounters on her twenty-minute marathon
have their futures economically summarized in snap-happy Polaroid fashion.
Here Tykwer is non-discriminating in his shrewd stabs at sex, religion,
vice, death, and success.</P>
<P>        As Lola, Franka Potente breezes through the film like the Olympic
flame, her burning orange hair flying behind her as if her whole head were
ablaze.  Lola is a commanding figure in the film and an equally persuasive
runner, driven by a pulsating soundtrack (by Tykwer and two of his
collaborators) that matches her pace for pace, and breath for breath.  The
film has wit, style, and adrenaline to spare and its relatively brief 88
minutes are over all too quickly; one wonders what other fanciful scenarios
the fast-witted Tykwer might have conceived.</P>
<P>        In German with English subtitles, "Run Lola Run" plays like a rock
video with substance.  It's superbly edited, visually thrilling at every
turn, and an absolute rush.</P>
