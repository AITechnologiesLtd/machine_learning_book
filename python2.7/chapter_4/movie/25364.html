NATURAL BORN KILLERS
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>There are probably many ways to classify connoisseurs of
modern cinema. One of them is to divide them into two very
distinct camps - those who worship Oliver Stone's 1994 film
NATURAL BORN KILLERS as the ultimate cinematic masterpiece
of its time and those who think of it as nothing more than
celluloid equivalent of an horse manure on hot desert road.
The author of this review usually avoids extreme opinions
and tries to reach middle ground whenever possible. However,
in the case of NATURAL BORN KILLERS such efforts were
fruitless. I was forced to take one of those extreme stands
and I took the latter one.</P>
<P>There are many reasons why my dislike of NATURAL BORN
KILLERS takes dimensions beyond those reserved for usual
Hollywood stinkers. One of them is the fact that Oliver
Stone used all two hours of this film as an opportunity to
show the world that he could master all visual techniques of
filmmaking. This demonstration includes use of both colour
and black-and-white photography, 35mm and Super 8, various
film stock, slow-motion, fast-motion, all possible camera
angles and all possible ways camera can record light.
Unfortunately, rapid editing is also part of this
demonstration and the ultimate impression comes in the form
of nausea for many unfortunate souls who were introduced to
NATURAL BORN KILLERS in theatres (same effect is less
visible among those viewers, who were wise to watch this
film on video, in much safer environment of their own
homes).</P>
<P>Of course, some of Stone's supporters claim that the
aforementioned nausea was the aim of this film. This nausea
was supposed to be the only way for Oliver Stone to deliver
his Message to masses, who would miss it in the hands of
more conventional director. This Message, however, was
supposed to come from the original script by Quentin
Tarantino - dark satire about American media obsession with
crime and violence. Unfortunately, this script came to the
hands of Oliver Stone and two of his co-writers - Danny
Veloz and Richard Rutowsky. Their treatment of Tarantino's
text was probably equal to the way Jack the Ripper had
treated London women, so Tarantino disowned his screenplay.</P>
<P>The protagonists of this film are two outcasts - Mickey Knox
(played by Woody Harrelson) and his girlfriend Mallory
Wilson (played by Juliette Lewis). Starting with Mallory's
abusing father Ed (played by Rodney Dangerfield) two of them
engage in the series of random killings. Since they always
leave a witness after their killing sprees and since they
always take credit for the murders, this pair of serial
killers is turned into media celebrities. They are equally
hounded by psychopathic lawman Jack Scagnetti (played by Tom
Sizemore) and scruples TV show host Wayne Gale (played by
Robert Downey Jr.). Their capture and trial is not the end
of their killing spree nor of media madness - Wayne Gale is
coming to prison, run by sadistic warden Dwight McClusky
(played by Tommy Lee Jones) in order to make exclusive TV
interview with Mickey that would lead to the new cycle of
violence.</P>
<P>If we are to believe Oliver Stone and many of the critics
who hailed this work as masterpiece, NATURAL BORN KILLERS
was supposed to be something like a wake-up call to America,
celluloid protest against media-induced national obsession
with crime and violence, condemnation of the culture that
turns psychopathic killers into heroes of popular culture.
Unfortunately, Stone's film, despite the intentions of the
author, turned into something quite different. Unable to
resist his urges to turn this film into his life-long
personal crusade against Establishment, and lacking any
sense of subtlety, Stone watered down his original
intentions by redirecting his anger and unleashing his
creative demons on too many targets at once - media, law
enforcement, family, society and civilisation in general. In
the end, this film totally misses the point and turns into
the exact thing Stone wanted to criticise - by showing
Mickey and Mallory as heroes, romantic rebels whose loves
transcends traditional morality, Stone glamorises violence,
murder and all the most virulent forms of sociopathic
behaviour.</P>
<P>The last and most sinister aspect of NATURAL BORN KILLERS
revealed itself to the author of this review in real life.
Few years ago I witnessed rather unpleasant scene involving
certain menacing but obviously drugged-out individual who
was trying to intimidate persons around them by publicly
proclaiming his love for NATURAL BORN KILLERS. This little
incident corresponded with series of media reports about
real life acts of violence being inspired by NATURAL BORN
KILLERS (or, to be more precise, their perpetrators trying
to diminish their own responsibility by putting all the
blame on Stone's work). And all those reports, hyped out of
proportions (like Columbine massacre and alleged MATRIX
influence), can serve certain political agendas - agendas
that manifest themselves in strengthened censorship,
suspension of individual rights and other measures that
would increase power of the same institutions Stone tried to
attack in his film. When this happens, failure of NATURAL
BORN KILLERS would be complete.</P>
