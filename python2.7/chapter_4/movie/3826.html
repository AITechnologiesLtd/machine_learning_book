<PRE>Introduction
============</PRE>
<P>     Three boring movies opened in Triangle theaters last weekend.
Sigh.  Perhaps a movie's greatest failure is the failure to
entertain--that single, extraordinary misstep that can never be
recovered.  For once the audience is asleep, the only sound left in the
theater is the surroundsound wail of a fat lady singing somewhere in
the distance....</P>
<PRE>SPECIES
=======</PRE>
<P>     The dopey title credits are a warning not to take things too
seriously, and, sure enough, in the very first scene of this Roger
Donaldson (NO WAY OUT) sci-fi feature, covert government scientist (is
there any other kind?).  Ben Kingsley botches an attempt to gas a little
girl.  She escapes from the lab because somebody left a door open,
and, more importantly, because she's a little monster who was grown
from a DNA sequence received via intergalactic e-mail.  Faster than you
can say, "What the hell were you thinking, Hugh?," Little Miss Dangerous
makes it away from the compound, hops a train to L.A. (where else?),
and transforms into a sexy adult terror (Natasha Henstridge)
overnight.</P>
<P>     Meanwhile, Ghandi is recruiting a team of experts that includes a
sociologist, a biologist, an empath (!), and a "specialist." (The
latter is played by Michael Madsen, not Sylvester Stallone.) They're a
fun lot, and though they don't have a lick of common sense between
them, they bring a unique flavor to a film that's already way too
derivative to begin with.  (Think THE FUGITIVE meets ALIEN.)  Of course,
said novelty quickly wears thin as each character grows more stupid the
longer they stay on-screen.</P>
<P>     Prolonged exposure to this movie apparently affects human brain
cells.</P>
<PRE>Grade: C</PRE>
<PRE>FIRST KNIGHT
============</PRE>
<P>     This one fares better, a bit better, because it's more coherent.
Three writers are credited with this retooling of the Arthurian legend
that plays like a pitch from a Hollywood power-lunch.  Connery as
Arthur!  Ormand as Guinevere!  Gere as Lancelot!  Though quite the tidy
affair under the assured hand of director Jerry Zucker (GHOST), the
film is really as uninspired as the title.  (FIRST KNIGHT?  First in
what??) Most of the mythology has been jettisoned in favor of a chaste
love story with action sequences.  Excalibur?  Merlin?  African
swallows??  Forget it.  This is a polite Camelot where the dashing
hero, Lancelot, is an existential wanderer who's better with a sword
and a horse than ye olde English accent.  Think of Eroll Flynn as Roy
Rogers.</P>
<PRE>Grade: C</PRE>
<PRE>SMOKE
=====</PRE>
<P>     Then there's SMOKE, which unites director Wayne Wang (THE JOY LUCK
CLUB), author Paul Auster ("The Music of Chance"), and a handful of
characters at a Brooklyn cigar shop.  We meet three at the beginning:
store owner Auggie Wrenn (Harvey Keitel), writer/customer Paul Benjamin
(William Hurt), and teen lifesaver Rashid (newcomer Harold Perrineau).
There are other characters, played by other cast members including
Forest Whitaker, Stockard Channing, and Ashley Judd, all of whom lead
interconnected lives with interconnected meanings, and none of which I
paid much attention to while asleep.  The film finally shows a pulse at
the beginning of the second hour, when Ashley Judd makes her appearance
as Wrenn's crackhead daughter.  And that's just about the time that my
date and I decided to leave.  What a drag.</P>
