<PRE>BIG DADDY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Adam Proudly-Rude-And-Obnoxious Sandler is back.  This time he uses his
mean-spirited shtick to teach our kids a series of would-be humorous,
bad lessons.  From how to ridicule poor, minimum wage clerks to how to
cause bodily injury to innocent bystanders, Sandler lays it on thick.</P>
<P>"From now on, you do what you want to do" is the credo he gives to the
5-year-old under his care.  And when Sandler says anything, it means
exactly that.  Do anything you want without any regard to whether it
hurts you or others.  Telling a 5-year-old that life has no limits is
the height of irresponsibility.</P>
<P>The contrived setup has Sonny Koufax (Sandler) adopting Julian (played
by twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse), the recently discovered son of his
roommate (Jon Stewart).  Sonny hopes that this will impress his current
girlfriend, Vanessa (Kristy Swanson).  It doesn't.  By the movie's
schmaltzy ending, it will, however, have won over the heart of his new
love interest, played by Joey Lauren Adams from CHASING AMY.</P>
<P>The movie shamelessly tries to shock you -- from the unexpected, big gay
kiss to the vomit scene so realistic that you can see the exact contents
of Julian's most recent meal.  In a scene that grade-schoolers will no
doubt attempt to emulate, Julian spits up a long, sticky stream of the
contents of his mouth until it touches the ground and then sucks it all
back in.  Sonny beams with admiration as his buddies watch the new trick
that he has taught his son.</P>
<P>The sadistic movie has Sonny showing Julian how to have fun by tripping
speeding rollerbladers with a stick.  Julian, no surprise, will emulate
this and other bad behavior to the detriment of his classmates,
including one whose arm gets broken in the process.  Julian, like his
adoptive father, thinks such anti-social antics are funny.</P>
<P>In the movie's signature comedy routine, Sonny teaches Julian how to
urinate in public.  When Julian has trouble peeing on a restaurant wall,
Sonny pees with him so the kid will be properly motivated.</P>
<P>The movie's most egregious action has Sonny taking Julian for a late
morning breakfast at McDonald's.  When they arrive too late, Sonny
screams obscenities at the friendly but helpless clerk who tells him
that breakfast is no longer available.  If you don't get exactly what
you want in life, when you want it, the movie wants us to feel empowered
to demean those who've had the bad luck to cross our paths.</P>
<P>The humor generally is on the level of laughing about whether Julian can
wipe his own rear.  Some jokes are funny, even if barely.  For a
nightlight for Julian, Sonny pulls out a large neon sign that points to
"Live Nudes."</P>
<P>In a funny joke that went over much better in the faster paced trailers,
Sonny finds out that his girlfriend has dumped him for a 60-year-old
guy.  "He has a 5-year plan," Vanessa gives as the reason she has fallen
for her new beau.  "What is it?" Sonny asks sarcastically.  "Don't die?"</P>
<P>The movie, which celebrates bad behavior, will undoubtedly have
audiences composed largely of 9-14 year olds, as was ours.  The
marketing of the movie is clearly aimed at that group.  The tearjerker
ending tries to eradicate the teachings of the rest of the movie with a
big message that you should call your father up and tell him that you
love him.  It doesn't fly.  It's like a murderer showing up at the
funeral to say how sorry he was that the deceased passed away.  Nice
sentiment, but much too late.</P>
<P>BIG DADDY runs 1:33.  It is rated PG-13 for language and some crude
humor.  The film is acceptable for teenagers but questionable for those
much younger.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 10, loved the film and gave it *** 1/2, saying it
really cracked him up.  Except for the throwing up and spitting, he
liked it all.</P>
