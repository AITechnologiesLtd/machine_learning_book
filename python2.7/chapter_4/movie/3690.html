<PRE>                                     CASPER
                       A film review by Thomas Wheeler
                        Copyright 1995 Thomas Wheeler</PRE>
<P>     I wasn't entirely sure what to expect when I entered the theater
for CASPER.  I'd seen some of the promos, which looked visually
impressive, but Casper had never been one of my favorite comic/cartoon
characters as a kid.  I suppose my main reason for going was to see if
the special effects would prove as impressive as the advertisements
seemed to show them to be.</P>
<P>     They were that and more.  CASPER is yet another victory for the
people (and computers!) at ILM, who in the past few years have brought
us the magnificent visuals of JURASSIC PARK, and the more cartoonish
images of THE FLINTSTONES.  CASPER is a different sort of entity,
appearing at once cartoonish and yet having to function, along with his
three obnoxious uncles, in a comparatively realistic setting.</P>
<P>     One of the prior reviewers mentioned that, after a time, he forgot
he was looking at computer-generated images and accepted them as just
other characters in the film.  So did I, and I tend to be fairly
analytical when it comes to special effects.  Additionally, this movie
should get an Oscar for set design.  Casper's home makes the Addams
Family mansion look like a reject from a trailer park.</P>
<P>     Speaking of the Addams Family, Christina Ricci turns in a
wonderful performance as young Kat, who quickly becomes Casper's close
friend, the first he's ever really had.  She's so charming, and has
such a pleasant smile, it's a shame she never got to do that much in
the Addams' films --!</P>
<P>     This movie impressed me more on just the technical levels,
though.  Although the story is somewhat disjointed in areas, it works
on the level it needs to.  This movie never tries to be deeply
philosophical, intellectual, or, thank God, political.  All it ever
tries to do is entertain, and in that, it succeeded magnificently.</P>
<P>     The climatic scene, with Casper and Kat on the dance floor during
a Halloween party, is one of the most charming scenes I've seen in
movies in a very long time.  Best of all, there is virtually nothing
offensive in this film.  A couple of scenes could be called, at worst,
tasteless.  For anyone looking for a movie that is just plain fun, and
that you can take the kids to, CASPER gets my highest recommendation.</P>
