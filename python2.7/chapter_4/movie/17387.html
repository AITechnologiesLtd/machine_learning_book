<PRE>The Corruptor
* * *
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1999 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>"The Corruptor" is a mixture of Hong Kong arcade-action cinema and Sydney
Pollack-esque New York crime drama, and what's surprising is that the hybrid
seems to work.        It concerns two New York City detectives -- played by Chow
Yun- Fat and Mark Wahlberg (who gets better every time I see him) -- who get
sucked into a complex plot of double-crossings and betrayals.  It's one of
those movies that makes more sense after it's over, but is quite a ride while
it's still unspooling.</P>
<P>Chow Yun-Fat's cop is one of those guys who "frisks" someone by smashing his
face into a brick wall while lifting the guy's cigarettes.  Wahlberg's
detective is more reserved and thoughtful, and has been assigned to Yun-Fat's
department to handle a possible organized-crime connection.  The two don't
like each other very much -- and in fact learn to hate each other's guts
enormously, especially after both of them may turn out to be dirty and on the
take.</P>
<P>And more than that I'm not sure I should give away, since at about the
halfway mark there are a series of revelations which, instead of seeming
tacked-on as gratuitous plot-twists, give everything we've seen before a new
and ominous resonance. (There's even a subplot about the Wahlberg character's
father, which at first seems gratuitous, but soon turns out to be organically
connected to everything.)  The movie, instead of getting dumber, gets smarter
and less beholden to formulas as it goes on.  That's rare.</P>
<P>After the visually-enticing but otherwise shallow "Replacement Killers"
(which I still admired for its bombasticity), Chow Yun-Fat now has his first
English- speaking dramatic role as a New York cop in "The Corruptor".  He
plays the role -- a tough-as-rusty-nails detective -- with all the
eye-rolling, evil-smirking over-the-top-ness that he brought to many of his
more outre' Hong Kong roles. But instead of seeming out of place, he hardly
seems to be able to catch up with the manic pace of the movie he's in: he
seems like a caged animal, trying frantically to chew its way out.  Wahlberg,
cerebral and at times exhausted, comes off as someone who knew exactly what
he was getting into from the moment he stepped on screen -- even if we don't
know what that is.  His performance fills in what we don't know factually by
being emotionally complete.</P>
<P>I was surprised to hear how universally derided "The Corruptor" was.  This is
a good, gritty film that knows its material well, and wraps it in a slick and
entertaining package.  A friend of mine slammed the film as being
"predictable".        Maybe its plot is predictable, but the way we get to the
ending we're expecting doesn't come the way we'd expect.  And if every story
were unpredictable, then fiction as a device would be semipointless: the
point is not to get something you can't anticipate, but to get it in a way
you can't anticipate.</P>
