<PRE>Let My People Go
The Prince of Egypt</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>The Exodus story painted and song into fiery crimson frames and enchanting
hymns; "The Prince of Egypt" delivers with Charleston Heston "Ten
Commandments" strength, the stern story of the Passover. Val Kilmer's voice
breathes Moses to life, Michelle Pfeiffer speaks for the sassy Tzipporah
with Ralph Fiennes bringing the same "faulted-stone" presence of his "Quiz
Show" to the Rameses Character.</P>
<P>I like a movie that grabs me from the get go. Take a vulnerable crying
newborn, put him in a woven basket and send him drifting down a river full
of crocodiles. I'm watching. The melodies to the haunting song "Deliver"
flow with the same grace and enchantment of the oil painted currents under
the baby Moses. This gorgeous somber scene spills into a rushing chariot
race as exciting as the best car chase scenes around.</P>
<P>The movie focuses on the relationship between two brothers Moses and
Rameses -- the love they cannot deny for each other and the chasm of faith,
purpose and mission large enough to part the Red Sea. A fantastic
psychedelic motif of Hieroglyphics are used to "enlighten" Moses of his
heritage as a Hebrew and the horrifying nightmarish truth of the pharaoh
(the man he used to call father). My breath slowed, eyes watered, and a
chill similar to that of the breath of Passover plague crawled up my neck as
Moses realizes his father drowned countless Hebrew babes. In fact, you might
consider leaving your younger ones with a babysitter due to this serious
subject matter.</P>
<P>No one is denying that the parting of the red sea scene from "The Ten
Commandments" is a powerful special effect (especially for it's time). Don't
worry, "Prince of Egypt" tidal waves command that same awe. I believe the
people at DreamWorks put their brushes to the film with the spirit Moses put
his staff in the mighty Nile, lighting it up with the eerie color of
bloodshed. This is a powerful engaging film.</P>
<P>The Prince of Egypt. Animated Feature. Rated PG.
Voices of Val Kilmer, Michelle Pfeiffer and other big names.
Directed by Brenda Chapman.</P>
