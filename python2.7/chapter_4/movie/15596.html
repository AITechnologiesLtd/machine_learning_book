<PRE>Waking Ned Devine
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1998 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4)Except that it's set in a small Irish village, WAKING
NED DEVINE could pass for GRUMPY OLD MEN 3. Instead of Walter Matthau
and Jack Lemmon, it stars two aging Irish actors, Ian Bannen and David
Kelly.</P>
<P>Bannen and Kelly play Jackie and Michael, two old friends who don't act
their age. (The two take motorcycle rides to the icy Atlantic to go
skinny-dipping.) When they learn someone from their village (of just 52
people) has won the lottery, they concoct some wacky schemes to befriend
the winner.</P>
<P>They target the 18 known lotto players from the village and invite them
all over for a nice chicken supper. One by one, they rule everyone out,
until they deduce the winner must have been the man who didn't come, Ned
Devine.  </P>
<P>Jackie trudges up to Devine's house in a storm, carrying a chicken
supper as a bribe... gift. He finds Devine sitting in front of the
telly, the winning ticket clutched in his dead hand. The shock of
winning the lottery must have given old Ned a heart attack.</P>
<P>Jackie and Michael try to claim the ticket for themselves, with Michael
taking Ned's identity. They manage to fool the lotto man on the first
visit, but he informs them he'll have to ask around - make sure Ned's
who he says he is. Now Jackie and Michael have to include the whole town
in the scheme if they want to avoid prison. They won't get their
millions, but it still leaves £130,000 for every person in the village -
if they can pull it off.</P>
<P>The movie's got a (mostly) good heart and more brain than you might
think. Jackie's wife Annie (Fionnula Flanagan) is the movie's loving
moral conscience. She makes the two heroes ponder the fraud they are
committing and the potential wishes of the deceased. If this were truly
a sitcom, such questions could be laughed off with a joke or two. But
the two heroes take the question to heart and consider how they can do
some good with the money.</P>
<P>The movie even remembers to tell us where the money would have gone, had
not Jackie and Michael intervened. After all, the money wouldn't have
vanished into thin air. It would have gone... well, you'll have to see
for yourself.</P>
<P>There is only one time that the movie is unapologetically blackhearted,
and it stands out in contrast to the rest of the film. It's a scene
that's supposed to make you cheer, but it is unnecessarily cruel, and it
calls into question the film's otherwise goodhearted nature. Many
audiences actually did cheer, so you may too. But I found myself wincing
at the films sudden wicked glee.</P>
<P>The film is full of colorful minor characters. There's a pig farmer in
love with the town's flirt. She loves him too but can't stand the smell.
There's a rookie minister who talks to the town's youngest boy, who has
tough and practical questions about God.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, none of the minor characters is developed enough to
really let you get attached. They are quirky, and at times amusing, but
they are on the whole flat and robotic. The fact that the "evil"
villager is dealt with so mercilessly is enough to tell you that Jones
didn't consider his minor characters to be fully human, but rather
offbeat icons of a small town.</P>
<P>WAKING NED DEVINE is no great film. The direction is adequate, if a bit
predictable. The film's timing seems to be just a bit off. The sitcom
aspect to the comedy feels a bit too contrived, as do the moments of
earnest friendship. The widescreen cinematography is good, but
disappointingly mundane given such a photogenic setting (the film was
shot on the rugged and rustic Isle of Man).</P>
<P>On the other hand, I don't think it was striving for greatness. It's
only supposed to be a lightweight, fun comedy. And on that level, it
succeeds pretty well. If you're interested in seeing GRUMPY OLD
IRISHMEN, don't let me stop you. It's not a bad movie, and it certainly
can be entertaining. </P>
<P>Just don't say I sent you.
