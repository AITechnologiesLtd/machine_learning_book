<P>In PAYBACK, Mel Gibson has the role of a surly, hulking badass named
Porter. Porter has a unique disposition: he's the bad guy we know and
hate caught in the main role. Already the red flags are going up in the
marketing department -- audiences'll never go for it; they need someone
more noble to cheer for. And what's this? By the end of the movie,
Porter's *still* a badass! Unacceptable. A successful antihero pic,
GROSSE POINTE BLANK had our hero character come full circle and pick up
some respectable virtues by movie's end. But not Porter. Nope. However,
maybe it *is* Porter's stubborn badassedness that helps save this movie. </P>
<P>PAYBACK needs something to save it, because it doesn't always work.
Porter, essayed in fine form by Gibson, is a master bank robber who
specializes in payroll jobs -- taking large sums of money all at once.
Unfortunately, his partner (Gregg Henry) has double-crossed him, and run
off with Porter's half of their latest score: $70,000. Not only that,
but Porter's girlfriend (Deborah Kara Unger) was in on the double-cross.
So now Porter's got to follow a cold trail back to his money, through a
lethal syndicate of mob heads and crooked cops. </P>
<P>It's when Porter gets on the trail back to his money that the movie runs
cold as well. Here it loses the upbeat tempo which is crucial to the
movie's sucess, and instead of providing snappy, guns-blazing action, it
lulls into unnecessary segments of development. This isn't good
filmmaking, especially when audiences expect to get a thrill ride.
Fortunately, the slower middle portion is bookended by a great opening
sequence and a nice finishing touch. </P>
<P>The finishing touch is loaded with irony, and it's just a sampling of
the script's finer moments. Written by Brian Helgeland, who co-wrote the
award-winning script of L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, it includes a number of comic
moments that get the audience in the proper mood to forgive the movie's
slower moments. Helgeland, who makes his directorial debut here, chooses
to try and spice up these slow parts with excessive blood and gore, but
it largely desensitizes the viewer to Porter's mission. It does not
accomplish its task. </P>
<P>The movie comes in at slightly above average for Mel Gibson's fine
performance in the lead role. He gives a sadistic credibility to Porter,
one that might elude actors of a lesser talent. The supports are all
serviceable, and they're not really asked to do a whole lot in a movie
like this. Largely, the pieces fit together; it's just an odd puzzle to
fit them into, and for this, PAYBACK is a questionable choice. Not to be
seen by the lighthearted movie-goer, it will run its course in the box
office and then reappear as an occasional bachelor party video rental. </P>
