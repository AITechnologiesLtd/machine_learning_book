<PRE>                            THE VANISHING (1993)
                                 [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Nick Jarecki
                        Copyright 1993 Nick Jarecki</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: R - Restricted</PRE>
<P>     What starts out with an intense psychological build-up ends with
a pathetic anti-climax, making you walk away from the movie hating it.</P>
<PRE>                        THIS REVIEW IS A SPOILER!!!</PRE>
<PRE>              If you have not yet seen the movie and plan to,</PRE>
<PRE>                           DO NOT READ THIS!!!</PRE>
<P>     The hero of our story is Jeff, a troubled guy looking for his
girlfriend.  Capably played by Keifer Sutherland, Jeff spends the movie
looking for his girlfriend Dianne, who vanished from a shopping mart
after having an argument with him.  I love Keifer Sutherland and must
say that he does give a performance that really makes the movie hold
together....  However, the writer did not give him an easy time and Keif
has to do a lot of work to make this happen</P>
<P>     The heroine of our story is Rita played by Nancy Travis.  This
women is an extremely good--yet extremely unknown--actress who
essentially makes the movie.  Her character is selfish and somewhat
bitchy however she saves our friend Jeff from his demise by being buried
alive!!!  (I told you SPOILER!)</P>
<P>     The villain is Barney, shittily played by Jeff Bridges.  You go
through the movie hating Barney (not 'cause your supposed to, just
'cause his character is so weak--not to mention the shitty performance
by JB).  He is psychotic and stupid and has a lust for putting peole in
boxes and suffocating them (i.e., Buried Alive!!!).</P>
<P>     The thing that pisses me off about this movie is the ending....
There is a big buildup with Barney saying, "You have to experience
everything that Dianne experienced from this moment forward...."  Oooh!
I thought it would be some intricate little thang....  Instead it's just
being drugged unconscious and being put in a box to die from suffocation.
Barney says this was the worst thing he could imagine.  I can imagine a
lot worse things than that!</P>
