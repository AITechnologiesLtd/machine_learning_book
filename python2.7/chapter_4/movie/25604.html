<PRE>NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * *</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Peter Segal
Written by: Steve Oedekerk, Barry W. Blaustein, David Sheffield, Paul Weitz, 
Chris Weitz</P>
<P>That mountainous family from "The Nutty Professor" has returned. This time 
the brilliant (though still larger than life) Sherman Klump (Eddie Murphy) 
has found the secret to a youth formula, which his boss, Dean Richmond 
(Larry Miller) is selling to a pharmaceutical company for 150 million 
dollars. However, before Sherman can become rich and famous he faces three 
problems: one, he is madly in love with his partner on the project, Denice 
Gains (Janet Jackson); yet he can't ask her to marry him because of his 
second problem, Buddy Love (Eddie Murphy), is still lurking inside Sherman, 
making him say and do things he doesn't mean; and three, the youth formula's 
effects are only temporary. So Sherman and his chief assistant, Jason (John 
Ales), think up a way to eliminate Sherman's first two problems by 
extracting Buddy's remaining DNA. This causes two unfortunate side affects: 
Buddy Love is released into the world again after a freak accident in the 
lab; and Sherman's brain is damaged, causing him to grow dumber by the 
minute.</P>
<P>Now you're probably wondering how my plot summary managed to have no mention 
of Sherman Klump's family. After all, the previews made the film out to be 
nothing but a long series of hilarious dinner table scenes ala the first 
"Nutty Professor" film. We do get one scene more than a little similar to 
the original film's now famous dinner table scene, but while it may be 
fairly amusing this time around, we've seen it all before. The fact that 
most of the humor in "Nutty Professor II" has been recycled can be viewed as 
both a strength and a weakness. You're obviously wondering how recycled 
humor can possibly be a strength, and the answer is quite simple. The old 
humor feels familiar and comfortable. It's also amusing because the humor 
from the original film is sharp and clever (take a very amusing little 
homage to "Cape Fear" for example). A lot of the new humor added is nothing 
but typical year 2000 gross-out humor, which I'm personally getting more 
than a little tired of (the giant hamster scene is a great example of this).</P>
<P>>From the opening credits, where Eddie Murphy's name is the only one 
advertised before the film's title appears, you know exactly who this movie 
belongs to. Janet Jackson ("Poetic Justice"), John Ales ("Spy Hard"), and 
particularly Larry Miller ("The Big Tease") are present only to further 
Murphy's jokes. So how does Murphy fare? Well, quite frankly, it depends on 
the character he's playing at the time. As Sherman Klump - that big, kindly 
blimp, Murphy is just as likeable as he was in the first film. As Buddy 
Love, he doesn't quite pull off the act this time around. In the first film 
Buddy Love was often uproariously funny; in the sequal he just seems to get 
in the way. He doesn't have enough screen time to leave any sort of 
impression, and when he is on screen he spends most of his time sniffing the 
air and going to the bathroom on newspaper (more on that later). His acting 
like a canine is amusing the first couple of times, but when he starts doing 
it for the sixth or seventh time, the routine has worn out its welcome.</P>
<P>As the Klump family, Murphy's comic abilities depend entirely on which 
family member he's playing. Sherman is still the quaint, kindly man he was 
in the first film, but he's treated like garbage this time around, and it 
isn't funny watching him be embarrassed since he's so likeable. Watching 
Sherman make an idiot of himself in front of Denice's parents made me feel 
bad rather than making me laugh. Grandma Klump, on the other hand, is 
uproariously funny. Any scene with her is so hilariously vulgar I sometimes 
couldn't breath I was laughing so hard; yet her screen time is so limited 
these laughing spells were few and far between. Sherman's parents, Mama and 
Papa Klump, don't fare quite so well. There's a moronic little subplot 
involving Papa's inability to, um, pleasure his wife in bed, but it's never 
particularly amusing. Last, we have Sherman's brother, Ernie. Ernie was 
barely seen in the first film and continues this trend in the sequel. This 
is a shame because I could always tell a great comic character was just 
aching to break free (his few lines in the dinner scene are some of the 
best).</P>
<P>Contrary to what I had feared, the gross-out humor in "Nutty Professor II" 
is really quite restrained (of course, I could be saying that just because I 
now compare everything to "Scary Movie" in terms of gross-out humor). While 
the film is loaded with flatulence jokes (come on, what did you expect?), it 
also contains a fair amount of intelligent jokes. However, Buddy Love is not 
involved in any of these intelligent jokes. I said I'd try to explain why he 
was acting like a dog, so here goes. When Sherman extracts Buddy's DNA, the 
vile containing it is knocked off onto an electrical outlet. While lying on 
the ground a dog walks into the room and scratches a hair off onto the pile 
of goop, which gives Buddy's DNA a host to latch on to and recreate him. 
Since he was created using a combination of Sherman's DNA and a dog's, he 
behaves like a dog while looking like a human. I didn't say it made sense, I 
just said I'd try to explain it. "Nutty Professor II" runs far too long at 
110 minutes, and it should have been no longer than 90. I'd recommend it to 
people who adore fart jokes and give the film a rather generous three out of 
five stars.</P>
