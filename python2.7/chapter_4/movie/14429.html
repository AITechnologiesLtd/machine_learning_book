SUPER FEATURES: Deneuve, and a really well told story.</PRE>
<PRE>         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>This complicated story makes one heck of a film, thanks to the two actors
that pretty much carry it.  Between Catherine Deneuve, and Vincent Prez,
this film actually gets exciting.  The matriarch tries to keep a dream
alive, and the other tries to keep the politics moving forward, and as he
says in the end, the innocent go to jail, and the guilty go free... which is
as much as what the film is about as it is a love story that has become
impossible, and a political event on top of it.</P>
<P>Eliane ( Deneuve ) is a farm owner, who has been able to keep the workers
going, and do very well in the process, even if the communist movement is
beginning to get closer and closer to home.  Eventually, it does so, and the
war pretty much ravaged everything, not only the farms, but also the
personal lives of many people.  Camille is an adopted daughter, by Eliane,
and she is set to marry a nice kid that wants to break the bonds of rigidity
and change in his own family. And after an education in Paris, he returns,
to find that he is forced to marry Camille, and to uphold the family name
and aristocratic position.  It doesn't happen.  His stand is anti
establishment, and the communists are providing a better outlook than the
old system.  After the marriage he leaves.</P>
<P>And Camille, in the meantime gets accidentally involved with a French
officer who has been the mother's lover ( one of many she says ) for  some
time, which needless to say creates an impossible situation.</P>
<P>The officer gets reprimanded for his behavior at an upper class  gathering
by getting sent off to a far away outpost.  And the young and determined
Camille takes off after him on foot.  In the meantime the French are
beginning to lose control.  And Camille finally finds her young man, but he
makes a bad judgement and gets his own commanding officer killed in the
process.  The two young lovers leave, and try to survive for a period under
the blessings of a religious group, until their very own situation has
become also tenuous, and he is asked to leave.  Just then he also gets
captured with his own child in tow, and the story now gets serious.  The
child gets adopted by Eliane, and is raised by her in France.</P>
<P>Camille is captured by the communists, and as is her ability, and
determination, she also becomes one of their leaders, mainly  because she is
a heroine for having killed a French officer.</P>
<P>And in the end ( the story is told as a memory by the mother to the young
son, now both in Paris ).... a reminder how love can be both intense and
meaningful, as well as cruel.</P>
<P>It is an excellent film, very well carried out from beginning to end, and
although it is rather slow in parts, it only adds to the need to see it
resolved.</P>
<P>While the film steers away from the political opinions, it does make a point
of showing that it was the expensive attitudes of the colonialists, much
similar to the style of the older feudal, and religious, system that caused
the whole country to collapse, not necessarily the invading communists.  It
is evident in the film that the megalomaniac attitudes of the upper, and
ruling, classes is the real problem.  And that the new system is promising
an end to those regimes, which many are getting tired of.  In one scene a
group of farmers is destroying a whole family and their belongings by taking
back the land they deserve, rather than be owned by others.</P>
<P>It is a film that fits in the mold of THE LOVER, where a similar situation
also exists, but the process, or strength of the past still dominates.  Here
that structure is really seen to fall.... be it westernized or otherwise.
But the most important of the mercenaries
is the only one that has it all clear... while he has not enough  passion in
his body to be appreciated and loved by Eliane, he at  least has a better
command of his feelings, when he knows that  there is not much left to do,
but go home.</P>
<P>Excellent film, and really quite worth the nomination which Catherine
Deneuve received for the Oscar, and it is a shame that she did not get it,
in a very competitive year.  This film does deserves better fate than be a
forgotten exercise in film making.</P>
