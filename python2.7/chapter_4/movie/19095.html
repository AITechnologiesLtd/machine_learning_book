<PRE>"An Affair to Remember"</PRE>
<PRE>Reviewed by Heather Picker</PRE>
<P>     Directed by Leo McCarey. Written by Delmar Daves and Leo McCarey. Starring
Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr, with Richard Denning and Cathleen Nesbitt. 1957,
115 min., Not Rated.</P>
<P>     In 1939, Leo McCarey (The Bells of St. Mary's, Going My Way) directed
"Love Affair," starring Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne. The film was a critical
success, and McCarey won two Academy Awards for it (direction and writing). For
some reason or another, he decided to remake the film in 1957. Although its
predecessor is widely considered to be the superior film, at the time, "An
Affair to Remember" won over audiences again. The film went on to be nominated
for four Academy Awards.</P>
<P>     "An Affair to Remember" opens with news segments from different parts of
the world, all announcing the engagement of Nickie "The Big Dame Hunter"
Ferrante (Cary Grant) to Lois Clark, a member of a family that is industrial
'royalty,' who is worth an estimated 600 million dollars. Nickie is on a cruise
from Paris to New York, and along the way meets Terry McKay (Deborah Kerr), a
former nightclub singer who was swept away from her former life by her
businessman boyfriend, Kenneth (Richard Denning), and is now focusing on
learning the kind of skills that will be necessary when she becomes his wife.
Of course, Nickie and Terry fall in love.</P>
<P>     A photographer stalks about the ship, secretly snapping photos of the
pair, who are resisting, without denying, their growing attraction. Nickie is a
well-known playboy, and Terry, who is reticent to acknowledge just why she
distrusts him (or rather, herself around him) agrees to accompany him on shore
one day, when he goes to visit his grandmother (Cathleen Nesbitt). They spend
the day together and get along well, and the tension between Nickie and Terry
is obvious. Grandmother Janou, when proposing a toast, instead of toasting
Nick's impending marriage to Lois, looks fondly at Nick and Terry, glasses
raised, and says, "May your voyage home be a pleasant one."</P>
<P>     Returning to the ship, they finally relent, and, in one of the most famous
proposals in cinematic history, decide that in six months they will meet at the
top of the Empire State Building. During this time, they will get their acts
together and decide what they want. If they both show up, they will be married.</P>
<P>     The first part of the movie, carried by Grant's comedic charms and Kerr's
engaging performance, sets a nice pace for the rest of the film, although the
final twenty minutes or so are overwrought enough to almost undo the promising
beginning. I found certain camera angles discerning, as the cinematography was
commended at the time of the film's initial release. The unsteadiness of the
sea and boat shots, giving the effect of the unevenness and rocking of the
waves, was a nice touch the first time, but unnecessary after that.</P>
<P>     Also, the chemistry between Grant and Kerr isn't as magnetic as that of
say, Grant and Katharine Hepburn, or Grant and Ingrid Bergman. Still, it works
out nicely. His blend of suavity and Kerr's graceful uncertainty lend
themselves to many clever shipboard shots (i.e., when she is on the stairs and
he is walking in circles around the staircase; the night at the dining hall
when they are unwittingly sitting in back-to-back booths) with the kind of
outcome that is rarely seen in films outside of that time in Hollywood. An
element of dated, saccharine-soaked implausibility is thrown into the mix when
Terry takes a position as a music teacher at a parochial school. Children sing
twice when once would have more than sufficed. This is a minor flaw, and given
its genre, can be taken in stride.</P>
<P>     The first time I saw this movie, I thought it dragged on for a bit too
long. Since then, I have seen it a couple more times, and I grow more fond of
the film each time I watch it. For example, when Terry returns from the cruise
and Kenneth arrives as she was trying to watch a television interview with
Nickie and Lois. This scene was one that I didn't originally like, but it has
since become one of my favorite scenes in the picture.  Some of the corny
lines, however, like anything that little kid who was stuck, upside down, on
the stair railing of the ship, said.</P>
<P>     Leo McCarey, who had directed Grant (opposite Irene Dunne) in the 1937
screwball comedy classic, "The Awful Truth," has some genuinely great shots in
this movie. Grant and Kerr, who would re-team in Stanley Donen's 1960 comedy
"The Grass is Greener," are up to their expected levels of greatness. Richard
Denning is competent as erstwhile Kenneth and Cathleen Nesbitt gives an
excellent supporting performance as Grandmother Janou. All of this adds up to a
romantic classic.</P>
<P>     Notes: Remade in 1994 as "Love Affair." Currently not available on DVD,
but the video is priced at under $10.  Not rated; kids might get bored after a
while, but there is nothing objectionable in it.</P>
<P>     The Verdict: Check out the 1939 "Love Affair" it is a remake of, but give
"An Affair to Remember" a try. You may not find it to be the tearjerker many
remember it as, but it is an unbeatable combination of lighthearted romantic
comedy and melodrama that will strike a chord with most audiences.</P>
