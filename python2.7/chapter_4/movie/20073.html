<P>              "Halloween: H20" is the seventh in the endless "Halloween" series
and, although it is superior to the last few sequels, it is also surprisingly
bland, unscary, emotionally defunct, and unrewarding. </P>
<P>"Halloween H20" finally brings back Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode, who last
fought and screamed her way through Michael Myers' path at the end of
"Halloween II." Now it's twenty years later, and guess what day it is. Laurie
is now twenty years older and has been in hiding as Keri Tate, the headmistress
of a prestigious private high school where her son attends! Keri is still
having nightmares about Myers, drinks Vodka by the gallon, and confides in her
love interest, a psychiatrist (Adam Arkin of "Chicago Hope"), about her hellish
past. But, what do you know, Michael has tracked her down, courtesy of a nurse
who knew Laurie from the old days in an uninventive opening sequence. </P>
<P>"Halloween H20" is fun for a short while, and it is a pleasure to see Janet
Leigh in a largely brief cameo as Norma (!) who provides a maternal shoulder
for Laurie (sorry, Keri) and drives the same sedan she drove in "Psycho" - it's
a post-modernist "Scream" twist and the only witty idea in the entire movie.
But instead of creating a scenario of suspense where Keri tries to fend off not
only Michael but her own personal demons, the movie opts for blood-soaked,
stupid thrills by having some emaciated, hormonal teens go through the clichéd
motions of your average slasher flick. The kids say, "Who's there?", and the
incompetent direction by Steve Miner ("Friday the 13th Part 2") allows us to
see Michael in the shadows too soon before he walks up to the victims
and...well, you get the idea. Let's not kid ourselves: the two "Scream" movies
and the original "Halloween" went through the same motions but with, oh so much
more atmosphere, finesse, suspense and humor. </P>
<P>There are two tense sequences that stand out: one involves an anonymous mother
and her daughter at a rural rest stop where Michael lurks behind bathroom
walls; and the coup de resistance moment where Michael and Laurie finally meet
face to face through a window. It's a moment of pure shock and horror, exactly
what should have been there throughout the whole movie.</P>
<P>Beyond that, "Halloween H20" has no real scares, surprises or suspense, but it
does have the enormous dignity of Jamie Lee Curtis. Her scenes with her teenage
son and with Arkin are pleasurable to watch and a bit of a novelty in a
disreputable genre. Curtis brings pathos, tears and toughness to her role that
Neve Campbell and Jennifer Love-Hewitt will never quite muster. She almost
singlehandedly saves this mediocre, run-of-the-mill sequel.</P>
<P>Footnote for the curious: The post-"Halloween" movies and rip-offs offered the
idea that a virginal teenager had a better chance of surviving a killer's
throes than those who had unruly sex. Laurie Strode was virginal in the first
two "Halloweens'" but now she has a son through the miracle of...sexual
intercourse. Is Laurie's son the reason Michael Myers is after her?</P>
