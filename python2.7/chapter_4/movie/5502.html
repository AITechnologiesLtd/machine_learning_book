                       A film review by Andrew Hicks

<PRE>PSYCHO</PRE>
<PRE>(1960) **** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        No movie critic worth his fat wouldn't give this Alfred 
Hitchcock masterpiece a four-star rating. I appreciated it even more 
after seeing the three sequels (look down for reviews of those). I 
just wish I hadn't known every little secret of this movie's plot before 
seeing it. I can only imagine how much I would have liked PSYCHO 
without knowing beforehand the details about Norman Bates and 
his mother.</P>
<P>        And if you haven't seen PSYCHO yet, forget about being 
surprised when you find out Norman's been dressing up as his dead 
mother and committing the murders himself. Hey, someone ruins it 
for me, I ruin it for someone else.</P>
<P>        The set-up: A beautiful (by 1960 standards) secretary is 
entrusted with taking $40,000 to the bank. She bypasses the bank 
and heads home instead, where she packs and skips town. The guilt 
gets to her, though, and when night falls, she makes one final (fatal) 
mistake--checking into the Bates Motel. Shoot, even I wouldn't 
check into a motel with an outdoor sign reading "Color TV, Heated 
Pool, Round-the-Clock Stabbings."</P>
<P>        Norman's mom is a little jealous of this beautiful woman 
stealing Norman's attention, so once she hits the shower, mama 
comes down with a kife and... well, wouldn't want to give _too_ 
much away. Needless to say, the shower scene is one of the most 
memorable in cinematic history, even more memorable than the fat, 
vomiting guy in MONTY PYTHON'S THE MEANING OF LIFE.</P>
<P>And don't forget the three lackluster sequels...</P>
<P>PSYCHO II (1983) **1/2
        That psycho Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) is back 
again, fresh out of the asylum in this, the first of three sequels to 
the 1960 Hitchcock classic. Bates is given a job in a diner as the 
cook's assistant (You've gotta be crazy to work in a diner!), where 
he meets an attractive young waitress with no place to stay. Say, I 
do believe I can recommend a place. Why not the Bates Motel? Yes, 
Norman takes the girl back to his old digs, but changes his mind 
when he finds the manager has turned the Bates into a dive for 
fornicating druggies. Norman protests, saying he won't stand for 
such immorality. Why, he remembers the good old days, when the 
Bates Motel was a place for peeping toms to watch women taking 
showers and later stab them to death.</P>
<P>        After firing the manager, Norman and the waitress head 
up to the ramshackle Bates mansion, which now has no trace of 
"mother." Norman tries hard to be sane, but how can he when he 
keeps getting notes and phone calls from mommy dearest? As the 
girl stays a few more nights (they're platonically shacked-up, you 
might say), Norman begins to relapse. Soon, the old hotel manager 
turns up dead and guess who they point the finger at. The man 
dressed up as an old woman carrying on both sides of a 
conversation with his mother? No, the waitress.</P>
<P>        PSYCHO II is by no means on the same level as the 
original (God rest its soul), but it's better than most horror movies 
with a Roman numeral II in the title, including the second Friday 
the 13th, Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, 
Nightmare on Elm Street and CHILD'S PLAY movies. 
Still, Norman Bates has to be the wimpiest horror movie killer 
ever.</P>
<P>PSYCHO III (1986) *1/2
        What's that sound I hear? Oh, that's just Alfred Hitchcock 
turning over in his grave. Yes, Norman Bates is up to his old (yawn) 
tricks again. He's been exonerated for all that went on in the second 
PSYCHO and is trying to make an honest living in the motel 
business. But he's set off again by a woman, this time a guilty 
ex-nun (the best-looking nun I've ever seen) who bears a striking 
resemblance to Norman's first shower victim from the original 
PSYCHO.</P>
<P>        Also along for the ride this time are Norman's rude new 
assistant manager, a reporter digging up history on Bates and a 
group of partying co-eds (no 80's horror movie would be complete 
without them). As with any horror movie series, the PSYCHO films 
have outlived their usefulness. There's only so long we can watch a 
man dress up as his mother and carve people up with a butcher knife 
before we get bored.</P>
<P>PSYCHO IV: THE BEGINNING (1990) **1/2
        This one, a low-budget made-for-TV effort, is actually an 
improvement over the strictly blood-and-guts mentality of the third 
movie. Part IV provides an origin for Norman Bates (Anthony 
Perkins), with most of the movie centered around Bates' call to a 
radio talk show (yes, there still is such a thing as a radio show), the 
subject, of course, being men who have killed their mothers (and, 
naturally, bad sequels to classic movies).</P>
<P>        Through flashbacks we learn Norman's mother was kind of 
weird, not to mention overbearing, with little Norman. Though the 
relationship was never sexual (There is a part where Mrs. Bates 
makes Norman take off his clothes and get in bed with her... but that 
doesn't mean anything), there was an abnormal level of affection 
with those two, so when Mother brings home a boyfriend and heads 
straight for the motel room with the peephole, young Norman 
decides something has to be done -- and fast.</P>
<P>        Hey there, Norm, you can't solve all of life's problems with 
sharp knives. There are also machine guns and hand grenades to 
think about.</P>
