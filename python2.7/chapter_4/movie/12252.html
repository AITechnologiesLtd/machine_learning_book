<P>This film was received very poorly at the time of its release, but
doesn't have much for which to be ashamed, in my humble opinion.
McTiernan, of DIE HARD (8/10) and PREDATOR (8/10) fame, and
Schwarzenegger from the TOTAL RECALL (8/10) and TERMINATOR (8/10)
films, have teamed up to create a fun and enjoyable movie for young and
old.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Young movie geek (O'Brien) receives a magical movie ticket that
mysteriously transports him into the cinematic world of action-star
Jack Slater (Schwarzenegger). Fun ensues as he tries to convince Slater
that he's really "in a movie", dodge all kinds of bad guys, and return
back to his native New York. </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Fun, enjoyable, action-packed, humorous ride through the world of
movies, action heroes and the fine line that rests between fantasy and
reality. This movie is a joy to watch, always keeping you entertained
with exaggerated action sequences, inside jokes, dozens of cameos by
other movie stars (don't bat an eye or you might miss Robert Patrick in
his full police uniform from TERMINATOR 2 (8/10) or Sharon Stone as
Catherine Tramell from BASIC INSTINCT (8/10)), and a semi-coherent plot
that keeps spilling slick action scenes all over this trigger-happy
movie. </P>
<P>Schwarzenegger plays his role as it is supposed to be played (a movie
character that can't believe that he's in a movie), and even shows up
as a cameo himself, as Arnold Schwarzenegger (one of the funniest
scenes is when the real Maria Schriver (wife of Arnold) scolds the real
Arnold about over-promoting his Planet Hollywood restaurant at movie
premieres, at the movie premiere of Jack Slater 4). The little kid is
decent, and the bad guys are your obvious hyperbolized nemeses, but
that's okay, because this movie is a complete send-up of all action
films, and if you don't "get the joke", than you'll probably not enjoy
the film very much (also, if you don't like action...skip this film!).
The soundtrack is constantly pumping you up, the action sequences are
extremely well shot, and there are no boring parts in the entire film. </P>
<P>On the down side, the movie does run a little too long, there are one
too many explosions, and some people may not follow the entire plot
line that has some of the characters moving from one dimension to
another (I had no problem with this), but hey, no movie's perfect
right? Overall, this movie is a great nacho-munching extravaganza,
filled with superb action scenes, a bunch of cool cameos, and a
super-tough-guy action star that does the job to the best of his
ability. Fun stuff !! </P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
Young O'Brien's Christian parents objected to all the foul language
used in the script, and asked that they be removed from the script. 
This film contains intentional continuity errors.
The schoolteacher who praises Laurence Olivier's performance was played
by Joan Plowright, who is Olivier's widow.
The video CHRISTMAS IN CONNECTICUT (directed by Schwarzenegger) is
visible in the video store. </P>
