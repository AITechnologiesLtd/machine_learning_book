<P>A family picture, though not in the usual sense, since it is about 
the darker side of families. It is the fruit of three cooperating 
brothers from Chicago: first-time writer-director Paul; actor Aidan ; 
cinematographer Declan. They were also the executive co-producers. 
And if you look at the credits with a lynx-eye you may note that 
their sister Marian has a tiny role. No sibling rivalry here.</P>
<P>I read that Paul "briefly attended the University of  Illinois , 
where he studied film and writing," but soon quit to travel around 
Europe. He lived in Ireland for six months. Back in Chicago, he 
formed (with Jeremy Piven and John Cusack) a theater company.</P>
<P>Declan went to Chicago's Columbia College, lived and worked for years 
in Ireland. Returning to the USA he photographed several films: the 
much neglected The Ballad of Little Jo, Leaving Las Vegas, Kama 
Sutra, Louis Malle's last movie, Vanya on 42nd Street, and others.</P>
<P>This Is My Father is a curious mix of professional production, a 
heartfelt subject with good intentions, gauche development and 
continuity, and rather muddled relationships. It does have a cast of 
performers who are on my list of very good as well as most likable 
thespians.</P>
<P>James Caan, whose career has been sadly spotty since about the 1980s, 
opens the movie as Kieran Johnson --a present-day high school History 
teacher in Aurora, Illinois-- in a classroom  sequence which is 
economical and right on target. He is a disabused professional among 
too many who-gives-a-damn students whose future, he tells them 
without mincing words, is unpromising.</P>
<P>His home life is not uplifting either.  His very old, widowed mother, 
Fiona, is totally incapacitated by a stroke. Living with them is 
Betty, his divorced sister Betty, and her  rebellious teenage boy 
Jack who's been expelled from school. Kieran himself, the stepson of 
Fiona's late husband, was told that his birth father was a French 
sailor.</P>
<P>The discovery of a fading photo of Fiona and a stranger, whose 
love-message as well as a book of poems were signed "Kieran," incite 
the schoolteacher to find out about his origins.  Since it is 
summer-vacation time, he takes off for Ireland, with his nephew Jack.</P>
<P>The search leads to a small Irish village. Kieran learns nothing from 
the close-mouthed locals.  But then, at their bed-and-breakfast, run 
by Seamus and his aged mother (tinkers who have settled down), the 
old lady, first by having her "palm crossed with gold," then gratis, 
tells the Irish-American the story of star-crossed lovers Fiona and 
farmer  Kieran O'Day (Aidan Quinn).</P>
<P>That sad, beautiful tale takes place in 1939. Fiona is 17, lovely, 
independent, spirited. Kieran is several years older. The girl has 
been sent home by the nuns of her school. Home means  Mother, whom 
all call "the widow Flynn" and who is the richest person in the 
village, owns it sole automobile, has a terrible character, is 
authoritarian, and a lush to boot.</P>
<P>Kieran lives with, and works for his foster parents ,tenant farmers 
for the widow. His lowly origins make him what we'd called today 
"disrespected" by the narrow-minded majority of villagers.</P>
<P>The Fiona-Kieran relationship is revealed to us and to the Chicago 
Kieran in successive episodes, with the time frames alternating 
between 1939 and the present. I will not reveal the plot's evolution 
here. No doubt it holds one's attention. Yet that attention is 
needlessly distracted by the film's structure, certain details and 
the lack of others, so that the story proper becomes slow.</P>
<P>For one thing, relationships can be muddled. Certain characters' 
nature or backgrounds (e.g. the widow Flynn's) have to be inferred. 
What makes her so nasty? There are gratuitous sections or portrayals. 
There's an unexplained store-keeper who covets the widow. Landlord 
Colm Meany starts out with small but  unmistakable gay mannerisms, 
but soon these get dropped.  In a silly episode, Yank photo-reporter 
John Cusack who's just learned how to fly, drops in out of the sky, 
close to the couple that's stranded at , the beach by a malfunction 
of the widow's car. A hyperkinetic fellow, the journalist  wants to 
play American football right away, and does.  He also fixes the car. 
Later he and his tiny plane are gone. If this was meant to be 
semi-comic relief, or to underline American vigor, or else a kind of 
childishness, it was a misguided, jarring interlude.</P>
<P>The village priest, a major figure, is played by Stephen Rae as 
meddling, autocratic, fanatically prejudiced, fire and 
brimstone-preaching, and clearly lecherous. Is this going to extremes 
necessary? The same question applies to the presence of young Jack 
who is quite nice and makes friends with two giggly schoolgirls. But 
the  youth scenes, though pleasant are extraneous to the plot.</P>
<P>Harder to swallow --and found in many a movie--is unfounded 
omniscience. The old woman who relates the past (1939)  knows too 
many details and specifics which she could not possibly have 
witnessed. She's like the eye of God --which counters the good 
photography that has nary a close-up (at most medium close-ups) and 
uses medium and long shots which cleverly distance us.</P>
<P>All the performers are fine, in spite of the sketchiness of most 
roles. Good as well as strong is the depiction of the village as a 
suffocating place. As someone says "in small villages a small 
difference makes a big suspicion."</P>
<P>There have been thousands of Irish or Irish-American roles in cinema. 
There have been   quite a few Irish-themed movies, whether made in 
Hollywood, the U.K., and now in Ireland too. But how many of them do 
American audiences know or remember?</P>
<P>Several of those films were political dramas, such as the grim 
classics The Informer (1935) and Odd Man Out (1947). Most of the 
modern ones deal with Northern Ireland: Cal (84), Hidden Agenda (90), 
In the Name of the Father (93). There have been socially conscious 
items, some sad, others upbeat, others mixed: Ryan's Daughter (70), 
The Field (90),  The Commitments (91), The Playboys (92) (with Aidan 
Quinn), Raining Stones (93), The General (98, starring Brendan 
Gleeson as the real-life gangster) ). There have been few outright 
romances, like Circle of Friends (95); or  comedies, like the warm, 
realistically colorful The Snapper (93, starring Colm Meany); and 
probably just one major poetic legend, The Secret of  Roan Inish 
(95). Yet the one title that would be most familiar to most viewers 
would be John Ford's picturesque The Quiet Man (52, starring John 
Wayne).</P>
<P>This is My Father joins the group of grim Irish-centered movies, and, 
whatever its weaknesses, deserves praise for its honest 
,non-commercial avoidance of picturesque or cliched or true or false 
Irishisms. It may not be a film after the Irish Travel Bureau's 
heart, but then this is its principal orginality.</P>
<P>The Irish Republic and Ulster cannot compete with the multitude of 
genre movies, such as Westerns, yet the  overwhelming majority of the 
above titles are gems.  In any case, comparisons would be pointless. 
It's like the elephant mocking the mouse "Look at the size of me, and 
look at the size of you.""Yeah" retorts the mouse "...but I've been 
sick!"</P>
<P>" Le mauvais gout mene au crime" (Stendhal)</P>
