<PRE>                           THE GODFATHER PART III
                            [Spoilers included.]
                       A film review by Peter Reiher
                        Copyright 1991 Peter Reiher</PRE>
<P>     I finally got around to seeing THE GODFATHER PART III, and I'm not
happy.  It's is much, much worse than the first two films.  And "worse"
is the term, not "not as good."  I thought the first two films were
brilliant, while the third is easily the worst film Coppola has ever
made, even counting that trivial little segment of NEW YORK STORIES.
The only good points of this film, in my opinion, were Andy Garcia's
dynamic performance, good production design, and an acceptable
performance from Pacino.</P>
<P>     The flaws, on the other hand, are legion, starting, as bad films
invariably do, with the script.  THE GODFATHER PART III is not nearly as
well written as the first two films.  The dialog is weaker, the story is
not well integrated into the world built in the first two films, some of
the characters are inconsistently written, few of them are very
interesting.  Some characters only seem present because they were in the
other films, notably Kay, Diane Keaton's character.  </P>
<P>     One very serious problem in the script is that we do not get enough
explanation of why Michael isn't the man he was at the end of the last
film.  Hints, yes, but not a real explanation.  Since the whole series
is more about him than anyone else, that's a major flaw.  More or less
the last thing we see in THE GODFATHER PART II is Michael contemplating
the murder of his brother, and coming to terms with it by banishing all
his feelings.  In this film, his son tells him that he is leaving law
school to become a singer, and Michael gives the same song and dance
that a stockbroker would give his son in the same circumstances.  There
is no trace of the powerful, amoral man who would do anything to get his
way in this scene.  Where'd he go?  Either Michael should continue to
behave in the same way, or we must be told what caused him to change.
In this film, Kay tells Michael that she thinks he's more  dangerous
than ever now that he's respectable.  Why?  He seems far less dangerous
in this film.  Is Kay supposed to be wrong?  Is it supposed to be a
foreshadowing of an explosion of violence and evil from Michael?  There
is no support for either of these possibilities, or any other that I can
see, except, perhaps, that Coppola and Puzo thought it was a good line.</P>
<P>     The script is also lacking in the atmosphere and strongly written
scenes that were so much a part of the earlier films.  The opera
sequence at the end of the film is an inferior retread of the climax to
THE COTTON CLUB.  There is no scene in this film equal (in its writing)
to the scene in THE GODFATHER PART II where Hagen explains to one of the
family's betrayers why he must commit suicide, or the scene where
Michael tells his brother that he knows of his betrayal, or the scene in
Part I where the Godfather dispenses favors at his daughter's wedding.
The script also provided too little material for us to get any feel for
the world of the Mafia, as the first two scripts did so  well.  It
didn't substitute any feel for the world of high finance, or the
Vatican, either.</P>
<P>     Talia Shire's character is especially harmed by this failure of
background.  She is forever going on about "saving the family."  What
family?  There's Pacino, Garcia, Pacino's two children, herself, and
about three underlings.  Pacino's kids don't want to have anything to do
with the Mafia, so who are they saving the family for?  Contrast this to
the first film, in which Brando was surrounded by sons, cousins, and
retainers -- in a true, if perverse, sense, he was a feudal lord who
watched out for all of the peasants in his barony.  In this film, Pacino
is a businessman with only a shell of a company.</P>
<P>     The acting is surprisingly poor.  As mentioned, Andy Garcia is
dynamic and alive, and Pacino is fine, given the scripted limitations.
But the rest of the cast contains hardly a decent performance, much less
a brilliant one.  Eli Wallach left tooth marks all over the scenery.
Joe Mantegna gave the first bad performance I've ever seen from him.
(He was, admittedly, hampered by some of the script's poorest lines.)
George Hamilton had nothing to do and did it drably.  Talia Shire
careened between different interpretations of her character which mostly
didn't fit in with what we already know of her from the  earlier films.
There isn't a single bad performance in either of the first two films,
and there are several in this one.  Disturbingly, the minor characters,
who seemed so flavorful in the first two films, dissolve into
indistinguishable mush in this film -- a combined flaw in writing and
casting.  As far as Sofia Coppola goes, well, let's just say I
considered the climax of the opera scene to be a happy ending.</P>
<P>     In addition to problems of script and acting, THE GODFATHER PART
III is perhaps the worst edited major film I've seen in many years,
probably a result of the rush job necessary to meet the December 25th
deadline.  THE GODFATHER PART III is choppy.  Scenes do not flow
naturally together.  Coppola intercuts between simultaneous action
without rhyme or reason.  A notable example -- the scene in which Andy
Garcia is playing pool and is interrupted by Talia Shire.  This scene is
unnecessarily cut in half by a sequence in which Michael Corleone 
masquerades as Kay's driver so he can show her Sicily.  Why the cut?
Well, Garcia has a reaction to the car starting up and driving away,
and, unless the other scene is interposed, the reaction makes no sense.
However, the interruption robs Garcia's scene of the power it needs.
With sufficient time, I'm sure the editors could have worked around the
problem, possibly cutting Garcia's reaction and placing the scene
between Michael and Kay elsewhere.  That's the sort of thing that
happens when you have a rush job.  There are other examples, as well.</P>
<P>     A more serious flaw is the frequent use of fades to black.  At
least four or five times, a scene ends, we fade to black, and we are
somewhere else dealing with entirely different thematic material.  These
fades cause the rhythm of the film to stop dead.  Using a fade to black
as a period at the end of a cinematic sentence is a perfectly valid
technique, if you really do want to pause and indicate that a major
change is about to take place, but that isn't what the makers of this
film seem to have in mind.  Rather, they need to end one scene and start
another, and they didn't have time to do anything good, so they faded to
black.  Whenever they do, any momentum the film has built disappears,
and they do it quite a lot.</P>
<P>     The music for this film, another strong point in the earlier films,
is terrible.  Coppola's hiring his father to do the score was an even
worse idea than hiring his daughter to play a leading role.  The only
decent parts of the score are those written by Nino Rota for the first
film.  Much of the rest of the music is banal, and sometimes
inappropriate.</P>
<P>     And even the direction is poor.  I mean, really, a spinning
newspaper stopping to reveal a headline?  Followed by a shot of
newspapers coming off the presses so we could see another headline?
These were cliches in the 1940's.  Relying on them to provide us with
information is almost cynically lazy.  I never thought Coppola would try
to use this kind of technique seriously.  This one is so old that it
isn't even any use for a joke.</P>
<P>     Coppola also seems to have lost his eye for shots.  I liked very
much a shot showing Raf Vallone and Pacino separated by an urn, during
Pacino's confession.  It nicely commented on the content of the scene,
with the physical separation between the calm, peaceful cardinal and the
suffering, troubled Mafioso.  But that is the only memorable scene,
other than, possible, dropping one of the murder victims down a
stairwell and the opening sequence in which the camera travels over the
wreckage of the Corleone's vacation house by the lake.  That very
promising opening suggests that we will see the corresponding moral ruin
of the man who owns the house.  But we don't.  Instead, we get a kinder,
gentler Michael Corleone who, for reasons unclear from anything we've
seen in the earlier films, decides he wants to get out of the crime
business.  </P>
<P>     The laziness of the direction is also clear in all of the film's
other flaws, including the acting and the editing.  Particularly
ludicrous is the scene at the very end, in which the aged Michael dies
in his chair in a long shot.  He drops the orange, slumps over, he's
dead -- so far, so good.  Then he falls out of the chair.  I was
reminded of the guy on LAUGH IN who used to ride around on a tricycle
and then fall over sideways.  Not very subtle, Coppola.</P>
<P>     The photography isn't bad, but lacks the rich texture of the first
two films.  Shadows played a much more important role in those films.
Here, not very much happens in shadow.  The light isn't as golden,
perhaps appropriate for a film with a more modern setting, but
definitely not as pretty.</P>
<P>     The production design is as luxurious as ever, and cannot be
faulted.  It's nice, I guess, that someone in the production is doing
his job.</P>
<P>     Overall, I'm not sure whether I regard THE GODFATHER PART III as a
major disappointment or not.  I was always somewhat dubious about the
promise of the film, particularly since Coppola did it for the money,
not because he really wanted to show us more.  The mixed reviews led me
to believe that the film might contain something of value, but I was
wrong.  If you feel that you must be a completist about this series, I
guess you should see THE GODFATHER PART III.  But if you are looking for
entertainment in a film, or artistic quality, look somewhere else.
There's actually some justice to the fact that HOME ALONE will probably
gross two to three times as much as this film.</P>
