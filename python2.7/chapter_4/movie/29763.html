<P>Serendipity is a popular ice cream parlor on Manhattan's Upper East Side. 
It's a nice place to get a sweet syrupy confection, and so is the movie to which
it lends its name, although the latter's labored contrivances come close to
pushing it over the edge, or driving us over the edge, whichever comes first. 
What keeps the movie palatable is the irresistibility of its two leads, John
Cusack and Kate Beckinsale, and the siren appeal of New York City at its most
winsomely romantic, a city caught inside a sparkling snow globe.  </P>
<P>Jonathan (Cusack) and Sara (Beckinsale, with her real accent) meet over a
pair of cashmere gloves at Bloomingdale's in the Christmas rush.  It's love at
first sight -- but Sara is more of a believer in second sight, and other
mystical phenomena.  They spend a magical Manhattan evening together, eating ice
cream, making witty small talk, riding the elevator at the Waldorf Astoria, ice
skating in Central Park, and tracing on her freckles the heavenly outline of
Cassiopeia, "who made one tragic mistake, and paid for eternity."  But they both
have romantic entanglements, and she won't give him her name or phone number. 
She does, however, write them in a copy of a novel which she sells to a used
bookstore.  She has him write his on a $5 bill, which she immediately spends. 
If fate brings these items back into their possession, they'll know they were
meant to be together.  (The novel is Love in the Time of Cholera, which is about
as close as the movie comes to acknowledging that there may be a dark underbelly
to this world.)</P>
<P>Time passes.  You know time has passed, because you get clocks spinning
their hands, sundials sweeping their shadows, and then, just in case you didn't
get it, the words "A few years later" superimposed on the screen.  </P>
<P>Jon's about to be married to Halley (Bridget Moynahan).  She's a lovely
girl, bur she isn't Kate Beckinsale.  Sara's moved to the other coast, where
she's about to be married to Lars (John Corbett).  He's a New Age musician,
which is all the information you need about that.  Before taking the final
plunge into sparkless matrimony, they each decide to make one last whirlwind try
at finding that lost perfect love.  </P>
<P>Each is accompanied in this quest by a Faithful Friend.  Jon's is his best
buddy Dean (Jeremy Piven, Cusack's real-life sidekick), an obit writer at the
New York Times (another acknowledgement of life's tragic side.)  Piven is very
funny, especially in his rehearsal dinner toast.  Less successful is SNL's Molly
Shannon as Sara's pal Eve, who owns a San Francisco New Age shop but doesn't
believe that sappy mystical stuff.  Neither, by this time, does Sara, and small
wonder, seeing where that sort of thing has gotten her in the past.  The movie
uses these friendships to make several coy allusions to homosexuality, but
there's neither substance or purpose to them.</P>
<P>There are some wonderful scenes.  One of the best showcases Eugene Levy as
a devious martinet of a Bloomingdale's salesman.  But more and more, as the
story doubles back and forth across its paths of near-miss and extravagant
coincidence, the bubbly charm of the earlier scenes give way to the tortured 
tyrannies of plot, until the characters seem to be racing from place to place at
the demands of the script and the director rather than in response to any inner
voice of their own.  And as the movie whirls to its inevitable conclusion, it
dodges its responsibilities in dealing with the messiness that comes with the
disposing of pleasant characters who have become no longer necessary.  (It also
disposes discreetly of those awkward reminders of unpleasantness on the New York
skyline, the twin towers of the World Trade Center.)  </P>
<P>"Serendipity" is a romantic comedy, and there's no reason why it should
have to deal with anything it doesn't want to, as long as the romance is
romantic and the comedy is comic.  Screwball comedy thrived as a distraction to
the Great Depression, romantic comedy helped us through WWII, and there's
probably enough of what it takes in this slight but sweet indulgence to pry us
away from CNN and take us out of ourselves for an hour and a half of easy
watching.  It's predictable, and it's exasperating, but it's pretty inoffensive.
 "Serendipity" is "An Affair to Remember" without the accident and the
wheelchair, and with a lot more laughs.</P>
