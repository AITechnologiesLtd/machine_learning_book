<P>        Harry says "tomaytoe."  Sally says "tomahtoe."  Harry says men and
women can't be friends because sex inevitably gets in the way.  Sally says
nonsense!  And that in a nutshell is the premise of WHEN HARRY MET
SALLY..., starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.  Director Rob Reiner has hit
pay dirt with WHEN HARRY MET SALLY...; the movie is a masterpiece, one of
the finest romantic comedies I have ever seen.  Like DEAD POETS SOCIETY,
it's the kind of movie that leaves you high and restores your faith in the
magic of motion pictures.</P>
<P>        Harry Burns and Sally Albright first meet in 1977 after graduating
from college.  They share a car from Chicago to New York and discover they
really don't like each other.  Their feelings haven't changed five years
later when they run into each other on a plane.  However, after another
five years have passed, Harry and Sally meet once again just as Harry's
wife has left him and Sally has broken up with her boyfriend.  This time
they click and a deep platonic relationship blossoms; they become best
friends.  The movie explores their tumultuous relationship as they
unwittingly fall in love.</P>
<P>        Reiner (SPINAL TAP, THE SURE THING, STAND BY ME) frames the story
within a series of recurring pseudo-documentary clips in which old,
long-married couples describe how they met and fell in love.  The people in
the clips are actors, but the stories they tell are real and range from the
absurd to the charming to the compelling.  The funniest husband and wife
talk simultaneously as they tell their love story.  Neither one will shut
up while the other is talking.  The documentary couples and their stories
provide timely commentary on the developments in Harry and Sally's
relationship.</P>
<P>        At the heart of WHEN HARRY MET SALLY..., crucial to its success,
are the exceptional performances by the two leads.  The biggest surprise is
Crystal, whose subtle performance looms head and shoulders above everything
else he has ever done.  For a change, Crystal makes his character much more
than a cardboard cut-out.  In the tradition of Woody Allen, Harry is
self-conscious and sees both the absurdity and tragedy in life.  His dark
side makes him pessimistic and cynical, but it also gives him a biting,
sarcastic sense of humor.  Crystal is extraordinarily adept at conveying
both the pathos and humor within Harry.</P>
<P>        Ryan, also delivering her finest performance to date, is equally
engaging as Sally, whose compulsive, structured personality tends to cut
her off from other people.  Like Harry, Sally is a full of quirks and
idiosyncrasies which make her seem genuine.  For instance, when ordering
from a menu, Sally drives waiters and waitresses crazy with her detailed
instructions about how her food should be prepared.</P>
<P>        Both of these characters are complicated, confused, and also
irresistibly appealing.  Their authenticity is refreshing, their motives
and behavior thought provoking, enough so to inspire inner reflections of
our own.  Watching Harry and Sally grow and mature and their relationship
develop is fascinating and moving.</P>
<P>        WHEN HARRY MET SALLY... is the consummate mix of humor, romance,
and human nature.  The movie is more than the sum of its parts--a true
collaborative effort.  Everyone involved in the film is in top form,
including Carrie Fisher in a supporting role as Sally's best friend.  You
know a movie is great when even Fisher delivers a good performance.  Bruno
Kirby, who plays Harry's best friend, also deserves mention for bringing
depth to his small role.</P>
<P>        Reiner's direction is authoritative and imaginative yet
unobtrusive.  He breathes new life into the technique of splitting the
screen in half during phone conversations; he takes it even one step
further and splits the screen into thirds in one ingenious scene.  The
story of Harry and Sally's relationship spans 11 years, and Reiner uses the
documentary clips to punctuate each chapter of their friendship.  The
passage of time in the film is unusually smooth and fluid.</P>
<P>        The screenplay by Nora Ephron (SILKWOOD, HEARTBURN) is wonderfully
clever.  Her dialogue is witty and frank; the characters talk and behave
like real people.  One small, seemingly insignificant bit of dialogue is to
me indicative of the film's greatness.  Sally starts to tell Harry, "All my
married friends with children say that..." but then she corrects herself,
"Actually, my one friend who has children tells me that..."  We all censor
and edit ourselves in every day conversation, but how many times do you see
a character do it in a movie?  In my mind, this one tiny moment reflects
just how closely the film has captured the human condition.</P>
<P>        Production designer Jane Musky has taken advantage of New York's
picturesque scenery (the browns and reds of autumn, the snowy white of
Christmas) to help Reiner capture the city's beauty.  The movie's
romanticized version of New York is refreshing after the disturbing
depictions we have seen recently in DO THE RIGHT THING, GHOSTBUSTERS II,
and even BATMAN.  The soundtrack of classic jazz standards--featuring Ella
Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, and Harry Connick, Jr.--always evokes just the
right mood.</P>
<P>        WHEN HARRY MET SALLY...  is so true to life that it cuts almost too
close to the bone as it shifts effortlessly between uproarious comedy and
poignant drama.  In exploring the possibility for platonic friendship
between men and women, Reiner has hit a nerve.  He has shed light on those
fundamental similarities and differences that unite and divide the sexes.
In case you're wondering, I haven't offered any criticisms of the film
because I don't have any.</P>
