                     A film review by Ken Johnson
                      Copyright 1991 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>140 min., PG, Fantasy, 1991
Director: Steven Spielburg
Cast: Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman, Julia Roberts, Bob Hoskins,
      Maggie Smith, Charlie Korsmo, Phil Collins, David Crosby, Glenn Close</P>
<P>     A retelling of the widely known fantasy Peter Pan.  This one,
though, has a big twist to it, Peter Pan (going by the name Peter
Banning) is now grown up and is a very successful business man.  So
successful, in fact, that he has no time for his family and has
forgotten about his childhood.  For Christmas, Peter, his wife, and two
children, go to London to visit Wendy.  Wendy has to go and give a
speech and Peter and his wife go with her.  They leave their children
alone in Wendy's house.  When they get back they find the house in
shambles and the children missing.  Attached to the bedroom door, with a
knife, is a note saying that if Peter ever wants to see his children
again he must come to get them, and it is signed Hook.  Peter must
journey to Never Never Land to try to remember his childhood and save
his children.</P>
<P>     HOOK is one of the best films I have seen in a long time!  The
special effects are well done and the story, except in a couple of
places, is very well done.  Those few spots when the script was lacking
didn't hinder my enjoyment of the film though.  The soundtrack, done by
John Williams, fits the film perfectly.  I definitely recommend that you
venture out to your local movie theater and see this film, even at full
price.  On a zero to five scale I give the film a five.  HOOK is rated
PG for explicit language and violence, but is perfectly acceptable to
bring the whole family to.</P>
<P>     Robin Williams plays Peter Pan and does a relatively good job.  As
Peter Banning, Robin Williams did a perfect job.  It was like the role
was written for him, a serious businessman who takes phone calls during
his daughter's play (of "Peter Pan," of course) but yet still finds time
to have fun, like dueling with cellular phones.  As Peter Pan, though,
something was missing.  He didn't quite fit the role.  Over all he did a
very good job, to the best of his abilities, which is the most you can
ask of someone.  And Robin Williams in green tights is a sight to see.</P>
<P>     Dustin Hoffman portrays the ultimate evil, Captain Hook.  He makes
Hook into an evil person but with some compassion.  For instance,
instead of just killing Peter Pan in the beginning when Peter can't
fight, Hook waits to give Peter a chance to make himself a better fighter
so Peter can have a chance.  Part of the reason for this, I am sure, was
to make Captain Hook seem not so scary to little children (I don't know
how well that worked because I went to the 9:30 PM showing and there were
no little children in the audience).  At times Hook will seem a to do
things a little odd, but if you just accept it, it will make the movie
run smoothly and thus makes the movie more enjoyable for you.  At some
spots in the film the script, the lines for Captain Hook could have been
written a little better, but Dustin Hoffman covers quite well in the
slow spots.  Overall Dustin Hoffman puts in a memorable performance.</P>
<P>     Julia Roberts plays TinkerBell, Peter Pan's friend fairy.
Although Julia Roberts would not have been my first choice for the role,
she, like everybody else in the movie, put in a very good performance.
In most of her scenes she was edited in, so she was seen with Peter Pan
or some of the Lost Boys, very effectively.  With the props used I found
myself believing that Julia Roberts was really that small in real life
which means that the special effects in the film are very good.  In my
opinion, TinkerBell is one of the most important roles in HOOK (second
to Peter Pan and Captain Hook) which means that the performance put out
by the actress is very important, and Julia lived up to my expectations.</P>
<P>     Maggie Smith plays Wendy, now grown to the age of eighty-something.
She remembers the days before Peter Pan grew up and when he decided to
grow up she helped him find a home, along with many of the Lost Boys.
In fact the speech she is giving is because she is being honored for her
work with children, which included finding homes for some of the Lost
Boys.  I don't have much to say for Maggie Smith's performance for she
is not on the screen very much but when she is she does a very good job.
Her character provides the sensitivity and compassion that Peter's kids
need and she is also the person who tries to explain to Peter who he
really is, but to no avail.</P>
<P>     Bob Hoskins portrays Smee, Captain Hook's right hand man.  He is
the brains behind most of Captain Hook's devious schemes to capture the
Lost Boys and to kill Peter Pan.  He is not given a chance though to
really express how he feels because Captain Hook steps in when ever he
tries.  Bob Hoskins role was not written so the character would be
really remembered after the film.  He was there mostly, I feel, because
he was in the original Peter Pan story, and for occasional comic relief.</P>
<P>     Charlie Korsmo (of DICK TRACY fame) plays Peter Pan's male child
and I missed who plays Peter's female child.  The two combined put in
good a performance, always fighting and playing, especially when Daddy
is on the phone trying to speak about some important business
information.  But apart the two don't do nearly as well, as proven
towards the end of the film.  Korsmo is a child that has a hard time
forgiving his dad after he has been let down, and this anger towards his
dad becomes very important towards the end of the film.  Peter's
daughter, on the other hand, is quick to forgive her dad, partially, I
feel, because she realizes even though he messes up he still loves her
very much.</P>
<P>     Pop singer Phil Collins shows up for a brief cameo as a police
detective that arrives at Wendy's house to investigate the missing
children.  David Crosby (of Crosby, Stills, and Nash) is one of Captain
Hook's fun loving pirates and, like Phil Collins, doesn't show up very
often in the film.  Glenn Close also shows up for a brief cameo in the
film.</P>
<P>     The biggest mistake in the writing of the film, I feel, is how the
Lost Boys were handled.  Most of Never Never Land has remained the same
way it was from when Peter Pan was there, but for some reason some of
the Lost Boys have been changed to the current times.  The new leader of
the Lost Boys has a punk hairdo and rides around on sort of a skate
board that runs on tracks.  The Lost Boys hide out has been equipped
with a basketball court, and a skate board rink even!  I feel that the
Lost Boys should have been left alone.  Some of the Lost Boys, on the
other hand, were unchanged in the ways that they act and are dressed.</P>
<P>     The sets were really well made, especially the ones for
TinkerBell.  They also really portrayed the fact that Peter Pan was no
longer in the regular world, but in a world that for the most part is
behind the "civilized" world.  The major set mistake was the Lost Boys
hide out.  The Lost Boys hideout is a giant tree on a raised island.
From the far shots the island looks really small, but when the people
are in the hideout, the hideout seems to stretch out for miles.  Also,
how do the Lost Boys make it onto the island.  Never in the film do the
Lost Boys fly and I am sure that they don't always go up the way Peter
did, by a giant sea shell that was raised from the ocean.</P>
<P>     The way the end of the film was handled was predictable and a
little disappointing.  I think that the most effort in a script should
go towards the ending, because for me the ending of a film makes it, or
breaks it.  Almost at the very end the script picks back up again and
just when you think that it has recovered it totally loses it with a
scene with.</P>
<P>     Other than these few mistakes, which you barely even notice when
watching the film, the film is very, very good.  Steven Spielberg's
directing was also very well done.  So run out to the movie theater to
see the film, but allow yourself plenty of time for the movie might sell
out early, and this is one not to miss.</P>
