<P>>From the makers of INDEPENDENCE DAY (6.5/10) comes the umpteenth remake
of the original monster movie classic Godzilla. I believe that there
have been over sixty variations of this picture filmed through its
various mutations, but this one claims to be the one that cost the most
clams: $140 million worth.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Nuclear radiation turns an ordinary lizard into a gigantic 500-foot+
beast. The giant monster roams into New York City, and consequently
terrifies and squashes many of its "innocent" inhabitants. The US
military, along with a nuclear radiation specialist (Broderick) are out
to stop this freakish abnormality from taking over. Mayhem and crazy
special effects ensue.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
"Been there, seen that" was my main reaction after the conclusion of
this film. This kind of picture may have been incredibly inventive and
original a few years back (think JURASSIC PARK (7.5/10)), but now it's
nothing more than a rehashed carnival of special effects. Okay,
admittedly the special effects are still quite spectacular, taped
alongside their partnered action sequences, but the crust of any film
still lies in its overall story line, and this pie just doesn't have
much cream to it, boys and girls. Standard characters conveying
contrived movie feelings through icky standard dialogue. The story is
basically this: Monster bad. Kill monster. And that's about it.</P>
<P>Other than that, the writers attempt to squeeze in another cheezy
romance between two bad actors (Broderick's career peaked and ended at
FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (8/10), give up the day job, dude, you're
done!), and a bunch of characters who have to disagree with the
theories of the "always-right" scientist. Smack that all together, and
you've got yourself another special effects airball of a movie! By the
way, is there any reason why the President of the United States of
America didn't get involved in this giant beast's destructive path
through New York City, while the French secret service made this
mission their top priority in life?? (Okay, so they kind of explain the
French involvement, but where the heck was the Prez through this
unthinkable disaster??).</P>
<P>For movie fanatics, watch for the fun-poking of Siskel & Ebert
throughout the entire picture by the way of Mayor Ebert and his
assistant Gene. In the end, the film does lengthen itself out by means
of another standard monster flic scenario ("Someone" re-emerges. Guess
who? Yawn.), and does end with the perpetual open door to an obvious
sequel, but that's about it. If you're in the mood to see a crazy
monster running loose in New York City and nothing more, then check
into this movie. If you're looking for something more interesting and
original to watch, I suggest you skip this over-hyped puppy, and warm
your nachos for several other interesting salsas to come on this
summer's fiesta line-up of films.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
Jean Reno's real name is Juan Moreno. He was born in Casablanca,
Morocco.
Harry Shearer does the TV Simpsons' voices of Charles Montgomery Burns,
Waylon Smithers, Ned Flanders, Seymour Skinner, Otto Mann and many
others. Hank Azaria does the Simpsons' voices of Apu
Nahasapeemapetilon, Moe Szyslak, Police Chief Clancy Wiggum, Comic Book
Guy, Dr. Nick Riviera, and many others.  
Matthew Broderick is married to fellow thespian Sarah Jessica Parker,
and is known for being the original choice to play Alex P. Keaton
(later played delectably by Michael J. Fox) in the long-running NBC
sitcom Family Ties. Broderick declined the proffered role, however,
because his father was dying of cancer in New York City at the time and
the job would have necessitated a move to Los Angeles.<HR>Visit JoBlo's Movie Reviews
