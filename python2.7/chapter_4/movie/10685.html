<P>BREAKING NEWS: This movie has swept the Golden Globes Awards in the musical
or comedy category: Best picture. Best actor (Jack Nicholson). Best actress
(Helen Hunt)</P>
<P>Now playing, the shaggy dog film "Wag the Dog" is dogless. Also playing is
"As Good as It Gets" in which a real shaggy dog -- a rare Brussels
Griffon--steals scenes and becomes the agent of major changes. Its name is
Verdell, which I first took for "Fidel," which  made me expect a partly
political film, which it isn't. Fitting no pigeonhole category, it comes
closest to a socio-psychological comedy-drama.</P>
<P>"As Good" also stars Jack Nicholson, in top para-Satanic and aggressive
form, circumflex eyebrows, hooded eyes ranking with the best (Victor
Mature's, Bob Mitchum's), incongruous tan for a New Yorker (but no one yet
has ever been able to challenge the deep bronzing of Douglas Fairbanks, Sr)
and his bag of eccentricities at an apex.</P>
<P>The movie has both originality and well-crafted, deja-filmed mainstream
appeal. Peripherally, it is  a distant variant on Beauty and the Beast, the
Taming of the Shrew (with sexes reversed). Centrally, it is  a showcase for
the talents of Nicholson and Helen Hunt.</P>
<P>Melvin Udall (Nicholson) is a misanthropic, bilious, hypochondriac,
reclusive mega-nut. His manias include always washing with a fresh cake of
soap; walking to the same restaurant daily at 11 am for a giga-cholesterol
breakfast at "his" table served by "his" waitress; bringing his own plastic
knives and forks; wearing disposable surgical gloves; avoiding brushing
against people or stepping on sidewalk cracks. All of this, plus more
quirks, is apparently explained by his suffering from obsessive-compulsive
disorder.</P>
<P>That's bad enough, but Melvin is a pain in every other way too. He's a
champion people-insulter and, among other lovely traits, homophobic,
African-American-fearing, and a Jew-and-everybody-else Equal Opportunity
hater. This includes animals. The action begins with Mel (who probably
hates his parents for his name) throwing his neighbor's beloved pooch
Verdell down the laundry chute.</P>
<P>The neighbor, Simon (Kinnear) is a successful painter, whose art dealer
friend is a classy African-American named with originality Frank Sachs
(Gooding). Both are gay, but not that you could tell. The other major
"dramatis persona" is Carol (Hunt),  Mel's habitual, suffering, and
onlywaitress acceptable to Mel at the restaurant. She is a single mother
with a dangerously asthmatic boy, lives with him her mother (Knight) in
far-off Brooklyn, trudging to and fro exhausted by her waitressing and her
motherly duties.</P>
<P>When Simon is brutally beaten up by invading, thieving street hoods, and
taken to the hospital, Frank sticks Mel with the dog in a way that Mel
cannot refuse. Predictably, grudgingly (and unconvincingly), the writer and
the canine fall for each other. Did I say "writer"? Yes, that's what Mel
does for a living, composing romances for female readership and making lots
of money from his 62 or so purple-prose novels. The contrast between his
profession and his character is absurd, rates an F for credibility. Mel
explains his knowing portrayals of women by :"I think of a man, then I take
away reason and accountability." This adds gynecophobia to the list, makes
us think of Mel as a virgin (??!!) and simply won't wash.</P>
<P>Upon his return from the hospital, Simon finds himself broke: he has no
health insurance (a real tragedy for so many self-employed), his medical
bill is over $60,000, his art has been vandalized, his will to paint has
vanished, he is losing his apartment. But look what  animal companionship
can do for people! Increasingly human and humane Mel comes to the rescue.
And by some intricate plot devices, he also delivers Carol and her son from
the evil of uncaring doctors and medical bills. It's artificial plotting
but while you are watching it, it is also warm, lovely and well-acted. All
the while, of course, Mel is falling for Carol. But the New Mel dies hard.
When he introduces his friends to one another he says:" Carol the waitress.
Simon the fag." I'll stop here.</P>
<P>NIcholson, in spite of his improbable role, is Nicholson, meaning as good
as ever, even better perhaps. No surprise here. The real  revelation is
Helen Hunt. I have never cared much for her flimsy, parts in TV's "Mad
About You," and while she has many more credits, too many of them were in
unmemorable productions. She was finally top-listed in her previous film
"Twister" (1996), but her role was pallid.</P>
<P>Now finally Helen Hunt has come into her own.  Without bravura or pointedly
dramatic or humorous scenes and repartees, without prettifying makeup or
sexy clothes, without scene-stealing episodes, Hunt does steal the whole
movie. In one of the most amazing transformations in recent cinema, she
makes palpable her struggle with life and conditions, her exhaustion as
waitress, caring mom, commuter and debtor in splendidly veristic ways.</P>
<P>We learn nothing about the father of her child, or for that matter about
the earlier Carol, yet she is three-dimensional both in her sadness,
depression, lack of men in her life as well as in her moments of humor and
happiness. Cannily, the script adds rounding off Carol through a
funny-turning-unfunny interlude with a lover who vanishes.</P>
<P>Aged beyond her 34 years , not especially pretty by ordinary standards, she
is enormously likable, appealing, real and, yes, even sexy. She also
strikes very believably at HMOs and the medical profession, though the
"deus ex machina" introduction of a wise, wonderful doctor restores some
balance. Yet, what with Simon's lack of insurance, a strong case is made
against our health system.</P>
<P>Multiple Oscar-winning writer-director-producer Brooks had previously
directed "Terms of Endearment," "Broadcast News" and the notorious "I'll Do
Anything," which, filmed as a musical, failed in previews and had to come
out as a non-musical. Even so, the latter is my favorite Brooks movie,
partly because of its superb direction of actors. Now Brooks repeats his
tour-de-force with Helen Hunt. No matter how iffy the tale, the
performances make it a winner.</P>
