<PRE>"The Replacement Killers" Almost Gets the Job Done
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>When I was in 2nd grade, I always looked forward to Fridays.  That was
the day that started off with Show and Tell.  I and my fellow
classmates would bring in our new pet frog, or new yo-yo, or a
fast-looking Hot Wheels car or some other shiny, new toy to impress
the others.  We said little to describe what we had because the items
were the show and nobody really listened to what we had to say anyway.
But we knew by the response of the classroom that we had to bring
something even better the next time.  It is now Hong Kong's turn to
play, and they have brought to America's film classroom something
shiny and slick called "The Replacement Killers" which is decidedly
more 'show' than 'tell'. </P>
<P>The central part of this 'show' is a cool and suave Asian-action star
by the name of Chow Yun-Fat.  Having filmed dozens of movies in Hong
Kong, America now gets its first peek at Asia's Clint Eastwood.  As
John Lee, he is a reluctant assassin who handles guns in the same way
Monet handles a paint brush.  He is a deadly marksman, but he is also
an indentured servant of ruthless crime lord, Terence Wei.  If he
fails to perform, Wei will not hesitate to kill Lee's family.  But in
his latest assignment, his conscience prevents him from squeezing the
trigger.  He knows that there will be consequences, and he must use
his killer instincts to not only survive but to find a way to flee to
China to rescue his family.</P>
<P>Needing a fake passport, he meets up with Meg (Mira Sorvino), a
professional forger, but before she even has time to develop his
photo, Wei's henchmen arrive to kill him.  After a furious gun battle,
Lee manages to escape, and as the film progresses, the brooding hitman
finally begins to internalize the ruthlessness and evilness of Wei.
He slowly begins to realize that he needs to do more than just save
his family.  He must also save Meg as well as the person that he was
ordered to assassinate.</P>
<P>For a film where the guns do most of the talking, it isn't just a
one-dimensional shoot-em up.  The tone of the film is quickly
established early on, and its level of combustibility never
diminishes.  Elements of Hong Kong movie making add a certain aura of
style to the look of the film.  Shot in dark alleyways and small
buildings throughout LA's Chinatown, we feel the stress of his
claustrophobic situation.  Many dramatic scenes are shown in poetic
slow motion.  Gunplay dominates the movie, but the shootouts are
well-choreographed and gives Chow Yun-Fat ample opportunity to show
off his skills as he spins, leaps and pirouettes while gunning down
his enemies.  He is cool under fire; never cracks a joke; and
dispatches his enemies in an icy-cold, professional, no-nonsense
manner.  This characterization is the essence of Chow, and this is his
show.</P>
<P>As a result, the movie has a difficult time developing the chemistry
between Lee and Meg.  Also adept at handling a gun, it seemed
painfully obvious that the writers didn't want her to compete with
Chow's presence.  Although she's a prominant character, Meg doesn't
really leave any kind of mark, and presumably, Sorvino's inclusion may
have been just a casting decision to put someone familiar to American
audiences to improve its marketability.  Also, Lee's character is a
quiet man, so there isn't too much by way of dialogue. </P>
<P>There is no doubt that Chow is likable and that this is a competent
action film for those who like their stories peppered with an
industrial soundtrack, sunglass-wearing thugs; and scenes where the
heroes are running for their lives amid a hail of bullets.  At 90
minutes, the movie takes you where you want to go without any annoying
detours.  It probably could have done a lot more, but manages to be a
nice show piece.  I know that the Hong Kong movie makers will bring
something even better next time.</P>
