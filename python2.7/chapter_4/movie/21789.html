<P>Featuring Justin Hall, Harold Rheingold, Jaime Levy, Julie Petersen,
Carl Steadman, Marjorie Silver, Denise Tenorio, Doug Block. Not Rated
(the equivalent of a mild R for profanity, brief nudity and general
weirdness).</P>
<P>Trying to decipher the true nature and purpose of the internet is akin
to trying to figure out the meaning of life, in that it is an
impossible endeavor. Even in 1996, when this movie was shot, the world
wide web was so many different things to so many different people; now,
it has become an institution comparable to television. Everyone's got
it, some can't live without it. While it may be exceedingly difficult
to "figure out" the net, it would be nice if we could make some sense
out of it and that is exactly what the new documentary Home Page, in
its mature, thoughtful manner, tries to do.</P>
<P>Filmmaker Doug Block started out with the honorable intention of making
a film diary of his adorable little toddler daughter. That was until he
met Justin Hall. A college student at the time, Hall is what we
commonly call a "nerd." He dresses bizarrely, spends an exorbitant
amount of time staring at the computer screen and, most interestingly,
posts every detail of his life on his webpage (<A HREF="http://www.links.net">http://www.links.net</A>).</P>
<P>Block follows Justin through the next few years of his eccentric
existance and is inspired to make his own webpage, a journal of his
documentary travails (The D-Word). Justin, meanwhile, goes on a country-
spanning trip promoting the internet. His Odyssey finally lands him in
San Francisco, where he moves in with famed internet author and guru
Howard Rheingold, whom he greatly admires. They work on the development
of "Electric Minds," an ambitious web magazine that went "out of
business" some seven months after its launch.</P>
<P>The film's focus isn't just on Justin; indeed, we become intimately
familiar with some other interesting people such as Rheingold himself,
Julie (<A HREF="http://www.awaken.org">http://www.awaken.org</A>), Justin's former honcho at HotWired (a
web magazine where he was an intern), as well as the people behind
Suck, a popular, satirical internet publication. These folks all offer
their theories on the web; some are funny, some are weird, all are
interesting.</P>
<P>Home Page begins by abandoning all skepticism. Block acknowledges the
fact that the internet is indeed the future and goes from there. His
subjects' musing comes off as intelligent speculation from people who
know what they are talking about, rather than disjointed ramblings of
web weirdoes, which he easily could have given us. The film works
because it isn't gimmicky or pretentious, rather, it's sincere. Here is
a film with an affection for its subject.</P>
<P>Block finally comes up with the obvious: the internet is a place where
a person of any race, religious affiliation, personality and generation
can communicate and find people with similar interests. For some it is
a way of life, for others it's but a mild diversion, but it has
something for everyone. Granted, this is fairly simple stuff but Block
finds creative, personal ways of presenting it, until we begin to get a
more thorough understanding of the web's significance and its meaning
in all of our lives. Home Page doesn't serve as an instigator of new
and radical ideas, rather, it pushes an already realized and still
valid thought up a notch.</P>
<P>The movie ends with a shot that is at once chilling and promising: a
girl stares, transfixed, at a computer monitor while the notorious
internet logon phone sound plays in the background. There is a child
with an advantage, gazing at the future with those wide, endlessly
curious eyes.</P>
