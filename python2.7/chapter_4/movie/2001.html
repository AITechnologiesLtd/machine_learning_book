<PRE>                            LAST ACTION HERO
                       A film review by Jon Webb
                        Copyright 1993 Jon Webb</PRE>
<P>     I'd heard this film was "Goddard-esque" -- a commentary of
film-making.  But I found it to be a mess.  It is neither a parody of
action films nor an action film itself; it is something in between, and
it fails at making you care about any of the characters, hence making
the movie itself of little interest.</P>
<P>     Schwarzenegger plays a movie character who is idolized by a young
boy.  The boy magically gets transported into the action film itself,
which is a parody of action films with ridiculous coincidences and
cardboard characters.</P>
<P>     The thing is, you're supposed to be laughing at the obviousness of
the action film inside the film while still caring about the
relationship between Schwarzenegger and the young boy.  But you can't
do both.</P>
<P>     The movie also contains a lot of references to other films,
including brief cameos by people from other cop films set in L.A.  (for
example, Sharon Stone), an outrageous L.A. police station with women in
S&M outfits, inside jokes (like having Joan Plowright introduce
Laurence Olivier's HAMLET), and self-directed humor like
Schwarzenegger appear in the film as himself promoting some store he
has a business interest in.</P>
