<PRE>                              OF MICE AND MEN
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1993 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>1:59, PG-13, Drama, 1992
Director: Gary Sinise
Cast: John Malkovich, Gary Sinise, Sherilyn Fenn, Ray Walston,
      Alexis Arquette, Joe Morton, Casey Siemaszko, John Terry,
      Noble Willingham</P>
<P>     Gary Sinise and John Malkovich are migrant farm workers.  John
Malkovich isn't very bright and keeps getting the two in trouble.
Sinise watches over Malkovich and tries to keep him out of trouble.
They go to work on Noble Willingham's farm where Malkovich starts
having problems with Willingham's son Casey Siemaszko.</P>
<P>     OF MICE AND MEN is the third film version of John Steinbeck's
novel.  I haven't seen the 1939 version yet.  I think that this version
of OF MICE AND MEN is much better than the 1981 television film (which
received a three).  This film follows the novel very closely.  I
definitely recommend this film to everybody.  On a scale of zero to
five, I give OF MICE AND MEN a five.  OF MICE AND MEN is rated PG-13
for explicit language and graphic violence.</P>
<P>     The cast for this version is much better than the '81 version.  I
think that John Malkovich (SHADOWS AND FOG, EMPIRE OF THE SUN) does a
much better Lenny than Randy Quaid did.  Likewise Gary Sinise does a
better George than Robert Blake did.  Ray Walston (BLOOD RELATIONS,
POPCORN, and for all of you who wrote back on my review of POPCORN, "My
Favorite Martian") gave the best performance in this film.  Walston
plays the old man on the farm and I feel that he adds a lot to the
film.  Sherilyn Fenn (MERIDIAN: KISS OF THE BEAST, BACKSTREET DREAMS)
gives her best performance since TWO MOON JUNCTION as Casey Siemaszko's
flirtatious wife.  Casey Siemaszko (BREAKING IN, THREE O'CLOCK HIGH) is
great as the boss's cruel son.</P>
<P>     This film is very well written, and gets extremely dramatic in
places (I haven't seen so many wet eyes leaving the theater).  I think
that this film will have a better impact if you see it in the theater,
so do so if you have the chance still.  It has been released on video
cassette.  Both the settings and photography for this film are top
notch.</P>
