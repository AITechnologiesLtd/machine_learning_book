<PRE>                  DR. SEUSS'S HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     So what are the Christmas traditions at your home?  At ours, for
as long as I can remember, we have curled up on the sofa and watched
DR. SEUSS'S HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS (1966).</P>
<P>     In the middle of a frantic Christmas season, there is no better
respite from the buy-me commercialism of the holidays than this short,
but poignant story by Dr. Seuss.  And there are few children's authors
as literate and imaginative as the great Dr. Seuss.  It is a shame that
more of his works have not been made into movies or at least televised
shorts.  His only full length movie is THE 5,000 FINGERS OF DR. T. for
which he wrote the screenplay.  (And the only published review I have
ever seen of it is mine in the Internet Movie Data Base.)</P>
<P>     Dr. Seuss has always been my favorite author to read to my son,
and Dr. Seuss was one of my favorites which I was a child.  His stories
usually rhyme.  ("The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins" is one of the
major exceptions.)  He takes a liberal view of the English language and
revels in inventing words.  He even has a book, "On Beyond Zebra!,"
where he devises new letters as well.  His arguments are convincing
ones.  No one who has read "On Beyond Zebra!" will ever again be
satisfied with the twenty-six puny little letters we have in English.
As he so amply demonstrates, there are so many words that just can not
be spelled with them.</P>
<P>     The GRINCH is narrated by the great Boris Karloff.  His rich and
powerful voice dominates the film.  His villain is mean enough to be
real without being too scary, thus giving us a film which can be
enjoyed by three year olds as well as eighty-three year olds.  Although
he speaks his lines, his voice is so melodious that it is singing to my
ears.</P>
<P>     The animation is minimalist, but heartwarming.  It has all the
looks of an inexpensive production for television, which it was, but do
not be fooled by its low cost exterior.  This is a film with a big
heart that manages never to be sappy no matter how familiar the story
may sound.  Few writers can teach the value of creativity as can Dr.
Seuss, and few have his love of life.</P>
<P>     In the GRINCH, our protagonist is a scrooge who lives high on a
mountain and detests the happy villagers in the valley below.  Called
Whoville, it is populated with Normal Rockwell style cartoon figures.
Typical is little Cindy Lou Who, "who is no more than two," and who has
a smile that would melt butter.</P>
<P>     The Grinch hates the happy noises of the children on Christmas,
and, most of all, he finds their singing an abomination.  He concocts a
simple scheme.  All he needs to do is dress up like Santa Claus.  He
can then steal all of their Christmas presents, trees, and roast beast.
That will certainly prevent Christmas from coming and will provide him
his desired gloomy silence.</P>
<P>     The morose Grinch has a sweet little dog.  One look at the dog,
and it is love at first sight for the audience.  The Grinch forces him
to put on heavy fake antlers and pull an overloaded sled, but the dog
smiles and tries hard to please his master.</P>
<P>     The songs by Albert Hague are as hokey as can be, but still
lovable.  This is an old children's show, so you have to give it a
little leeway.</P>
<P>     The absolutely predictable ending is none the less effective.
When the children start singing even without the trappings of the
Christmas season, the Grinch's heart "grows three sizes that day."  And
Boris Karloff says, "Maybe Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a
store.  Maybe Christmas, he thought, means a little bit more."  As the
show concludes, the families in Whoville join hands and sing, "Welcome
Christmas while we stand, heart to heart, and hand to hand."</P>
<P>     DR. SEUSS'S HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS runs just 26 minutes.
It is not rated but would get a G.  There is nothing offensive or scary
in it.  It is an ideal show for all ages at Christmas.  My son Jeffrey,
age 7 1/2, my wife, and I all recommend it to you strongly.  The world
would be a better place if everyone would ponder its clear message.  I
give the GRINCH *** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
