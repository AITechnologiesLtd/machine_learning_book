<P>Errol Morris, critically acclaimed director of the 1997 documentary
FAST, CHEAP AND OUT OF CONTROL, vaults to new heights with MR. DEATH.
This film, an examination of the life and work of controversial
execution equipment designer and revisionist historian Fred A. Leuchter,
Jr., is sure to draw audiences out of their malaise, stunning even the
more jaded minds among us.</P>
<P>Don't let the film's cheesy dissuade you.  Following this sideshow of
horror-lab special effects we are plunged quickly into a non-stop
exploration of the weirdness that is Leuchter's life and mind.  Morris
follows the trail of Leuchter's madness with appalling lucidity,
revealing in a surprising and frightening way what most of us could have
guessed to begin with: This Leuchter guy is seriously messed up.</P>
<P>Virtually raised within the American penal system by a father who worked
within prison walls, Leuchter seems to have come somewhat naturally into
his profession; designing and maintaining execution equipment for state
penitentiaries, in spite of his lack of credentials.  After a moderately
successful career making electric chairs and designing gas chambers and
gallows, Leuchter came to the attention of neo-Nazi and revisionist
historian Ernst Zundel, who was facing criminal charges in Germany for
publishing his `theory' that the holocaust never happened.</P>
<P>Morris's interviews are surprisingly congenial, drawing the subjects
into a carefree banter that gives them more than enough rope with which
to hang themselves.  Zundel speaks to the camera as though it were his
mensch.  Leuchter seems completely at ease, sometimes jovial.  Part of
this effect may be due to Morris's new interviewing machine, called the
Interrotron, which is responsible for creating eye contact between the
subject and the interviewer.  This was the first time Morris had used
the device, and the results are startling.</P>
<P>Combine the irony of these interviews with Leuchter's reenactments and
reels of creepy stock footage of his trip to Auschwitz and Birkenau, not
to mention a haunting clip of Thomas Edison electrocuting an elephant,
and you've got one compelling and disturbing documentary.  While this
film isn't for the feeble-minded or weak-hearted, it is a valuable
addition to the cultural landscape.  Aside from a few dragging minutes
toward the end of the piece, Morris has given us a fresh look at a
dismal subject and I, for one, feel bettered by the experience.</P>
<PRE>Four stars out of five.</PRE>
