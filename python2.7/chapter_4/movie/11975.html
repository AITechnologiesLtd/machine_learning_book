<P>     'City of Angels' is from director Brad Silberling (1995's 'Casper')
and is based on the 1988 Wim Wenders film 'Wings of Desire'.  The
setting for this film is Los Angeles and the poetic tone the film
projects for its entire running time is both mystical, hypnotic and
truly gives the viewer an emotional experience that doesn't just come
from the performances of its two leads but from the overall beauty of
its story and how things develop based upon some early scenes of
tenderness and gentle kindness.  The opening scene is a little girl's
bedroom and the child is running a fever of 105 and her mother takes her
to the hospital, all the while under the observation of an angel named
Seth (Nicolas Cage).  Upon receiving treatment at the hospital, a second
image of the child is seen standing next to Seth, obviously her spirit
ready for the journey towards Heaven and Seth explains that she will see
her mother again one day.</P>
<P>     Seth is captivated by a beautiful doctor named Maggie Rice (Meg
Ryan) and falls in love with her.  He tries to comfort her after the
unavoidable death of a patient in her care who died on the operating
table of a serious heart condition.  Maggie blames herself but her
superiors at the hospital and her eventual encounter with Seth convince
her otherwise. It seems that Seth and other angels like him can't be
seen unless they want to be.</P>
<P>     Cage and Ryan are very well matched as lovers in the film and their
chemistry gives the film the leverage it needs to maintain its tone from
start to finish.  Also thrown into this already impressive cast is a
cardiac patient (Dennis Franz) at Maggie's hospital who knows of Seth's
identity and because I want to avoid this becoming a spoiler review, I
will stop here.</P>
<P>     There are some rather interesting scenes of beauty such as the
early morning California sunrises which a group of angels gather for
regularly to observe for its beauty and appreciated simplicity.  Seth
seems to hear music in the sunrise and takes pleasure in the fascinating
quality of the human experience and this draws him closer to Maggie as
the film moves along.  Maggie eventually falls in love with Seth and the
two of them try and embrace in the total human experience and Seth must
face a choice of continuing as one of God's messengers or joining the
human race on Earth.</P>
<P>     What I wanted to avoid thinking about throughout the course of this
film, were inevitable comparisons to films such as 'Ghost' and 'Heaven
Can Wait' and while 'City of Angels' is not a completely original film,
it does have the magic to make it a good film, lacking greatness because
of its somewhat muddled ending.  Cynics will trash the film for being
too nice for its own good while others will appreciate it for its
old-fashioned and mostly successful take on the oldest story in the
world, love.</P>
