<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>Some movies just aren't what you suspected. They surprise you, go against
their promos so much that you hate those boys on Madison Avenue (even more
than I already do). One example is Antz, a movie that is advertised as a
family fun adventure but turns out to be a social satire.</P>
<P>Take the first few seconds. Immature humor? An ant's tiny fart here or
there? No. Instead we find out that Woody Allen still has his shrink, even
as an ant. It's one of those movies with an adult audience and a child's
rating. In fact, even the eight-year-olds didn't laugh at the dry humor
encased in this anthill of gold.</P>
<P>I liked it, though. I mean, how many times do you get an intelligent movie
that animated?
How often does Gene Hackman play a villain astride Christopher Walken
playing a hero.
When does Sylvester Stallone say his lines right, Sharon Stone not look like
she's about to kill you with an ice pick, and Woody Allen … wait, he's still
nuts. But anyway, it was a change. And I guess I have one saying about
movies that I hold dear: Change is good.</P>
