<P>     The vision presented in Larry Clark's KIDS is as bleak as things 
get -- an ugly portrait of amoral youths who resort to drugs and sex not 
as a form of rebellion, but to fill the void of otherwise empty and 
meaningless lives.  Unfortunately, KIDS is an accurate portrayal of how 
certain inner city children live out their existences.  Take a look at 
the documentary TEEN DREAMS if you doubt how dangerously close to 
reality this fictional presentation comes. </P>
<P>     On the outside, Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) is the kind of clean-cut 
teenage boy any mother might let her daughter go out with.  He looks 
"normal" -- perhaps even a little nerdy -- and can be polite and sincere 
when it suits him.  But Telly is an inveterate liar.  He will say or do 
anything to satisfy his addiction for deflowering virgins.  Sexually 
uninitiated girls present the greatest challenge and, as a bonus, are 
guaranteed disease-free.  Not that he believes in AIDS anyway -- 
condoms, in his opinion, are a waste of time. </P>
<P>     Telly's best friend is Casper (Justin Pierce).  While Casper also 
enjoys sex, his partners don't have to come with their hymens intact.  
And Casper's as much into drugs and drink as sleeping with girls.  Like 
Telly, he's not concerned about the future or the consequences of his 
actions.  He takes life as it comes, whether that means inhaling dope, 
raping a stoned girl, or beating someone half to death with a 
skateboard. </P>
<P>     Then there's Jennie (Chloe Sevigny), who's only had sex once, but, 
without protection, that was enough to do irreparable damage.  When her 
HIV test comes back positive, her life collapses around her.  Nothing 
makes sense.  Her best friend, Ruby (Rosario Dawson), has had sex with 
at least eight guys, yet she's clean.  And when Jennie rushes to stop 
another girl from sharing her fate, she arrives too late. </P>
<P>     KIDS is shot like a documentary and, in its uncompromising 
depiction of every aspect of the characters' social and sexual 
interactions, it seems almost too raw for fiction.  Clark has 
meticulously designed this movie to blur the lines between reality and 
scripted story, hiring 20 year old Harmony Korine to write a screenplay 
that reflects what's really going on in the streets.  The actors are all 
newcomers, and their unfamiliar faces and unpolished-yet-effective 
performances add to the documentary-like effect.   </P>
<P>     KIDS follows the activities of a small group of teenagers over a 
twenty-four hour period (a little time frame cheating, by way of 
flashbacks, occurs).  And what a twenty-four hours it is...  KIDS will 
likely shock some viewers, but even those expecting this kind of 
grueling expose will be disturbed by the casual manner in which the most 
heinous acts are carried out.  If people lose their souls as children, 
what happens when they grow up?  This is a tragedy without a last act -- 
a wrenching experience that offers no catharsis. </P>
<P>     One of the ironies surrounding KIDS is that the MPAA wanted to slap 
it with an NC-17, which would have disallowed anyone under 17 from 
seeing it.  Yet, despite the graphic nature of the material, this is the 
sort of thing many teenagers live with every day -- so, apparently, the 
message is that they can experience it outside theaters, but not view it 
on the screen.  Miramax's decision to release the film unrated through a 
spinoff company at least allows the under-17 crowd an opportunity to see 
KIDS, if only in the company of a parent or legal guardian. </P>
<P>     Those who call KIDS exploitative may have seen the film, but they 
haven't bothered to really watch it.  There is not a gratuitous moment 
in this picture, although some of the images are so strong that viewers 
will wish to close their eyes or turn away.  KIDS shows what transpires 
when children are set adrift in a heartless world, and warns us what 
happens -- and is already happening -- in the absence of love and 
guidance. </P>
