ESCAPE FROM ABSOLOM
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Among the names of the cast and crew that are supposed
attract the audience to the films, producers are usually
least used. However, there are some exceptions. One of them
is Gale Anne Hurd, former spouse of James Cameron and
producer of ALIENS. Her name on the credits was reason
enough for the author of this review to actually watch
ESCAPE FROM ABSOLOM, 1994 futuristic prison thriller,
directed by Martin Campbell.</P>
<P>Those who had watched FORTRESS, 1993 film by Stuart Gordon,
would find some familiar scenes in the beginning of ABSOLOM.
The year is 2022 and prisons became the profitable business.
Former Marine Captain John Robbins (played by Ray Liotta)
had killed his general and got sentenced to life in maximum
security, state of the art prison called Leviticus. However,
after ofending the sadistic warden (Michael Lerner), Robbins
finds himself dumped on Absolom, small Pacific island from
which there is no escape. The prisoners like Robbins are
left to fend for themselves, and Robbins soon finds two
factions - savage, barbaric Outsiders led by brutal Marek
(Stuart Wilson) and peaceful, idealistic Insiders led by
Father (Lance Henriksen) who want to redeem their past sins
by making the island their private utopia. After a while,
Robbins would use his military talents to help Insiders in
their struggle against Outsiders.</P>
<P>ESCAPE FROM ABSOLOM is just another proof that producers, no
matter how good their reputation is, can't guarantee quality
of the film in the absence of talented or, at least capable,
writers and directors. Screenplay by Michael Gaylin and Joel
Gross, based on the novel PENAL COLONY by Richard Herley,
has a rather weak and hardly plausible concept - heartless
futuristic society, who had shown no concern for the
wellbeing of prisoners, still ready to spend billions on
keeping them in supertechnological chains instead of simply
killing them. However, unlike FORTRESS who had the similar
flaw, this film offers quite a different feel. Instead of
supertechnology, we have society brought down to good old
post-apocalyptic savagery, in many ways reminding us of MAD
MAX and LORD OF THE FLIES. For some time, it looks like the
film might leave the audience with something to think about
- nature of evil and violence, but then it all boils down to
predictable and cliched prison break subplot. Thankfully,
there is always enough hand- to-hand combat to make us
forget the actual plot. The actors are mostly fine - Liotta,
although not a real action hero, is believable as killer
turned into nice guy; character actors, mostly British, are
also superb. However, Stuart Wilson as chief villain is
almost laughable, proving again (same as in LETHAL WEAPON 3)
that he lacks adequate charisma for such task. Action scenes
are adequately directed by Martin Campbell and also there
aren't any female characters to slow down the action with
unnecessary romantic subplots. This film mostly is
watchable, but then, as many other similarly forgettable
action films, everything culminates in predictable yet
unbelievable and lame finale. After such finale, most of the
viewers would feel cheated, even if they hadn't got high
hopes before watching this bellow-the-average Hollywood
genre product.</P>
