<P>DECONSTRUCTING HARRY
(Fine Line Features)
Directed by Woody Allen
 After such recent frothy forays as "Everyone Says I Love You" and "Mighty
Aphrodite," it comes as a shock to see Woody Allen deliver "Deconstructing
Harry," a vicious black comedy that calls to mind such earlier Allen as
"Crimes and Misdemeanors" and "Stardust Memories." Set against those two,
"Harry" has a more singular focus than "Crimes" and is a much more
successful examination of a writer's psyche than "Stardust." By turns
clever, devestating, bitter and delightful, this challenging piece of work
is easily one of Allen's most mature efforts to date.
 It also offers him an opportunity to play one of his least sympathetic
characters. Harry Block is a self-loathing post-middle-age novelist whose
fiction recalls the work of Philip Roth. But Harry has also written a savage
roman a clef about the faithless, superficial types in his life. "You take
everyone's suffering and turn it into gold!" accuses Lucy (Judy Davis), one
of Harry's several neurotic ex-lovers. Unable to cope with the demands of
loving relationships any longer, Harry now hires prostitutes, such as the
streetwise Cookie Williams (the delightful Hazelle Goodman), a weary vixen
in pink spandex cut-offs and a tie-dyed tank-top who Harry recruits as his
date for a ceremony his former college --he was thrown out before
graduation, so it's not technically his alma mater-- is holding to honor
him.
 Harry doesn't feel much like celebrating, however, since he's suffering
from crippling writer's block. During the course of the film, often at
unexpected moments, Harry's stories come to life and we can see for
ourselves how Harry combined personality traits from both a chilly ex-wife
(a knockout Kirstie Alley) and his rigidly religious sister (Caroline Aaron)
to create the character of Helen, who describes herself as "the shrewish
Jewish hybrid," and is marvelously played by an imaginatively cast Demi
Moore. Harry's isolationism also comes through in his tale of a movie actor
(Robin Williams) who realizes he's somehow become permanently out-of-focus,
and is destined to drift through life as a blur. "Deconstructing Harry"
features many such inspired bits.
 It also continues Allen's experimentation with offbeat camerawork and
editing. He's previously utilized a weaving hand-held camera in "Husbands
and Wives" and attempted Bergmanesque imagery in "Interiors" and
"September," and in "Harry," he tries out the kind of jump-cut editing
popularized by Godard and Truffaut in such films as "Breathless" and "Shoot
The Piano Player." Though the technique sometimes comes off as slightly
self-conscious, it effectively points up Harry's fragmented, chaotic world.
 More off-putting to some of Allen's fans may be the harshness of the
language used by many of the characters, although again, it's perfectly in
keeping with the rage most of these people are feeling. In previous films,
Allen concentrated on the lighter side of divorce: When Meryl Streep left
him and wrote a tell-all book about their failed marriage in "Manhattan,"
Allen played the idea for easy laughs. But Harry's thinly veiled portraits
of his friends and family do some real damage and almost inspire one of his
subjects to kill him. The humor cuts deeper and the laughter is sometimes
tinged with a gasp of disbelief. The brilliance of  "Deconstructing Harry"
lies in Allen's deft blending of its many tones: sardonic,  sarcastic and
sentimental.</P>
