<P>Georgia, Diane Keaton's character in the new film Hanging Up, says it 
best: "it's possible our father will never die." Audiences can 
sympathize as they groan through this 92-minute story of three sisters 
and their elderly, senile father. It shouldn't come as a surprise that, 
just before credits role, Lou (Walter Matthau) will pass away- it is 
what is expected. Unfortunately, what passes the time is no more 
entertaining than those telephone salesmen that always ring during 
dinner.</P>
<P>Eve (Meg Ryan), Geogia and Maddy (Lisa Kudrow) are three sisters 
separated by profession but connected by AT&T. Georgia is the wealthy 
founder of a self-titled magazine, Maddy is a quasi-celebrity soap 
actress and Eve is a frazzled house-wife/mother trying to succeed in the 
business world via "No Surprises", her party planning company.</P>
<P>As Lou's health worsens with more and more incoherent references to 
"John Wayne's pecker" and death becomes imminent, Eve finds herself as 
the sole caretaker since only she is willing to set aside the time for 
her father. As phones ring all night, she exclaims "he's dead," always 
to be proven wrong. Where are the other two offspring of this divorced 
father? On the set and in the conference room.</P>
<P>Despite being directed by Keaton, Hanging Up is Meg Ryan's movie. Kudrow 
and Keaton, save their star-status, would only be considered extras 
during the first 80 minutes of the film. They are prominent at the end, 
but the production remains a vehicle for Meg Ryan as an actress and 
Walter Matthau as a supporting actor (who does very well in a role much 
akin to that of Jason Robards in Magnolia). Additionally, I'm not sure 
that Kudrow and Keaton's performances qualify as acting- they seem a tad 
too comfy playing pampered and strictly selfish blonde women.    </P>
<P>Traditionally, when making films where the ending will be marked by an 
obvious death, a secondary plot is added to keep the audience engaged. 
In the 1993 masterpiece Philadelphia, a fascinating and oftentimes 
gripping legal battle dominates the screen. Delia Ephron, whose freshman 
novel is the premise for the movie, obviously is not a Jonathan Demme or 
Tom Hanks fan as the death of Lou is the only saga here.</P>
<P>This script would probably never have been produced except for the fact 
that Delia's sister is Nora Ephron. Call her the Tori Spelling of 
writing, because this once respected journalist/non-fiction author will 
achieve nothing in the world of Hollywood's fictional films without her 
sibling's help.</P>
<P>Many people can sympathize with this tale of cell phones, car phones, 
portable phones, stationary phones and the family at the other end of 
them. That may well be the singular gleaming point of the film. 
Unfortunately though, at the end, the movie proves to be no more 
enjoyable than the resultant enormous phone bill.</P>
