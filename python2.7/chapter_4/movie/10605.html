<PRE>B.A.P.S.</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: ** (out of ****) </PRE>
<P>New Line / 1:30 / 1997 / PG-13 (language, crude humor, big hair)
Cast: Halle Berry; Martin Landau; Natalie Desselle; Ian Richardson; Jonathan 
Fried; Luigi Amodeo; Troy Beyer 
Director: Robert Townsend 
Screenplay: Troy Beyer </P>
<P>A fish-out-of-water movie where the fish have bigger fingernails than Barbra 
Streisand herself, "B.A.P.S." offers up some pretty funny moments before 
self-destructing in its second half. What starts out as a sly, nasty comedy 
takes its story a little too seriously, and serves up a earnest ending 
oozing with false sentiment. It's a good thing "B.A.P.S." has a solid 
comedic team in stars Halle Berry ("Executive Decision," "The Rich Man's 
Wife") and Natalie Desselle ("Set It Off"), or the final stretch of this 
movie would be near intolerable. </P>
<P>Berry and Desselle are respectively cast as homegirls Nisi and Mickey, two 
greasy spoon waitresses from Decatur, Georgia, who have big ideas and bigger 
hair -- not to mention the gold teeth and unsightly wardrobe. After learning 
that MTV is looking for the "Video Dance Girl of the Year," and that the 
winner will be awarded $10,000, the dynamically-dressed and -tressed duo 
drop everything and catch a flight to Los Angeles. After their dreams are 
shattered when they lose the contest, a chauffeur takes them to a swank 
Beverly Hills mansion, where a plan is hatched. The estate's owner, Mr. 
Blakemore (Martin Landau, here perhaps to pick up a paycheck?), is 
terminally ill, and his nephew (Jonathan Fried) offers Nisi the same amount 
of cash to stick around for a week and impersonate the granddaughter of his 
long lost love, hoping to lift the old man's spirits during his final days. </P>
<P>No bonus points for guessing Nisi and Mickey are going to reform Blakemore 
and his home with their sassy, snappy ways -- that development is 
telegraphed from the movie's get-go. Still, the predictability wouldn't have 
mattered as long as "B.A.P.S." understands it's a spoof first and foremost. 
Unfortunately, the plot, as scant as it is, turns into something solemn, 
throwing silliness out the window for dumb twists and a finale that actually 
asks us to emote. "B.A.P.S.," which stands for black American princesses, is 
much more successful when it stays far away from fairy tale territory. </P>
<P>There are quite a few good moments to be salvaged from the eventual mess, 
though. Nisi and Mickey's arrival into high society is amusing, as are their 
misadventures with his crusty, no-nonsense English butler (is there any 
other kind?) Manly, a character foil played marvelously by Ian Richardson. 
Even when the going gets tough, the on-target acting by Berry and Desselle 
is pleasant enough to keep you from dozing off. "B.A.P.S." ain't quite 
C.R.A.P. (oh, come on -- I couldn't resist), but thanks to confused 
storytelling, it comes a little too close to banality. </P>
