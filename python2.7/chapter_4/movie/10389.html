<PRE>Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>Review by Chris Meadows
Review Rating: 9 out of 10</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Roger Spottiswoode
Written by Bruce Feirstein</PRE>
<P>Starring Pierce Brosnan, Jonathan Pryce, Michelle Yeoh, Terri Hatcher,
et al.</P>
<PRE>MPAA: PG-13</PRE>
<P>>From that first magical moment when the spotlight sweeps across the
black screen and James Bond turns and fires, accompanied by that
oh-so-familiar musical sting, "Tomorrow Never Dies" delivers the kind
of Bondian punch that was sadly lacking in "Goldeneye".  The 18th
official Bond franchise film, not counting "Never Say Never Again,"
brings us fully back to the old familiar Bondian formula, a formula
which has been sadly lacking in recent Bond movies.  And it brings in
a few _new_ tricks as well.</P>
<P>As far as the storyline is concerned, TND owes a lot to past Bond
films.  As in "Moonraker" and "The Spy Who Loved Me," Bond runs into
and must work with an agent from a foreign intelligence outfit with
whom the British Secret Service normally competes.  Also as in "The
Spy Who Loved Me," the villain plans to use assaults on naval military
vessels to play both Britain and the foreign power du jour, China, off
against each other, starting a war by attacking the military forces of
both sides.  However, in a uniquely '90s twist on the old James Bond
formula, the villain, Elliot Carver (played with panache by Jonathan
Pryce) doesn't want to rule the world, or kill everyone in it and
found an empire based on his eugenically-handpicked select few.  He
just wants the media rights.</P>
<P>This film, more than any other Bond film in at least the last ten
years, is a Bond devotee's delight.  There are literally dozens of
scenes harking back to Bond movies of the past.  The guns.  The girls.
The gadgets.  The vodka martinis.  The supercar (a BMW this time,
thanks to the magic of product placement, though the old Astin Martin
does make a brief appearance).  The chase scenes, including the
occasional jaw-dropping stunt.  The heavily-guarded-and-beweaponed
enemy stronghold to be stormed.  The pre-credit opening gambit.  The
venerable Desmond Llewellyn, once again on hand as the venerable Major
Boothroyd, more commonly known in the movies simply as Q, who once
more gets to tell Bond to "grow up".  (Funny how Bond keeps getting
younger and younger, and Q keeps getting older and older...)  All the
things that keep the Bond movies a working franchise are _all there_.
Even the good old original Monty Norman James Bond theme makes
repeated appearances in the soundtrack, after being absent from the
last several films.</P>
<P>Many people are prone to knock films for being "formulaic."  In many
cases, they're right.  Formula can be the deathknell of many a film,
due to Hollywood's habit of jumping on a bright new idea and wringing
every last penny out of it, and beating the dead horse until it
resembles finely-ground chuck.  (Witness "Home Alone," and the endless
parade of clones and sequels it has inspired.)  However, with Bond
films, "formula" has meant something else--in the Bond films' heyday
at least, it was a near-guarantee of some good, solid entertainment.</P>
<P>When the Bond franchise first began, it broke new ground for both the
science-fiction _and_ the action genres.  It improved over the years,
particularly while Sean Connery was the leading man.  Now, however,
James Bond is no longer the only spy-action movie game in town.  In
order to distinguish itself from all the other action movie games in
town, Bond has stopped trying to reinvent himself as a strict (and
strangely monogamous) action hero, as he had become through the
Timothy Dalton Bond films, and has returned to a more traditional Bond
formula, suitably updated for the '90s.  The appeal of "Tomorrow Never
Dies" to fans of past Bond films may be summed up in just one word:
_nostalgia_.</P>
<P>However, this is not to say that TND is strictly "same old same old"
Bond.  There are some interesting new twists, most notably perhaps the
first Bond girl ever who can fully take care of herself, and is not
simply around to look pretty and be rescued by Bond in time of need.
Michelle Yeoh plays Wai Lin as an almost exact reprise of her
"Inspector Yang" character from "Supercop"--the Communist Chinese
agent who has to work with an agent from the British Empire (in
"Supercop," it was Jackie Chan from Hong Kong) to prevent some great
threat to China.  Michelle even gets a one-on-many fight scene all to
herself, which she handles with great grace and poise, thanks in part
to the Hong Kong stunt crew she brought in to play the bad guys.  When
it comes time to storm the enemy stronghold (in this case a stealth
ship), Michelle's Wai Lin takes her place as an equal partner to
Brosnan's James Bond insofar as ass-kicking and name-taking goes.</P>
<P>How do all the Bond regulars do?  Pierce Brosnan seems to have settled
into the role of Bond, playing him with a kind of spirited panache not
seen since Connery's portrayal of the agent.  Judi Dench plays M in a
dry-witted manner much after the fashion of Bernard Lee's portrayal of
Bond's old boss.  Samantha Bond's Moneypenny is a witty foil to Bond
in the scenes they share, and gets one of the best lines in the entire
film, about James Bond's linguistic skills.  Desmond Llewellyn is
inimitably Q, though at his age, surely he won't be for very much
longer.  Even Joe Don Baker is back for two scenes, reprising his
Felix Leiterish role of Wade, Bond's liason with the CIA.</P>
<P>As for the villains and the bit players, they are mostly also to the
film's credit.  Elliot Carver (played by Jonathan Pryce) is a
wonderful evil mastermind, harking back to the Blofeld/Goldfinger
school of villains--the kind who are megolomaniacal and aren't afraid
to show it while explaining precisely what they plan to do and how
they plan to do it.  He chews the scenery in grand style, and carries
off the villain's part with a wonderfully evil flair.  Gotz Otto plays
Stamper, the consummate henchman, who is more than up to the task of
giving Bond a hard time.</P>
<P>The bit players are mostly unremarkable; they come on screen, they
speak their parts, they (for the most part) die.  Vincent Schiavelli
renders a brief but interesting turn as Dr. Kaufman, a hit man who
just happens also to be a forensic doctor and pistol marksman.  Terri
Hatcher, the film's "other" Bond girl, is the only bad part in the
film; supposedly an old flame of Bond's, she is nonetheless so flat
that we the audience have a hard time figuring out just how James Bond
could have fallen for such an uninteresting person.  This also seems
to conflict with the established history of Bond as having only ever
loved one woman in his entire life (from "On Her Majesty's Secret
Service").  Fortunately, Miss Hatcher's role in the film is rather
abbreviated compared to the far more interesting and vital Michelle
Yeoh's.</P>
<P>It seems that director Roger Spottiswoode, or someone on the film's
production staff, is a fan of Hong Kong movies.  Michelle Yeoh's
inclusion as a very similar character to her "Supercop" portrayal is
one clue, but there are other little borrowed touches of note.  At one
point, Bond dives onto a mechanic's creeper and lets it carry him
through a door, keeping him low to avoid enemy fire--rather like Chow
Yun-Fat did in "A Better Tomorrow."  At several points, Bond and
Wai-Lin fire simultaneously from guns held in both hands, another Hong
Kong film trademark.  These little touches are just another example of
how Hong Kong cinema, the latest new wave to sweep across the western
cinematic horizon, is revitalizing western action movies in general.
TND also benefits from a nicely satirical wit, taking the opportunity
to poke fun at a variety of subjects, from Microsoft to cable
deregulation to President Clinton to car commercials to the media.</P>
<P>The storyline of "Tomorrow Never Dies," as stated before, borrows from
prior Bond films.  There are also scenes that are _very_ familiar,
also being prior Bond retreads.  We've seen Bond scuba-swim through a
sunken ship filled with dead bodies in "For Your Eyes Only."  We've
seen him play with gadgets and make witty one-liners about them in
_many_ Bond films, and the assault on the villain's floating fortress
of doom is familiar as well.  We've seen many of these things before.</P>
<P>Bond detractors will sneer and say, "So?  Why watch them again, then?"
For Bond fans, however, I suspect this will be much like meeting a
long-lost friend after a long time of separation.  It's the _formula_
that makes Bond movies Bond movies, and the minor variations that make
them worth watching individually.  Forget the line at the end of the
credits crawl that says "JAMES BOND WILL RETURN."  He has already, and
he was _long_ overdue.</P>
