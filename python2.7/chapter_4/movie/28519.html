<P>Let's say you love films where cops chase super-intelligent criminals but
skipped Hannibal because of the unnecessary gore.  Along comes Along Came a
Spider to quench your insatiable thirst for that particular genre.  The
trouble is that the genre has been rubbed into the ground, leaving Spider a
silly, clichéd disappointment.  The only thing startling about the film's
well-telegraphed "surprises" is how incredibly predictable they are,
especially if you've seen Kiss the Girls, which, like Spider, was based on a
James Patterson novel and stars Morgan Freeman as the same protagonist
detective (he's this film's executive producer, as well).</P>
<P>First things first.  Spider was the first of six novels Patterson wrote that
feature Dr. Alex Cross as a main character.  Kiss was the second book, which
technically makes Spider a prequel (the film never addresses this
meaningless point).  The parallels between the two films are staggering,
making Spider seem almost like a remake of Girls.  The crimes are similar,
the criminals are similar, and the twist at the end is, well, just about
identical.</P>
<P>This time around, Cross is on the trail of a madman who has kidnapped the
daughter of a U.S. Senator (a la Silence of the Lambs) from an
ultra-exclusive D.C. school complete with a limousine drop-off area, giant
flat-screen monitors on every desk and a gaggle of Secret Service agents to
protect the students.  The madman - one Gary Soneji (Michael Wincott, Before
Night Falls) - poses as a teacher (complete with instantly suspicious makeup
and prosthetics) for two years and makes off with little Megan Rose (Mika
Boorem, The Patriot) right under the noses of the agents hired to keep an
eye on her.</P>
<P>Cross (Freeman, Nurse Betty), who has been off the job for eight months
following the death of his partner, is dragged into the manhunt by Soneji,
who feels Cross is the only person intelligent enough to accurately convey
his own genius to the media.  Soneji calls Cross at home, using one of those
voice-altering devices to make his voice lower (like Wincott's already
gravelly voice needs to be lower - it's less intelligible than Brad Pitt in
Snatch), and, before you know it, it's off to the cliché races.  The only
one Spider doesn't use is the one where the killer jumps up after you think
he/she is dead.  They even crib the phone booth scavenger hunt scene from
Die Hard With a Vengeance.</P>
<P>Soneji purposely leaves a trail of clues that only Cross can decode, despite
the presence of hundreds of specially trained Federal agents (it's almost as
lame as Denzel Washington doing the same thing from a hospital bed in The
Bone Collector).  You know it won't be long before Cross is taking a mere
ten seconds to correctly guess an important computer password, and be
prepared to hear lines like "I think he's trying to tell us something," or
"He's playing some kind of game."  Holy déjà vu, Batman.  Freeman can keep
saying the same lines until he's blue in the face, but he'll never be as
cool as his Detective William Somerset in Se7en.</P>
<P>Head Over Heels' Monica Potter plays Jezzie Flannigan, the remorseful
Special Agent who was assigned to protect Megan, and she buddies up with
Cross to help find Soneji (the film jettisons the romance the two characters
share).  Potter has never looked and sounded more like Julia Roberts than
she does here, but considering the fact you can't spit without hitting a
photograph or print story about Roberts, it's almost refreshing.  Jay O.
Sanders is the only other recurring character from the first film.</P>
<P>Spider was directed by Lee Tamahori (The Edge) and adapted from Patterson's
novel by first-timer Marc Moss.  While I was glad the running time was kept
in check (it only seemed like two-plus hours), I secretly wished the film
contained a lot more forensic hokum.  Worst of all is Jerry Goldsmith's
(Hollow Man) score, which is about as grating as a shouting match between
Fran Drescher and Janice from Friends.</P>
