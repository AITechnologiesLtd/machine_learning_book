<PRE>                              LAST RESORT
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>It's hard to imagine a more horrific modern-day nightmare.  A young and
wide-eyed Russian lass named Tanya (Dina Korzun) flies to Britain with
her young son Artiom (Artiom Strelnikov) on the promise that her British
fiancée will pick them up from the airport and whisk them off to a new
and happy life together in the West.</P>
<P>When hubby-to-be doesn't show up, Tanya declares herself a refugee to
avoid being immediately sent back to Moscow, then finds herself
imprisoned in an urban gulag -- actually an abandoned seaside resort
with roller coasters and video arcades that's been converted to a
refugee camp.</P>
<P>Everything is difficult in the "resort."  Simply making a telephone call
involves long waits and convoluted instructions, gangs and duplicity
lurk around every corner, and the local fried fish turns out to be just
batter.  With no money and nowhere to go to earn any, Tanya gets
involved with the local pornographer (Lindsey Honey -- a real-life king
of British porn), and we feel she's pretty much scraping bottom.</P>
<P>Luckily, Tanya is befriended by Alfie (the very entertaining Paddy
Considine, A Room for Romeo Brass), the local arcade manager, who takes
the Russian duo under his wing.  What results is a tiny romance, held
together with a story about compassion and perseverance.</P>
<P>Written and directed by the Polish Pawel Pawlikowski, the film is
somewhat autobiographical and is extremely apt in its storytelling
ability.  While the resort itself is relatively benign, Pawlikowski
imbues it with a subtle horror through creepy set designs that connote a
carnival funhouse and washed-out lighting that turns everything
greenish.  Korzun lets us truly feel her struggle, emoting with a
brilliance rarely seen in Hollywood.</P>
<P>Altogether, Last Resort is a small movie, with simple themes and a
running time slightly longer than your typical episode of ER.  However,
it carries far more power than any old TV show -- and most other movies,
to boot.</P>
