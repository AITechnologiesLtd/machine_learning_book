<P>Every once in a while comes the standard 'run off the mill' movie. It's
purpose is to tell a simple story, put in some action and comedy, a little
romance and drama, and give the star something to do. The Generals Daughter
is 1999's run off the mill movie. Travolta, looking fat and sweaty, plays
Paul Brenner, who is called in to investigate a gruesome rape and murder
case. The victim (Leslie Stefanson) happens to be the daughter of a general
(Cromwell) who is planning to run for presidency. Brenner, and rape
investigator Sara Sunhill (Stowe) try to find out who raped and murdered
her, starting with shifty suspect Robert Moore (James Woods.)</P>
<P>Simon West, who brought us the standard action movie in the form of Con Air,
moves onto standard thriller with this. All the elements are there: a shifty
suspect played a well known character actor, suspenseful music, and
naturally a 'thrilling' twist. Unfortunately, The Generals Daughter performs
these elements a little lazier than most other films. Although there's
action, it's not particularly exciting. The music is way to loud during
scenes that should be played quiet. The twist is largely obvious, and James
Woods doesn't get nearly enough screen time to make much of a villain. The
cliched predictability of it all makes a rather boring time for the
audience, which isn't what a thriller should be doing.</P>
<P>The cast go through the motions, looking forward for the pay cheque at the
end. Travolta is obviously doing this for the money, and it must be
embarrassing to have this film on his C.V along with Get Shorty and Pulp
Fiction (and, er, Michael.) He also puts on one of the most atrocious
southern accents heard in western cinema. Madeline Stowe, who hasn't had
some good work for ages, was obviously getting late for the rent payments,
and again just seems to be in this film for the money. James Cromwell delive
rs a performance so average, it's impossible to believe this is the same guy
from the excellent L.A Confidential. And James Woods is suitably over the
top as the suspect, but just disappears from the story. The actors all have
that pained, distant look that plagues every 'run off the mill' movie.</P>
<P>The script, written by Christopher Bertolini and, bizarrely, William
Goldman, is abysmal, and leads largely to the films downfall. Some of the
lines uttered are absolutely hideous, especially during the scene where the
two leads are searching through the victims house. The plot chunders on in
it's predictable way, pulling off virtually no surprises. The film sometimes
gets surprisingly brutal for no apparent reason. And the denouement is so
disappointing, it almost made me cry due to it's poorness (and I didn't shed
a tear throughout E.T.)</P>
<P>The Generals Daughter is no classic, but it's no Burn Hollywood Burn either.
It's slightly boring, deeply flawed, but it's slickly produced. Although not
really worth paying for, The Generals Daughter is perfect television
entertainment: it fills two hours and won't trouble the brain. But Travolta
really should have aimed higher.</P>
