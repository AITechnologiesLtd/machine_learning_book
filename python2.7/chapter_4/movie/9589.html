<P>L.A. Confidenial is a rare bird indeed: a modern American crime epic with
great acting, a great script, great direction and a great look to boot. How
many films these days can you say such a thing about these days? The old
saying that 'they don't make them like they used to' can really be put to
the test here.</P>
<P>Director Curtis Hanson is not the sort of filmmaker who would normally be
associated with this sort of movie - best known for his escapist films such
as The Hand That Rocked the Cradle and The River Wild (which costarred
Confidential's David Strathairn), Hanson managed to get enough street cred
to be able to risk making a film which could finally launch him to the
Hollywood A-list.</P>
<P>A risk because L.A. Confidential doesn't have what one would consider bona
fide movie stars, in the U.S., at least - Kevin Spacey, while being an
Oscar winner and having a sizable cult following, has never proven that he
can open a film; Russell Crowe, while an award-winning actor for his
Australian films Proof and Romper Stomper (which managed to make headlines
by creating controversy because of its racist characters), has had a
Hollywood career which so far been less than successful; and Guy Pearce,
the former soapy heartthrob who only came to international prominence with
The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert and who seemed to be
destined afterwards to a life of more Australian films (the gender-swapping
comedy Dating the Enemy, for example) and television series (The Man From
Snowy River).</P>
<P>Hanson, then, should definately be applauded for managing to overcome the
obvious difficulties he would have had in securing such a risky cast and
succeeding. Casting two little known, non-American actors in a major
Hollywood picture is almost unheard of, but hopefully we'll be seeing more
of it in the future after this film. "No stars, just talent," indeed.</P>
<P>Bud White (Crowe) is a firey young cop who acts before he thinks, beats up
on men who beat up on women and is fiercely loyal to his comrades,
especially when he's pressured into giving evidence to an inquiry when he
and his partner Dick Strensland (Graham Beckel) are photographed beating
into a group of Mexican prisoners suspected of assailing a couple of
policemen.</P>
<P>White's polar opposite is Ed Exley (Pearce), a by-the-book college boy who
doesn't mind creating a few enemies if it can further his career. After
spilling the beans on the beating, he becomes a Detective Lieutenant and
becomes second-in-command behind police captain Dudley Smith (the brilliant
James Cromwell) in a murder investigation which runs far deeper than either
he or White could imagine.</P>
<P>The entire cast (which also includes Danny De Vito, Kim Basinger and
another former Australian soap star, Simon Baker Denny) are terrific, but
special mention must of course go to Crowe, Pearce and Spacey (as Jack
Vincennes, another cop who gets caught up in the investigation) for their
exceptional performances.</P>
<P>Hanson proves that he is definately a force to be reckoned with as a
director. He has made a modern classic with this film, one that can very
admirably stand alongside the films from the 40s and 50s. See it.</P>
<PRE>5 stars.</PRE>
