<PRE>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
4 stars</PRE>
<P>In a country of millions, it's easy to feel insignificant.  In a colony
of billions, it's even easier.</P>
<P>The animation gurus from Dreamworks, including Tim Johnson - who
transformed Homer Simpson into 3D - have taken the standards of computer
generation up a few notches with Antz.  They zoom in and out, and up and
around the huge world of these tiny creatures, giving amazing detail to
items as ordinary as a soft drink can.</P>
<P>Z (voice of Woody Allen) feels that he has had a less than satisfying
childhood - receiving minimal attention from his mother, since he is the
middle child in a family of five million.  Living and working in a
colony which follows strict routine, Z struggles to find his own self
amongst a society that discourages individualism.  Quite a complex theme
to explore in a family film, really, but that just makes it all the
better.</P>
<P>Antz never fails to keep a consistently high level of entertainment,
with the obvious visuals but, less obviously, some fabulous dialogue
that both adults and children can get a lot out of.  Woody Allen was an
absolutely perfect choice for his role, giving Z a lovable and quirky
tone, sounding exactly right on every occasion. Sharon Stone plays
Princess Bala, Z's love interest who is predictably disgusted by him at
first. Meanwhile, Sylvester Stallone also sounds perfect as Z's macho
buddy, with a good heart.</P>
<P>As we all know, there has to be a bad guy; this time it's General
Mandible (Gene Hackman), a power crazed evil ant who hatches a plot to
kill all the workers and start a new colony.  I would have liked to see
Custer developed a little more since he's so fun to watch, but then
again, so is everyone.</P>
<P>The three screenwriters and two directors have made the tale a heroic
one, but not before examining Z's nervous mind.  Once we have a good
idea of what makes him tick, Z's adventures begin and the film starts to
unwind its carefully executed climax.  Which, in every sense of the
word, is terrifically exciting and certainly a benchmark in atmospheric
animated sequences.</P>
<P>The quality of viewing in Antz is rich and illustrious, bringing to life
a whole new world of huge proportions.  Not so much a storm in a tea
cup, but perhaps an epic from an ant.  And if it does become that - an
epic - it would be one of the more justified successes of recent years,
with strong human values and an inspirational story line.  In short,
Antz contains everything that makes an excellent film excellent and,
whilst it doesn't completely blow you away, it's probably the best
family movie so far this year (it's only contender being Mouse Hunt).</P>
<P>I at least speak for myself when I say that I definitely wouldn't mind a
break from Sliding Paltrows, rampaging lizards and frowning Bruce
Willis'.  Z can beat the pants off all of 'em.</P>
