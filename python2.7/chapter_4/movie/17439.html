 Central Station (1998) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Fernanda Montenegro
and Vinicius De Oliveira</PRE>
<PRE> Dora is a cynical, unhappy spinster.</PRE>
<P> A former teacher, she now earns her living writing letters for those who
cannot write.</P>
<P> She works at a table at Rio de Janeiro's Central Station, where she judges
those for whom she writes.</P>
<P> Sometimes she mails their letters, other times she merely tears them up
and throws them away.</P>
<P> Dora has a disdain for people and is not above taking advantage of them.</P>
<P> But all this changes for Dora when through circumstances she is forced to
be responsible for Josue, a young boy whose mother is killed in the street
in front of the station.</P>
<P> This is the simple set up for Central Station, a heart-tugging story from
Brazil.</P>
<P> Dora (Academy Award-nominee Fernanda Montenegro) at first is reluctant to
befriend Josue (Vinicius De Oliveira).</P>
<P> She even tries to profit from his misfortune by selling him to a sleazy
"adoption agency," but relents and instead determines to take the child to
his father in the remote northeast section of Brazil.</P>
<P> Central Station is more of a character study than a plot-driven movie. It
derives its impetus from the growing relationship between its two
characters as they travel by bus and trucks to reach their frontier
destination.</P>
<P> And even though you have some sense where the film is headed, the journey
remains a pleasant one.</P>
<P> For Central Station totally involves you in its characters.</P>
<P> Montenegro's performance is masterful. She takes what could have been a
cliched character and gives her life and depth. She shows the conflict
within this woman who cannot even explain to herself why she is slowly
becoming a surrogate mother for a young boy whom she at first detested.</P>
<P> The growing love between the woman and the child develops slowly through
argument, tears and humor.</P>
<P> As Josue, young De Oliveira is a natural, seemingly unaffected by the camera.</P>
<P> What truly makes Central Station a memorable experience is its heart. It
proves that there is goodness in even the most displaced and lost among us,
even if they themselves do not know it is there.</P>
