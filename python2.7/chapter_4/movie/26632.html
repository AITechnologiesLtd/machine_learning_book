<P>In recent times, I cannot remember a film by a first-rank maker 
creating as much controversy as "Dr. T." Its reception runs from 
admiration to vilification. The title's doctor is a Dallas, Texas 
gynecologist whose clientele are chic, wealthy, idle,  upper-class 
ladies. They all love him, as does his large staff. His popularity is 
immense --for good reasons.</P>
<P>He is clearly a very good OB-GYN.. His interest in his patients is 
extraordinary,  personal, sincere as well as intelligent. Though 
overworked he is also patient with the patients. And if the women 
love him, he loves them back.  And he looks like Richard Gere.</P>
<P>The ladies, from young to old, mostly know one another or are 
friends, practice air kissing on occasion, fill his waiting room to 
capacity, chat and gossip among themselves, request Dr. T  with 
persistance, keep him non-stop busy. The women are all nice looking, 
some even beautiful, .Janine Turner is spectacular. But, cleverly, 
none of those ladies is shown as a vamp.</P>
<P>The place is like a women's club. It's also bedlam where T and his 
fantastically good staff manage to keep their heads above water, 
their cool, their genuine smiles, and their humanity.</P>
<P>The whole scene is as Altmanesque as can be. The director juggles 
characters, dialogue (overlapping, synchronized, credible), images 
and action with his usual, impressive skill. The viewer may be kept 
busy following things and people, but there's clarity and method in 
this madness.</P>
<P>One might normally suspect that within this framework are affairs 
between T and "his" women. But the catch is that Dr.T worships and 
deifies women, calls them saints, respects them even at their 
nuttiest, and is crazy about his own wife Kate (Farrah Fawcett) whom 
he has always pampered.</P>
<P>In such films the overall atmosphere and numerous characters can be 
more important and interesting than the main story line. Here the 
start has a magnificently roving camera that  follows Dallas ladies 
through an upscale Dallas mall -- ironically, critically but not 
cattily. It's an A-plus sequence in which a Tiffany's and other 
elegant sites are like a fine orchestral score.</P>
<P>At the mall Kate behaves oddly, takes off her clothes and dances in a 
pool.  Back in the Travis home, she refuses her husband's sexual 
advances.  "We can't do this any more. It's not nice."  She is 
diagnosed as suffering from a Hestia Complex. In ancient Greece, 
Hestia, goddess of the hearth, pursued by Apollo and Poseidon decided 
to be a virgin forever. The complex--assuming it exists -- is caused 
by too much male love and attention and results in a retreat to a 
child-like state. The subject despises, then rejects love.</P>
<P>That's the kernel of the plot. With Kate apparently not quickly 
curable, Dr.T  distracts himself a bit by continuing to meet his 
buddies for golf and hunting. He meets the new assistant golf coach 
Bree (Helen Hunt). Writ as large as a sky-writing plane's message is 
an affair, predictable yet handled with some originality.</P>
<P>The film, orchestrated as well a choreographed, thickens with the 
themes of T's grown-up daughters, one a guide for a Conspiracy Museum 
(on JFK's assassination), the other a pretty-by-the-numbers 
cheerleader who is about to be married.</P>
<P>Other ingredients are thrown into the sauce gradually. Kate;  wedding 
preparations; T's head-nurse (Shelly Long) who is in love with him; 
weird patients; lesbianism; an outdoor wedding ceremony attended by a 
20 to 1 ratio of women to men--in stormy weather; much else. I will 
not disclose the film's progress, surprises, its peculiar last parts, 
and the shocking (to some) ending which is upbeat and a kind of 
epiphany for Dr. T.  I can't say more.</P>
<P>All this has fine, precise acting by all. Gere who bears the main 
load, plays quietly and discreetly. The movie also has originality, 
imagination, creativity and a host of clever bits. In one, a 
chain-smoking patient  whom T allows exceptionally to smoke during 
her examination. Then he's had enough and hands the ashtray to a 
nurse... who disposes of it but not before taking one puff behind T's 
back.</P>
<P>There is also a plethora of filmic and non-filmic in-jokes and 
references, gratuitous, often elusive, but amusing.  Dr. T's name is 
Sullivan Travis, which recalls the great 1941 comedy by Preston 
Sturges, "Sullivan's Travels."  Behind the pool where Kate dances 
nude is a Godiva store. The storm in the last part of the film seems 
to wink at the Helen Hunt-starring "Twister" (1996). Hunt's name Bree 
is like Jane Fonda's in "Klute" (1971). Jokes are made about Brie the 
cheese, though this movie is not cheesy. And much else.</P>
<P>The main objection to this work is Robert Altman's alleged misogyny. 
It is true that hardly any women look really intelligent here but the 
few men don't either, and that's not unusual in movies today. True, 
few of the women are not charmers, but in the small roles of T's 
assistants and especially Shelley Long's, they are. . (Hunt has 
charms for Gere but  there's a twist )  Yes, the ladies are from 
Dallas (though few sound like Texans) as are the girls in the 
discreetly ludicrous cheerleading class, but they could have been in 
many other wealthy cities.</P>
<P>All this reminds me of an interview with Clint Eastwood who said that 
he did not expect his "Unforgiven" to be a hit. "It's too 
intelligent." .</P>
