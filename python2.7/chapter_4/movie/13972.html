Detective Story (Reviewed on Aug. 19th/98)</PRE>
<P>Starring Kirk Douglas, William Bendix, Lee Grant</P>
<P>Kirk Douglas is one of those rare American actors who can say more with a
simple glance than most can say with pages of dialogue.  All he has to do
is look at someone with a raised eyebrow, and you instantly know what he's
thinking.</P>
<P>"Detective Story" features one of Kirk Douglas's finest performances.  He
stars as a New York detective that has his whole world fall apart in one
night.  The film is based on a play, and this is quite evident, as most of
the movie takes place in the one-room flat that the detective's work in.</P>
<P>The film opens with the Douglas character getting ready to go home to his
wife, but through a series of events, he never quite makes it there.  The
bulk of the movie follows the case of a man named Schneider, a surgeon who
routinely performs abortions with a high fatality rate.  However, this
Schneider character has a connection in the past of Douglas's wife; a
connection Douglas himself is not aware of.  Many secrets are revealed in
the last half hour of this film.  Secrets I would not dream of giving
away. </P>
<P>With a name like "Detective Story", one would assume the film would
resemble an episode of "NYPD Blue", but it doesn't quite work out that
way.  However, we do see Douglas at work on a few other cases throughout
the running time.  Lee Grant (virtually unrecognizable) plays a meek
Jewish woman arrested for shoplifting.  Her scenes with Bendix, another
detective, provide the movie with a few laughs.</P>
<P>The performances all around are fantastic.  Douglas may be the leader of
this ensemble, but he's not the center of attention all the time.  We get
to catch a glimpse into other cases and other detectives working on those
cases.</P>
<P>Which brings me back to Douglas.  He has a really emotional scene towards
the end of the picture that really makes you feel for him.  We can see
that this is a man who has spent his whole life trying to eliminate crime,
but has finally realized that what he's really done is gotten back at his
criminal father.  How he handles coming to terms with this is something
really worth seeing.</P>
<P>Kirk Douglas is the kind of actor we don't seem to see to much of these
days:  He's a tough guy, but the human elements are never hidden too
deeply underneath that gruff exterior.</P>
