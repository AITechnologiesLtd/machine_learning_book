<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>        I have a soft spot in my heart for pure, amoral sleaze.  I liked
Showgirls (there, I said it).  I typically enjoy myself when sitting
through that Eszterhaz, sex-filled cinematic tabloid-ish trash.  Wild
Things is the best sleazy film I've ever seen.  It's filled with great
performances, graphic sex, three-way sex, rape charges, double-crosses,
plot twists, genitalia of all genders, graphic violence, death, witty
humor, and, best of all, Denise Richards.</P>
<P>        Criticizing this film for being disgusting, raucous, and just plain
wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing Citizen Kane for
being disturbing, or Titanic for being lofty and epic.  Wild Things is a
film that succeeds in its endeavors, but I don't just admire it for
this--I admire it for being so entertaining and such a fun time at the
movies.  I must admit up-front, however, that I am directly in the
center of the age group to which this film has been engineered to
appeal.  I imagine that this shows.</P>
<P>        It's hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces that
shouldn't be known.  I thought I had the whole thing worked out from the
trailer, but I was wrong; there are a lot of turns here.  I'll just say
that the film takes place in Blue Bay, a rich little town in Florida. 
In Blue Bay lives Sam Lombardo (Matt Dillon), a teacher who is accused
of rape by two of his students, Kelly Van Ryan (Denise Richards), and
Suzie Toller (Neve Campbell).  Kelly's mother, Sandra (Theresa Russell),
immediately presses charges.  </P>
<P>        All of this happens fairly early in the film.  And right up until this
point, I had the whole film predicted.  I was wrong, though, and every
time I was proven wrong, I was shocked.  Wild Things isn't even remotely
plausible, but it is so fun to see where the story takes us that the
implausibility of every scene is meaningless, and often invited, just
for kicks.    </P>
<P>        I remember first seeing the preview for Wild Things before The
Replacement Killers.  I'd give the preview four stars.  It made me want
to see the movie so much that I've been waiting for it anxiously ever
since.  Over the past few weeks though, I started to realize that there
was no way the film could live up to the preview (see Independence Day);
thankfully, I was proven wrong.  The preview for this film is one that
needs to be studied by marketing analysts of every distribution
company:  not only does it make us want to see the film, but it doesn't
give away any of the secrets.</P>
<P>        But I'm not here to talk about the preview.  I'm here to talk about
Denise Richards.  Now, I found her mildly interesting in Starship
Troopers, but in Wild Things she appeals to such a base instinct that
every scene she's in demands attention in a way that almost no other
performer can.  Of course, this might have something to do with her
oceanic eyes...and flawless body...but I thought she did a great job
acting, too (stop laughing).  No, Richards is truly a find--she is
talented, and always convincing in this film.  This mixed in with her
insane physical appeal makes her a vital asset to any film she may grace
in the future.  </P>
<P>        The other actors are good, too.  Dillon is as suave as ever (it's nice
to see him bouncing back from Albino Alligator and In & Out).  Bacon
does a good job acting all determined and stuff as a sex crimes
officer.  Neve Campbell gives the most layered performance of all of
them, though I won't pretend that any of these characters are deep and
complex.  For a plot like this to work, all of these people have to be
insane and basically contrived.  </P>
<P>        That's okay, because director John McNaughton knows that he's making a
self-consciously wicked film.  Each scene--even the three-way sex
scene--is observed with hilarity by McNaughton, and the result is a
sleaze-fest that's too smart to resist.  There isn't an inconsistent
moment in Wild Things:  every bit of it is alluring garbage, so trashy
it's funny, and so entertaining it's painful.  I loved it.</P>
