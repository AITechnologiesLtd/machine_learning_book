<P>At the 1993 Cannes Film Festival, "The Snapper" came as a relaxing break
from often long, sometimes solemn --albeit good-- big films. A "small"
movie made for BBC-TV, it was an instant crowd-and-critics pleaser and
confirmed the saying that often "less is more."</P>
<P>The 1991 film "The Commitments", about  young working-class Dubliners who
form a band that plays older soul music, had been  scripted by
schoolteacher Roddy Doyle from his own novel, the first of his Barrytown (a
fictional Dublin area) trilogy.  The other two books were "The Snapper" and
"The Van." Published soon after "Snapper-the-novie" came out, Doyle's
"Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha" also got much attention.  The writer  is no longer
a teacher, but his loquacious texts and scripts continue  to educate us
about the  gifts of the Irish, including the gift of gab.</P>
<P>"The Snapper" gets down to brass tacks while  you're still trying to settle
in your seat. In the Curley  home, 20-year old Sharon (Tina Kellegher), a
supermarket clerk,  the senior of six children, still unmarried, announces
to her parents with no preamble that she's going to have a snapper (Irish
for baby, kid, squirt). What would usually call for horrified or moralistic
reactions, or turn into high drama, falls on exceptionally tolerant and
sympathetic ears.</P>
<P>Although Sharon stubbornly refuses to reveal who the father is, there is no
pressure, no coercion from Dad Dessie (Colm Meany) and Mom Kay
(RuthMcCabe). Right away they close protective ranks around Sharon. Within
minutes Dessie states that he needs a drink  to recover from the shock ...
and invites Sharon to join him at the pub.</P>
<P>The Curleys are a high-spirited,  tightly-knit family. They live piled up
in a small semi-detached house but put up with the congestion through
patience, humor and bits of eccentricity.  When Junior Sister practices
baton-twirling in a garish, cardboard uniform, Dad asks her about her white
beard. "Shaving foam" replies the child. "Ah" says Dessie, and lets it go
at that.</P>
<P>Dad's life seems to be one of trips between home and pub, with endless talk
in both. He imbibes generously with his companions, all regulars. Sharon
and  her girlfriends also have their table there. In times when, especially
in North America, younger and older people hardly ever mix, it is
wonderful, heart-warming to see different generations coming together!</P>
<P>Sharon and her pals come all tarted up in heavy makeup, coiffures and
outfits that are presumably sexy in the eyes of the males of their social
class. Their entertaining  gossip is, of course, mostly about men. Jolly,
caustic comments are delivered with gales of laughter, whinnies and
giggles. It is a perfect reproduction of a certain milieu.</P>
<P>Without missing a beat, Sharon announces her pregnancy to her companions,
as Dad does to his.  Everyone understands and sympathizes.
Language-consciousness being a quintessentially Irish trait --and treasure
--  the pubsters turn everything into a maelstrom of words generally
enhanced by expletives. In their mouths, the latter are not four-letter
vulgarities but linguistic elements of  style.</P>
<P>Not that the locals' vocabulary lacks standards. "Uterus" shocks Dessie;
Sharon ridicules the maternity nurse for asking about her menstrual history
("why couldn't she say period?") and for saying "movements" instead of
you-know-what.</P>
<P>Sharon has fleeting moments of despondence, but her plain, potatoish face
mostly reflects an indomitable joie de vivre. For good reason too. Greater
Dublin must have half a million inhabitants, but the Curleys are the
particular citizens of a few hundred square meters  where everyone knows
everyone else -- and initially almost all are friendly to Sharon.</P>
<P>When, however, the father of the snapper is tentatively revealed ( I will
not point him out and spoil your discovery) there is an abrupt reversal of
fortune. Sharon loses the outsiders' support, is mocked and called names.
As a red herring, she concocts a story  in  surreally absurd terms about a
one-night stand with a Spanish sailor. Few are inclined to believe it, but
a least the tall tale adds more humor to the situation.</P>
<P>All backing is not lost though.  Sharon's best friend, the stalwart Jackie,
stands by her and laughter goes on during outrageous moments.  Dad,
becoming increasingly closer to his pregnant daughter, shows far much more
interest in the coming snapper than in the six previous deliveries by his
sweet, wise and pretty wife.</P>
<P>The Curley  household being bare of print materials -- even newspapers--
Dessie goes out and gets one book, about chilbirth. Entranced by the
mysteries of sex and anatomy, he applies them with his bewildered spouse.</P>
<P>Stephen Frears is known for films like  "The Hit," "My Beautiful
Laundrette" (to which he winks as Dessie's truck passes by a large
Laundrette  sign),"Prick Up Your Ears," "Sammy and Rosie Get Laid,"
"Dangerous Liaisons," "The Drifters," "Hero." Those were bigger, fairly
complicated, sometimes glossy and/or wild pictures. "The Snapper" on the
other hand is a return to the incisive simplicity and the making of
forceful points with concision that were  found in the many Frears  BBC-TV
movies--excellent  but unknown in the U.S.A.</P>
<P>As in most Frears telefilms, "The Snapper" sets up a plain, even
simplistic milieu, zooms in on, and milks its colorful authenticity. With
upbeat  whimsy and humor, the director says a great deal about the people ,
their distinctive culture and life-views.</P>
<P>Cultivated, higher-class spectators may feel some depression or snobbery
vis-a-vis the simple-minded Curleys and their friends, but the film's
vibrant buoyancy sees to it that natural simplicity will overcome raised
eyebrows.</P>
<P>The most un-intellectual "Snapper" is full of funny stuff.  It goes
non-stop through daily events and quirks, idiosyncrasies and affections,
keeps adding good touches. Among them, the sad-sack yet comical
none-too-bright fellow who had impregnated Sharon. He goes from utter
insensitivity to maudliness --then becomes a pariah himself.</P>
<P>Dessie's evolution is a joy to behold. It is hard to  realize that he is
the same Colm Meany who plays  O'Brien in" Star Trek, The Next Generation"
and in" Deep Space Nine," which, pace  the Trekkies, do not exactly strain
expressivity.</P>
