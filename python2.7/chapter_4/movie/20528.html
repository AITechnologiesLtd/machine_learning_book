<P>Hmmm...  Another good movie about a kid seeing ghosts, with a screenplay
written by the director.  Must be that Y2K bug...  Whatever the cause,
this trend of films written and directed by the same person seems to be
a bright ray of hope in current the murk of Hollywood.  The singleness
of vision seems to eliminate the repetitive cliches and allow a
genuinely good film to be created.</P>
<P>While I haven't read the 1958 novel by Richard Matheson that director
David Koepp's screenplay is based on, A STIR OF ECHOES feels like the
perfect on-screen representation of a Matheson novel, duplicating both
his strengths and weaknesses -- that is, a very well-executed story with
an overly-simple plotline.  You know what's going on long before the
characters do and are impatiently waiting for them to figure it out,
however, the film is so well-made that you don't mind knowing what's
going to happen and it's a pleasure to watch it play it out.</P>
<P>As far as its supernatural component goes, the movie has great
atmosphere, but is spooky  rather than scary -- like THE SIXTH SENSE,
it's a ghost story, not a horror movie.  The film makes complicated and
interesting use of the audio track to keep you confused and off-balance,
has good gotchas, and uses its CGI in restrained and effective ways.
Note that the baby-sitter is reading Matheson's THE SHRINKING MAN.</P>
<P>A very enjoyable film, with a lot of humor and little surprises.</P>
