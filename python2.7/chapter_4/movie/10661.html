<PRE>                                KUNDUN
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Martin Scorsese gives us what amounts
          to an encyclopedia article on the Dalai Lama from
          early life until his exile.  The Lama is always
          perfect and never human.  The strongest emotion
          Scorsese gives the Lama or evokes in the audience
          for that matter, is bewilderment at the mysterious
          culture of Tibet.  The film should have taken more
          chances and humanized its subject a little more.
          Rating: 6 (0 to 10), +1 (-4 to +4) Spoiler warning:
          this review will assume the reader has common
          knowledge about the Dalai Lama.
          New York Critics: 11 positive, 1 negative, 7 mixed</PRE>
<P>     Seeing KUNDUN is a lot like reading a good article about the Dalai
Lama and Tibet from the National Geographic.  It has great color
photography and it has a lot of facts.  But it is an appeal more to the
intellect than to the emotions.  And even as an appeal to the intellect
not everything that the viewer sees will be understood.  But neither
what we see, nor what we hear in the dialogue fleshes out the
character.  Director Martin Scorsese would almost have us believe that
there is nothing to the Dalai Lama but a bundle of wise Buddhist
aphorisms.  Like a Magic 8-ball, whenever he is shaken a different wise
response comes floating to the surface.</P>
<P>     The story begins in 1933.  The 13th Dalai Lama is dead and in the
Tibetan tradition scouts have been sent out to find a young boy who is
the new incarnation of the Dalai Lama's soul.  A two-year-old child is
found who seems to be the 14th reincarnation of the Buddha of
Compassion.  The young child's parents are already aware that their son
is special due to favorable omens surrounding the child, but we never
find out what they feel when they have confirmed that their child is,
in fact, a Buddha of Compassion.</P>
<P>     The boy is brought to the magnificent palace embedded in the side
of a mountain, one of the most majestic buildings in all the world.
And to the boy's bewilderment he is immersed in Buddhist wisdom.  Soon
he begins to understand what is going on and begins to speak with the
insight we would expect of the Dalai Lama.  Still, there is much in the
film left intentionally enigmatic for the audience.  In one scene we
have a large hissing dancer performs for the Lama and then slides
across the floor up to the Lama.  The scene ends with no more message
to the viewer than that this obviously means something.  The viewer
begins an outsider at the beginning of the film and remains an outsider
right through to the end.  Then, as if there was not already enough in
the film that is hard to follow, Scorsese adds sequences of his own
visual symbolism. Rather than show us a big unexplained piece of
Tibetan culture, Scorsese would have done better to show us a smaller
sample and explain his understanding of it.  We get a better idea of
who the Dalai Lama is as a person from SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET than we do
from this biography of the Lama.</P>
<P>     As the story progresses, Tibet is invaded by China and the Lama
has to face the implications of the Chinese invasion of his country.
He is brought, a virtual prisoner, to China where he meets with a
surprisingly affable Chairman Mao.  The Chinese leader is apparently a
man who can have a simple peasant charm one moment and order the death
of thousands the next.  Mao politely but firmly threatens the Lama to
cooperate with the Chinese rape of his country.  The Lama appeals to
the world for help, but not surprisingly his pleas are to little avail.
It seems Tibet's natural isolation is a double-edged sword: over the
centuries it has been a natural barrier to invaders, but no military
force in the world will pierce that barrier just for the sake of
altruism.  Eventually the Lama must decide if he will serve his country
best from within or outside its borders.  The film lacks the scope of
history and the human values that the similar GANDHI had.  Gandhi was
made much more a three-dimensional character than the Lama.</P>
<P>     Scorsese tells the story of the Lama with a cast of unknowns, most
of whom are Tibetan amateurs.  They all stand in the right places say
their lines, but there is no passion in the performances.  The
Tibetans' seem as cold and distant as their land.  Melissa Mathison's
screenplay conveys none of the emotion of her writing screenplays for
THE BLACK STALLION and for E.T., THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL.  Roger Deakins
to create a believable Tibet in hues of reds, yellows, and browns.
(The real Tibet being inaccessible, he shot instead in Morocco, British
Columbia, and Idaho.)  Philip Glass provides a score hypnotic in its
repetitious minimalism.  It seems well-suited to the splendor of Tibet
but is perhaps not a rousing as the film needed.</P>
<P>     KUNDUN is like a very sincere tribute to a great man that just
would not come out the way it was intended. The Dalai Lama may well be
a great man, but KUNDUN is not a great film biography.  I rate it a 6
on the 0 to 10 scale and a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
