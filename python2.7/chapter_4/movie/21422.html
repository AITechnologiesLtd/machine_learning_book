Music of the Heart</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Based on the real life of Music teacher Roberta Guaspari and, surprisingly,
directed by horror notable Wes Craven, "Music of the Heart" is an
inspirational story that finds its harmonies not without their share of
dissonant notes.</P>
<P>Her husband out of the picture, house-mom Roberta moves to the inner city to
teach violin at the local elementary school. Burdened at first by the
troubles plaguing inner city kids and then later by budget cuts, Roberta
struggles to keep her violin class and family (two young boys) in tune.</P>
<P>Streep's portrayal of Guaspari is loving, yet refreshingly harsh, "That was
terrible! You're going to make your parents vomit if you don't practice."
The movie has just enough sappy moments already, an angelic teacher would
have made its own audience vomit. Though I like Angela Basset, her
performance as the beautiful hard-nailed principal is (as Guaspari would
say) terrible. As it turns out, her screen time is minimal. While Quinn is
wonderful as the love interest, this film is clearly all about Streep as
Roberta with the kids and the violins. Of course, Streep is supreme. Also,
Cloris Leachman (as her nagging mother) deserves praise. Delivering rather
plainly a total of no more than ten lines, Gloria Estefan's presence (the
supportive colleague) is not much more than a cameo. Both pairs of actors
playing Roberta's two sons (the film jumps to a "ten years later" second
half) do a fine job and are extremely well cast.</P>
<P>Contrived moments seemingly meant to add drama to the picture actually
subtract. For instance, Streep, originally declined a position by Bassett,
returns to the principal's office to show off how well she's taught violin
to her two sons. This is on the sticky edge of excessive sap; but not yet
over it. What should have been a rich scene is lessened by the fact that the
current burnt-out music teacher just happens to be in the office. The violin
playing is followed immediately by the near cliché, "Can't expect too much
from these kids" debate.</P>
<P>On the other hand, half of the 150 violin students appearing in the film are
or were actual students of the real life Guaspari. And seven of the
non-violin-playing child actors took lessons from her in preparation for
their roles.</P>
<P>In the end, living up to it's name, the picture has a lot of heart. If you
could score an excellent film like "Stand and Deliver" for violin blending
in the dissonant overtones of a less-than-excellent one like "Gloria," the
resulting performance would be "Music of the Heart."</P>
