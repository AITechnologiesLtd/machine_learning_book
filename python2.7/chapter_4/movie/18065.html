<PRE>Maximum Risk
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Jean-Claude Van Damme; Natasha Henstridge; Jean-Hugues Anglade;
Zach Grenier & Paul Ben-Victor</P>
<P>Here's a concept -- Jean-Claude Van Damme gets killed within the first ten
minutes of the movie. Now if that isn't enough to get you to finally see a
Van Damme movie, I don't know what is. All sarcasm aside, it is certainly a
different way to start a movie, of course a few minutes later we find out
that the newly deceased had a twin brother -- so lucky us, we get to see
more of Jean-Claude. Van Damme #1 works for the Russian Mafia in the United
States and is killed by some of their operatives. Van Damme #2 is a police
officer in France who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew
about after #1 gets killed in France. The remaining twin (the French cop)
goes to the United States to find out who killed his brother and avenge his
death. Once there, he hooks up with his deceased brother's girlfriend,
played by Natasha Henstridge, and the two of them set out to discover who
the murderers are.</P>
<P>Jean-Claude's acting abilities don't seem to be up to the usual lackluster
standards in this movie. In other words, just in case you missed the
sarcasm, his acting is worse than normal. On the upside, Natasha Henstridge
is in this film, and she does what she did best in Species -- she gets
naked. Sadly, this is probably the high point in the movie. She is actually
a decent actress, but didn't improve as much as I thought she would after
Species.</P>
<P>This is the typical Van Damme movie, with Jean-Claude doing a variety of
high end martial arts moves on his opponents. Nothing new here, and
certainly nothing we haven't seen in every other Van Damme movie. Simply
put, there is absolutely nothing new about this movie. It has a retread
plot -- this isn't the first time Jean-Claude has played twins. He still
can't act. We all saw Natasha's breasts in Species (although this is one
repeat performance I'm not complaining about). This is pretty much like
every movie that Van Damme has ever been involved in -- sub par.</P>
<PRE>4/10</PRE>
