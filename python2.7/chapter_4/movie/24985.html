<P>When English mother Ella Khan (Linda Bassett) calls her offspring, it's 
Meena, Saleem, Maneer, Nazir, Tariq, Sajid, and Abdul. When she calls 
her husband, it's George. This is not the least of the ironies in which 
this sometimes probing, sometimes pratfalling social comedy of the 
English melting pot is steeped.</P>
<P>George Khan (Om Puri of My Son the Fanatic) is a Pakistani who by the 
early '70s when the movie begins has been living in Manchester for many 
years, but who hangs onto his roots like an ironwood on a muddy 
riverbank. He's taken himself out of the old country, but he'll be 
damned if he'll let the old country out of his English-born kids, who 
don't know from Pakistan and could care less. His wife is an English 
lass, but his sons will marry Pakistanis, and he'll do the arranging, 
just like back home. As the story opens, George is preparing to marry 
off his oldest son Nazir (Ian Aspinall) to a Pakistani bride he has 
never met. When Nazir bolts from the altar, George writes him out of the 
family, and clamps down on the rest of his brood.</P>
<P>George is something of a monster, but only when he's crossed, which 
isn't a bad definition of a monster. He's lovable when things are going 
smoothly, and there's a genuine sweetness to the affection between him 
and Ella. But when anyone in his family resists his orders, he becomes 
mean, and worse, violent. He's a terrible hypocrite, his English wife 
and his fish-and-chips shop at odds with his super-Paki prejudice, but 
we're not sure why. If you asked him - as his kids do - he'd clout you.</P>
<P>Yet most of this movie of cultural preservation vs. assimilation in 
prejudice-ridden working-class England is very funny. It's got a knowing 
script, adapted by Ayub Khan-Din from his successful play and mounted by 
first-timer Damien O'Donnell. The ensemble cast defines each of the 
characters distinctly but keeps it a completely credible family, from 
the older kids down to little Sajid (Jordan Routledge), who's so 
confused about his identity that he's always hidden inside the hood of 
his parka like the kid in South Park. And both Puri and Bassett are 
simply wonderful, expert at showing the humanity that is at the root of 
their many contradictions.</P>
<P>O'Donnell does a good job, and gives us a splendid movie, but you can't 
help thinking that with a bit more experience he might have found a way 
to integrate the different moods more seamlessly, and blend the comic 
styles, which range from genuine moments to Richard Lesterian flights of 
madcappery. They make us laugh, but we're not always in the same 
universe.</P>
