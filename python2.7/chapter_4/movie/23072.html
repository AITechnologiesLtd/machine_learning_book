<P>The magic that arises when children across the country listen eagerly to the 
radio after a snowfall to see if school has been canceled for the day is 
brought vibrantly to life in "Snow Day," a mildly entertaining diversion 
that, nonetheless, features at least three stories that do not mesh well when 
strung together, as they are clearly aimed at different age groups. Directed 
by Chris Koch, the film is a valiant effort that will only charm most 
audiences for one-third of the time, based on the viewer's age, and this is 
unfortunate, as the talent to make a truly winning family picture is present 
throughout.</P>
<P>The town of Syracuse is having a disappointing winter, with nary a snow storm 
in sight. But then something unexpected happens in the air pressure and the 
residents awake to find their outside surroundings blanketed in a heavy layer 
of snow. School is announced to be closed for the day, and for some of the 
members of the Brandston family, their lives will be changed--for the 
good--by nightfall. </P>
<P>Story #1 involves teenage son Hal Brandston (Mark Webber), who is infatuated 
with high school beauty Claire Bonner (Emmanuelle Chriqui), and takes finding 
her ankle bracelet as a sign that they were meant for each other. Helping him 
out is his best friend, Lane (Schuyler Fisk), the girl in his life he fails 
to see he is really meant for. Preteens and teenagers are the target audience 
of this story, and it is the sweetest subplot in the film, terribly 
predictable, but consistently entertaining and equipped with a fetching 
innocence. Mark Webber is strong as the protagonist of this tale and the 
narrator of the film, but it is his female counterparts who steal the show. 
Schuyler Fisk, who is Sissy Spacek's daughter, proves that she very well 
could prove to be just as talented an actress as her mother, and is 
absolutely lovely as Lane. And the way in which the Claire character is 
handled is impressive and noteworthy, as she isn't simply written as the 
"seemingly unobtainable object," but as a real person who is charmed by Hal's 
persistence in winning her over. Emmanuelle Chriqui is a fresh face I look 
forward to seeing in the future.</P>
<P>Story #2 is far less successful, and aimed for the ages 5-11 bracket, as 
young Natalie Brandston (Zena Grey) sets out to stop the infamous Snow Plow 
Man (Chris Elliott), a maniacal worker for the city hell-bent on clearing 
each and every street by day's end. Syracuse schools have never been closed 
for snow two days in a row, and Natalie is determined to change that. While 
there are a couple intermittent laughs within this story, it is cliched and 
juvenile, and much of the humor is lame. Chris Elliott has a lot of fun as 
the villainous Snow Plow Man, but Zena Grey, as Natalie, is the type of child 
who rubs me the wrong way. Unctuous and annoyingly loudmouthed, Grey does not 
win any sort of plaudits from me.</P>
<P>Finally, Story #3 deals with the Brandston parents' adventures individually, 
so there  actually could qualify as being a Story #4, as well. Tom Brandston 
(Chevy Chase) is a news weatherman whose boss (Pam Grier) is always insisting 
he dress up in extravagantly silly costumes, in hopes that it will pull in 
viewers, when all Tom wants to do is be taken seriously in his profession as 
a meteorologist. Tom's wife, Laura (Jean Smart), is a workaholic whose job 
takes away from being able to be the involved parent she aspires to be. 
Snowed in and unable to go to work, Laura spends the day with her youngest 
son, and rediscovers why being a parent should come before her job. These 
subplots are tolerable, and a step up from Story #2, but generally slight and 
their payoffs are telegraphed far in advance. In the actor department, Chevy 
Chase is wasted and rarely given a snappy line of dialogue; Pam Grier is 
crazy to have even considered appearing in such a throwaway role; and Jean 
Smart is likable and entertaining.</P>
<P>When all is said and done, "Snow Day" fails because it is so resolutely 
uneven. It is unclear what director Koch was attempting by mixing all of 
these different stories for different ages, unless he was hoping he could 
possibly attract a wider audience and, thus, make more money. He may just 
succeed on that level, in getting them into the theater, but the film itself 
is a strange experience. While keeping an innocuous tone throughout, "Snow 
Day" is unsure what it wants to be, and never firmly finds its footing.</P>
