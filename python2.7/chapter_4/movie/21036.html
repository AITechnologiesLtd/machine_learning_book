<PRE>                               FIGHT CLUB
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<PRE>     The first rule of FIGHT CLUB is `Do not talk about Fight Club.'</PRE>
<PRE>     So I'm breaking the rule.  I figured you'd want to hear about it.</PRE>
<P>     Invoking memories of THE MATRIX, TWELVE MONKEYS, CRASH, and
AMERICAN BEAUTY, FIGHT CLUB has had a lot of hype behind it for close to
a year now.  Is it deserved?  I'm still trying to figure that one out.
I saw the film 6 hours ago.  I liked what I saw.  I'm just not sure
*what* I saw any more.</P>
<P>     FIGHT CLUB is the story of Jack (Norton), a mild-mannered day-job
schlub/insomniac.  To combat his lack of sleep, Jack takes comfort in
various support groups for ailments he doesn't have, where he finds a
sudden freedom from life's pressures, surrounded by people on the verge
of recovery or the verge of death.  Soon enough, Jack becomes `addicted'
to the support groups, but things get worse when the freakish Marla
(Carter) tries to take over his space – obviously getting off on the
same thrill as Jack.</P>
<P>     Soon, Jack is back where he started, and on a flight home from yet
another business trip, he encounters Tyler (Pitt), a nutty character
reminiscent of The Mad Hatter, William S. Burroughs, and The Unabomber
all rolled up into one.  When Jack arrives at home, he finds his condo
mysteriously blown up, and he ends up moving in with Tyler in a craphole
of a house.  Tyler takes Jack down a road of self-discovery, mainly
through violence, and together they found Fight Club, an underground
bareknuckled boxing society – a big step beyond `self-help.'</P>
<P>     As the movie progresses, so does the darkness of Fight Club.  Its
membership skyrockets, and its extracurricular activities turn
subversive.  The explosive ending introduces a twist a la THE SIXTH
SENSE, which finally helps the movie make some sense.</P>
<P>     Along the way, FIGHT CLUB is quite a ride.  Director Fincher
(SEVEN) knows atmosphere, and atmosphere is what you get, starting right
with the opening credits, which feature a ride through the human brain.
Norton narrates the entire film, which puts you right inside his head.
The acting is superb, and Meat Loaf is quite hilarious as an enormous
man with no testicles and two giant breasts (I'd explain, but...).</P>
<P>     FIGHT CLUB is not going to appeal to everyone the way SIXTH SENSE
did.  It's bloody and violent (hence the name), but it's as unique a
film as you're likely to see this year.  I don't wanna see any hate mail
about this review... or else we're gonna have to take this outside.</P>
