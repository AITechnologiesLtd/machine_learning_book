<P>Writer-actor Steve Martin has a genuine love for the art of cinema and 
filmmaking in general. How did I come to this conclusion? Easy. Because no 
one could have possibly written the new comedy, "Bowfinger," without having 
an overwhelming fondness for movies, as the main character is the 49-year-old 
struggling novice director, Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin), a man whose 
inspiration was no doubt Edward D. Wood, Jr., the '50s and '60s filmmaker who 
had a passion for his craft, but made what some widely consider the worst 
films ever made, most notably "Plan 9 From Outer Space" and "Glen or Glenda." 
With his stock acting troupe that includes a Mexican screenwriter (Adam 
Alexi-Malle) and Carol (Christine Baranski), his loyal sole actress, Bobby 
Bowfinger has been attempting to get a film greenlit in Hollywood for years 
now, even having set up his own production company (without any productions 
to its name, thus far), Bowfinger International Pictures. One day, a light is 
sparked in Bobby when his writer hands him a sci-fi script entitled, "Chubby 
Rain," about aliens that fall to Earth within raindrops. Cleverly running 
into distinguished film producer Jerry Renfro (Robert Downey Jr.), Renfro 
lets Bobby know after reading the first and last pages that he will have a 
"go" picture if he can get popular movie star Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) to 
agree to topline the project. After a disasterous encounter with him at his 
mansion, Bobby, in ultra desperation, devises a plan to still make "Chubby 
Rain" with Kit: he will get his assistant (Jamie Kennedy) to stake out Kit's 
every move, hide a video camera out of sight, and instruct the rest of his 
actors, playing aliens, to walk up to him, say their lines, and let Kit react 
to the scene as if it is real--because for Kit, of course, it is real, and he 
soon becomes convinced that people are actually out to get him. To Bobby's 
surprise, this unconventional, decidedly illegal, method of filmmaking starts 
off very well, but when Kit finally goes into hiding, it is up to the team to 
find someone to be Kit's stand-in, which he finds in Jiff, a nerdy, 
braces-wearing McDonald's employee.</P>
<P>As the premise for a big-studio comedy, "Bowfinger" is dynamite in the story 
department. Reminiscent in some ways to Tim Burton's 1994 film, "Ed Wood," 
"Bowfinger" is fascinating throughout due to its meticulous, intriguing look 
at moviemaking. The way that Bobby Bowfinger gets his actors to interact with 
an unknowing Kit Ramsey is ingenious, and cause for many big laughs, while 
director Frank Oz (1991's "What About Bob?" and 1997's "In & Out") is just 
the right man for the job, a talent who is almost a sure-thing when it comes 
to making a feature comedy.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, aside from its sheer inventiveness, which helps to make the 
picture worth seeing for this reason alone, "Bowfinger" is fairly shallow 
when handling its many characters. As the at-first-innocent Daisy who comes 
to L.A. to be a star and decides to sleep with everyone she comes into 
contact with to get a boost in the biz, Heather Graham is wonderfully giddy 
and high-spirited, and her performance is an improvement on a comedic level 
from her ho-hum appearance in this summer's earlier, "Austin Powers: The Spy 
Who Shagged Me." What is so disappointing about Daisy, however, is that her 
character would have been more funny and likable had she not metamorphosized 
virtually overnight from a ditzy, innocent country girl (she makes her first 
appearance by getting off a bus, walking into an audition for Bowfinger, and 
earnestly asking, "Is this where you come to be a star?") into a promiscuous 
actress who goes through men (and women) like she goes through packets of 
ketchup. In perhaps the film's best performance and a more substantially 
large role than she usually plays, Christine Baranski is top-notch and 
hilariously wacky as an astoundingly over-the-top actress who, in "Chubby 
Rain," plays the role of a knife-wielding alien who repeatedly screams, 
"Bastard!" every time she sees Kit. As for Jamie Kennedy (1996's "Scream" and 
1997's "Scream 2"), as Bowfinger's camera operator and assistant, he is 
almost just as wasted as he has been in every film following his stint in 
that popular horror series.</P>
<P>All of the talk I had heard going into "Bowfinger" was about Eddie Murphy's 
standout duel roles as Kit Ramsey and Jiff, but that is where the film's most 
major flaw lies. Although Murphy appears throughout the film and is engaging 
with what he is given, he plays the two roles only half of the time, 
therefore making both Kit and Jiff one-dimensonal supporting characters. Once 
Jiff enters into the film midway through, Kit mostly disappears, and nothing 
is really done with Murphy's second personality, aside from using him in one 
of the comedic centerpieces, in which he has to run across a roaring, busy 
freeway. Regardless of the hype, it is Steve Martin who is the star of the 
picture, and his Bobby Bowfinger feels tailor-made for the actor (no shock 
there, since Martin wrote the screenplay). The problem is, for a comedy, 
Martin isn't particularly funny either, but mostly "the straight man" for 
which everyone else plays off of. </P>
<P>And so lies the outcome of "Bowfinger," which is that the film is far more 
successful in its examination of pedestrian moviemaking, and gains most of 
its laughs from this aspect, rather than in the mostly forgettable 
characters. For example, one of the highlights of the picture is a sequence 
set in a parking deck in which Kit keeps hearing a second pair of footsteps 
every time he walks. I won't give away the comic payoff, but it is a laugh 
riot the way that the scene is milked for all its worth, as well as in its 
perfect comic timing. Too many problems detract from "Bowfinger" to make it 
be considered a "great" comedy, but it is a good one, not to mention the most 
entertaining movie about movies that I've seen in a few years (at the very 
least, better than the disasterous 1998 bomb, "Burn Hollywood Burn: An Alan 
Smithee Film"). For its amount of laughs, however, it places below the likes 
of this summer's "American Pie," "Drop Dead Gorgeous," and "Dick," well above 
that of "Austin Powers" and "Mystery Men," and about equal to "Big Daddy." 
Not at all a bad place to stand in a comedy-crowded summer season.</P>
