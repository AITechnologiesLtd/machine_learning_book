<P>Even though this review contains ** NO SPOILERS **, I would highly suggest
that any of you interested in seeing this film, try not to read much about
it, because the less you know, the more likely you are to enjoy the entire
process. Trust me.</P>
<P>PLOT:
I am seriously not going to say much about this film's plot other than to
point out that it's about a guy who has a rare disorder which deletes his
short-term memory and that he's essentially trying to find the person who
raped and murdered his wife. Now strap on the mental cap, do not turn away
from the screen for more than a second, and enjoy the groovy ride.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Every now and again, a film comes out and reminds us how cool movie watching
can be. How a film can just take a hold of your mind, massage it a little
here, toss you a little clue there, show you something here, and allow you
the opportunity to take part in a real-life mystery of the mind. Wow, this
movie blew me away! I mean, I'm still thinking about it as I type this, and
I dig that kind of thing! The puzzle of the story, the development of the
characters, the unsure nature of the entire premise soaked in lotsa style,
innovative filmmaking techniques and superb acting (Guy Pearce deserves a
lot of recognition for this one). But before you read the next sentence, you
must also appreciate the fact that this film is not for everyone. It is a
film designed for people who love to think at the movies. Now don't me
wrong, I love popcorn cheese-fests as much as the next guy (see my ode to
such in my review of ARMAGEDDON, natch!), but I also love all types of other
films too, and boy, is this ever another type of film! The basic premise of
this movie is an interesting one to begin with. Here's a guy who cannot
access his short term memory and he's looking for a murderer. Now you'd
think that a "regular" murder investigation would be difficult enough as it
is, but without any short-term memory? How does he do it? How does he know
how things are evolving, who to trust, who's lying, who's talking behind his
back and if he's getting any closer...if he can't remember something he did
fifteen minutes ago!?!</P>
<P>Anyway, needless to say, this quandary is one that is delved into completely
in this movie, and within that, the entire structure of the film is
remarkable. The deconstruction of the story, the actual participation of the
audience as we, essentially, learn things along with the protagonist, the
suspense, the humor (yes, there are actually a few very funny moments in
this movie as well) and the denouement, which boggles the mind as it
unfolds, and continues to boggle as you walk out of the theatre. This is the
kind of movie that'll have you talking about it all the way down the stairs,
into your specific mode of transportation, out of your transport, into your
house and onto the phone for even more bla-blas. The Arrow and I dissected
this puppy for at least an hour after the movie, and continued to learn new
things as we conversed. A triumph. A genuinely original film which makes you
want to see it over and over and over again.</P>
<P>I don't think I've ever seen a film which gives the viewer a greater
understanding of what it's like to be in the skin of the film's lead
character. This movie really does make you feel like you are learning things
along with the main man, and as his past begins to clear up, so do the
events leading up to the film's eventual ending. Now does all that sound
like an interesting idea to you? Are you grooving on that concept or does
the whole thing just leave you shrugging your shoulders? Well, if you're not
in the mood to think or ingest loads of information, as you struggle to hold
onto the information which was passed along to you right before that, I
suggest you not take part in the viewing of this film, cause you will most
likely not appreciate it. But for those people, those few proud men and
women, those who love to watch movies and talk movies and shit movies, I
tell you, there probably isn't going to be many better films than this one
this year, so buy that ticket, shut out all those external circumstances and
people (in other words, don't see it in a busy theater or with someone who
wants to talk crap while you watch) and get ready to allow your mind to be
thoroughly f*cked through the ringer...but in a good way! :) Hitchcock and
Kubrick would be proud. Thank God...this movie has single-handedly restored
my hope in the rest of the films coming out this year. Woo-hoo...bring it
on!</P>
