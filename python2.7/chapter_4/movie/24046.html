<P>It's amazing where the day will take you.  Facing two movie 
doubleheaders this weekend, I was all set to be blown away by WHERE THE 
MONEY IS and bored spitless by KEEPING THE FAITH.  Would "oh ye of 
little faith" be too lame to say here?</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Brian (Edward Norton), Jake (Ben Stiller), and Anna (Jenna Elfman) were 
inseparable friends as kids; Anna moved to California with her family, 
leaving Brian and Jake behind in New York.  Brian grew up to be a 
priest, Jake became a rabbi, and both were determined to "kick the dust 
off faith", bringing it into the 21st century, by staying in touch with 
their community.  This is made somewhat difficult by the resistance of 
the elder rabbis (Eli Wallach, Ron Rifkin) who want to maintain 
long-standing tradition.  Jake's life is further complicated by the 
matchmaking service is mother (Anne Bancroft) wants to perform for 
him--against his will.</P>
<P>Now all grown up and kinda sparkly, Anna reenters their lives when her 
business ("she's analyzing synergies, or synergizing analogies...") 
brings her back to New York.  And suddenly, the "cloth" that both men 
wear, fits a little too snugly for comfort.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
I have to be careful not to gush here, lest I go into every single, 
specific detail of what I liked about this movie.  And there are many 
things, not the least of which is the fact that though there's nothing 
particularly "new" in this movie--boy and boy meet girl; boy and boy 
fall for girl; girl move away; girl come back; boy and boy vie for her 
attention--the *way* it was told, and the sincerity with which it came 
across, was very refreshing.  And as jaded as I've been lately due to 
this pretty dreadful movie season, that's saying a lot.</P>
<P>When wearing his director's hat, Edward Norton brings a fresh view to 
the screen that's been missing for quite some time now.  Maybe in 
knowing that he was directing, I paid more attention than I normally 
would; but for a first-time feature film director (I think), he did an 
amazing job of getting good camera shots, without going overboard as far 
too many pretentious artistes do these days.  I especially liked his 
shots in and around the bar (uh, no pun intended); for some reason, they 
stood out as being different from anything that I've seen in a 
mainstream film recently.  Perhaps it's because even though the barroom 
banter was funny, it wasn't forced humor--and even further, because it 
felt intimate in a way, instead of in-your-face.  We've all heard the 
cliches about bartender-as-confessor; Norton somehow avoided the cliche 
and achieved a genuine sense of that reality, without making the humor 
maudlin.  Scenes like this exist throughout the movie; you get the 
feeling that there's a real and important story being told, rather than 
a mass of images moving swiftly to a conclusion.</P>
<P>But as enjoyable as Director Norton's work was to me, Actor Norton's 
performance as Father Brian Finn was even more fun to watch.  Whether 
with Jenna Elfman (with whom he had this incredible chemistry; Anna and 
Brian's relationship was much more convincing than was hers with Jake), 
Ben Stiller, or especially the great rapport he had with the "minor" 
supporting characters like the Bartender (Brian George) and Karioke Tong 
(Ken Leung), Norton's skill as an actor made me easily forget that this 
was the same man who played a skinhead in AMERICAN HISTORY X and an 
airhead in FIGHT CLUB.  It is a compliment to his abilities that the 
"priest on fire" scene that I've seen in the "Faith" trailer multiple 
times, was no less funny when I saw it in context of the movie; in fact, 
I think I laughed even harder than I did when I first saw it.  Norton is 
truly an underrated actor; and since the Academy is notoriously 
short-sighted when it comes to recognizing comedies at the podium, 
chances are that he'll remain unrewarded for his work here, too.</P>
<P>As I alluded to above, Elfman's best work was with Norton; leaving no 
traces of her flower child Dharma character (from the DHARMA AND GREG TV 
series), she impressed me most when she was dealing with Brian's "crisis 
of faith".  But to my pleasant surprise, I enjoyed Stiller's performance 
almost as much as I did Norton's, especially in their interactions 
together.  Ben Stiller is generally an acquired taste, one which I 
haven't picked up to date.  But in "Faith", he seemed less concerned 
about being "raw and edgy" than he has been in past performances (like 
his roles in MYSTERY MEN and BLACK AND WHITE, for instance).  Here, 
Stiller seems to sense the importance of his rabbi character's sincerity 
about his "flock", coming across, and it shows in his performance.  This 
is not to say that the good rabbi was all serious; as with Norton's 
trailer scenes, the previews with Stiller and "Workout Chick" (Lisa 
Eldestein) held up, if less so.   What really made me sit up and take 
notice, though, is that Stiller didn't allow his comedy bits to 
overshadow the overall character and Jake's struggles with being a 
needful human on the one hand, and feeling obligated to serve his 
congregation in the way he thought they needed him most, on the other.  
More than at any other time I've watched Stiller, I Felt his 
character--and liked him.</P>
<P>Just as I said to myself, "there's nothing about this movie I don't 
like!" near the end of the flick, it started to slow down to almost a 
crawl.  I was appreciative of that break, though; if I had been 
completely in love with this movie, I think I would've questioned my own 
sanity.  The flaws in it made me appreciate it all the more, from the 
efforts of the main cast, to the importance of the "minor" characters 
(that Bartender had me in absolute stitches, as did Tong), to the 
curiousness I've developed about Judaism, since I didn't understand a 
great deal what was going on with that aspect of the story.  If I may 
allow myself a single cliche--even at its worst, it was better than most.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor"  [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
Actually, let's dish on "The Church Factor" today.  </P>
<P>As the daughter of a fiery Baptist mother, I connected to this flick on 
so many levels, especially when the rabbi and the priest attempted to 
get their respective members to participate more in the services.  The 
most obvious connection came when Jake brought the Black choir in to the 
synagogue, to liven up the services.  I was immediately taken back to 
the time when I was the drummer for a campus choir, and we stepped out 
of our ordinary performance rotation of Black Baptist and Pentacostal 
churches, by going to a White Presbyterian church, at their request.  
The experience was definitely memorable.  Though the scene was played 
for laughs on-screen, I have a feeling Jake's bunch had as good a time 
as we all did.  The church scenes also reminded me of the time when my 
holy-ghost-shoutin'/already-been-baptized mother went to a service at 
the Catholic church she would sometimes allow me to go to; remind me to 
tell you about it one day, but needless to say, St. Cecilia's was never 
quite the same after mama was in tha' house...</P>
<P>But beyond those connections, I related easily to Jake and Brian's 
message itself, that of trying to reach their members on a personal 
level: not through the recanting of years and years of traditional 
rites, but by appealing to their sense of community.  I'm probably 
telling on myself when I say that I've missed that aspect of my life 
most in my transition from being a member of a tight-knit community when 
I was growing up, to the supposedly sophisticated semi-suburban dweller 
that I am today.  Characters in a movie though they may be, I could dig 
being a member of either of the God Squad's congregations.</P>
<PRE>Thus endeth the sermon.</PRE>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line: 
Hallelujah!  Finally, an unadulterated, unequivocally good movie in the 
year 2000.  Easily the best comedy so far this year, and a strong 
contender for best movie of this third of the year, period.</P>
<P>KEEPING THE FAITH (rating: greenlight): 
I'd say "Bless me, Father, for I have laughed", but I hate cliches.</P>
