<PRE>EVIL DEAD 2</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * * * *</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Sam Raimi
Written by: Sam Raimi, Scott Spiegel</PRE>
<P>Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend, Linda (Denise Bixler), travel out 
to a remote cabin in the woods where an archeologist (John Peaks) and his 
wife (Lou Hancock) had been staying. While Ash and Linda settle in, Ash 
discovers a tape recorder on which the professor had been translating his 
latest find, the Necronomicon. When the recorder is played, the professor's 
words wake an evil force in the woods which kills Linda and tries to kill 
Ash. Ash barricades himself in the cabin, blasting anything that comes close 
to the front door with a shotgun. Little does he know that the professor's 
daughter, Annie (Sarah Berry); his colleague, Ed (Richard Domeier); and two 
hill-billies (Dan Hicks, Kassie DePaiva) are on their way. The group first 
thinks Ash killed Annie's parents, but they soon discover the evil force is 
after them as well. Now Ash and the quickly dwindling group have to gear up 
and face the evil forces. Their weapons? A shotgun, a chain-saw, a strange 
bone knife, the Necronomicon, and Ash's wits. They're in deep trouble.</P>
<P>Five years after the release of the first "Evil Dead" movie, Sam Raimi 
brought audiences "Evil Dead II", and motion picture history was made (in my 
opinion anyway). The eternal question facing those who watch this 
magnificent movie is this: what exactly is it? Is it a horror movie? Well, 
it certainly contains horror movie elements. Afterall, blood, gore, ghouls 
and headless girlfriends with chainsaws abound. Yet it can't quite qualify 
as an out and out horror movie because there is also brilliant comedy at 
work here. While the first film had comic elements, it was still a horror 
movie. "Evil Dead II" contains a few comic sequences that have become 
certifiable classics. What really makes "Evil Dead II" strange is that it's 
not exactly a sequel. What do I mean by that? Well, the events of the first 
movie are crammed into the first five minutes of this one, but they're 
changed. In the first movie Ash went to the cabin with his girlfriend, his 
sister, and two friends. In the beginning of this movie he goes with only 
his girlfriend (who promptly dies, leading to one of the funniest scenes in 
the movie). I assume the reason for this is because so few people saw the 
first film, Raimi believed a refresher of sorts would be needed. However, 
rumors that "Evil Dead II" was actually meant to be a parody of the first 
movie have spread.</P>
<P>Five years, three movies, and multiple stage appearances after the first 
"Evil Dead", Bruce Campbell has honed his comic talents to perfection. His 
lines are delivered with sheer comic genius, and his facial expressions are 
second to none. Watch the look on his face when a wave of blood pours out of 
a wall, slams into him, then retreats back into the wall. In the first film, 
Campbell was forced to carry the entire acting load on his shoulders because 
his supporting cast was, well, dreadful. In this installment, the cast 
obviously isn't quite on par with Bruce, but they're all at least tolerable 
(that's probably why some of these people actually went on to careers, uh, 
of sorts). Sarah Berry never went on to anything else, and it's not 
surprising since of the supporting cast members she is far and away the 
worst. She constantly has a look on her face like she's watching the other 
actors closely, waiting for the exact moment when she gets to deliver her 
next line. I hate that. She does have one brief, shining moment though, when 
she goes after Bruce with an axe. Dan Hicks ("Wishmaster") gives quite an 
amusing performance as the hill-billy of the group. My favorite part with 
him is when he screams for Bobbie Joe, who has vanished into the woods. The 
look on his face and his tone of voice are wonderfully pathetic. Ted Raimi 
("Xena: Warrior Princess") shows up, completely unrecognizable as a 
possessed grandmother.</P>
<P>Remember when I said there were a few classic comic scenes in the movie? I'm 
afraid I was understating it a bit. This movie is actually packed with comic 
moments. We get a room full of furniture laughing hysterically (and Ash 
laughing right along with it); a headless girlfriend with a chain-saw 
chasing Ash around; Ash battling his own hand in a three stooges style fight 
(this scene has been mimicked dozens of times); Ash placing a pail on top of 
his severed hand and holding it down with the book, "A Farewell to Arms"; 
Ash getting knocked flying through the forest, spinning head over heels and 
crashing through tree limbs; and dozens more. There's a big laugh every five 
minutes here, plus we also get an obscene amount of gore (that's a good 
thing for me anyway) and a few really good startle effects. Will "Evil Dead 
II" scare you? Maybe if you're eight or nine years old and you still believe 
in monsters under your bed. Otherwise, it's doubtful. "Evil Dead II" isn't a 
scary movie, but it's not meant to be. It's supposed to be campy, fun, and 
highly entertaining; and it delivers on all three counts in spades.</P>
<P>Raimi's direction becomes a bit more restrained in this film, but that's not 
a bad thing, it just shows that his directorial abilities have matured. 
Don't worry, we still get the neat low camera angles, and we still have the 
monster in the woods that tears through them at break neck speed (he's 
involved in another one of the brilliant comic moments, when he chases Ash 
through the house). Yet the camera is a bit more controlled, the action not 
so frantic. Raimi's pacing has also improved, keeping the laughs and action 
consistent throughout most of the movie. In the first movie, Raimi spent 
just a little too long on the build up, and then everything hit us all at 
once. Obviously the fact that the script throws us right into the middle of 
Ash's situation contributes to the lack of down-time in this movie. Joseph 
LoDuca's ("Xena: Warrior Princess") music isn't used too often, but it's 
always appropriately campy when present. "Evil Dead II" runs a frighteningly 
quick 85 minutes. I'd recommend it to fans of the original, fans of cheesy 
"B" horror movies, and fans of Bruce Campbell. For being one of the most 
entertaining horror movies ever made, I give "Evil Dead II" a full five out 
five stars.</P>
