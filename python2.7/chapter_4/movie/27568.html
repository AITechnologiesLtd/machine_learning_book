<P>Since when did the holiday season become the time of year to reflect on
tortured artists? If you don't believe me, look at the films released in
New York and Los Angeles between Thanksgiving and Christmas. They're all
there - Marquis de Sade, Jackson Pollock, Francisco Goya and to a lesser
extent, State and Main's Joseph Turner White, Finding Forrester's Jamal
Wallace, and Shadow of the Vampire's F.W. Murnau. It's enough to drive
moviegoers to The Grinch or The Family Man.</P>
<P>Just when you thought Cuban popularity had gone the way of Men at Work
and Crocodile Dundee, Before Night Falls blends the Caribbean "It"
island of the moment with the angst-ridden story of an artist that just
begs for a December release. What's stranger is that Falls is co-written
and directed by a sculptor/painter (Julian Schnabel) whose only other
film experience was helming another film about a tortured artist
(Basquiat).</P>
<P>Luckily, Falls is much, much better than the critically over-praised
Basquiat. The leap in Schnabel's style between the two films is nothing
short of astonishing. Falls is beautifully shot and exceptionally well
put together, with Schnabel using numerous cinematic techniques, usually
to perfection. Parts of the film share the same gritty, washed-out look
of the Mexican portion of Traffic - so much so that you expect to see
Benicio del Toro make an appearance (or maybe it's the fact that he's
in, like, every movie). Schnabel also makes great use of music in lieu
of dialogue in several scenes.</P>
<P>On the negative side of things, the story of Jean Michel Basquiat was
more interesting than that of Falls' Reinaldo Arenas. The film follows
Arenas' life from his infancy in 1943 Cuba to his 1980 death in New York
City. It's tragic and all, but tragedy doesn't always equate with
entertainment (unless Kathie Lee Gifford's plane goes down over the
Rockies). Your potential enjoyment of the film will hinge on whether you
find the Arenas Chronicles to be remarkable or no different than any
other tale of a tortured artist.</P>
<P>We see a young Arenas carving poetry into a tree. We see an older Arenas
get a job at Cuba's National Library and join the rebels that eventually
put Castro into power. But, mostly, we see Arenas write and then die a
slow, painful death. Yeah, it's kind of interesting to see how he had to
share a bed as a child, and how he was persecuted because of his unique
ability as a writer, but we've seen this kind of thing before. Other
than Schnabel's direction, three superstar cameos (one from Sean Penn
and two from Johnny Depp) and a pretty electrifying (but still a bit
over-hyped) performance from Javier Bardem (Almodovar's Live Flesh),
there's just nothing going on here.</P>
<P>Falls was based on Arenas' memoirs, which were turned into a screenplay
by Schnabel and debut scribes Cunningham O'Keefe and Lázaro Gómez
Carriles. The cinematography is pleasant, and Carter Burwell's (O
Brother, Where Art Thou?) effective score is bolstered by help from
Laurie Anderson and Lou Reed.</P>
<P>2:05 – R for strong sexual content, some language and brief violence</P>
