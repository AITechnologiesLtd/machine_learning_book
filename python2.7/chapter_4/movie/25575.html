<P>     That uniquely fin-de-siecle phenomenon known as the "rave" gets its
sociological moment in the sun in GROOVE, a film that will be more
effective as cultural curiosity a few years hence than it is as a story
today. Greg Harrison's episodic tale opens with a group of self-styled San
Francisco party masters, led by Ernie (Steve Van Wormer), selecting an
abandoned warehouse for the following night's party. Then the word goes
out to email and pagers, bringing together a collection of characters for
dancing into the wee hours. Colin (Denny Kirkwood) brings along his more
straight-laced brother David (Hamish Linklater), who expects he'll want to
leave early. Colin also brings along his girlfriend Harmony (Mackenzie
Firgens), to whom he intends to propose, while David hooks up with
recently transplanted New Yorker Leyla (Lola Glaudini). As the DJs spin
on, so do their stories and several others spin along for 86 minutes.</P>
<P>     That time is moderately well-spent as an introduction to the rave
sub-culture. Harrison drops in a few bits of memorable lingo ("buying a
vowel" for purchasing either acid or Ecstasy; "the nod" for the
party-goer's acknowledgement of the party-thrower's success; "baked,
not fried" for one fellow's expressed preference for marijuana over
hallucinogens) to set the scene without stranding newcomers in the 
minutia. There's a funny scene in which a relatively inexperienced DJ
(Bing Ching) shakes his head at the expertise of a pro, and another in
which the uptight David assumes Leyla is offering him drugs when she's
offering him earplugs. From the dance floor to the fruit-and-water-stocked
"chill room," GROOVE re-creates its unique world as effectively as you
could hope for.</P>
<P>     Harrison then proceeds to populate that world with one unmemorable,
uninvolving character after another. Most of the narrative is spent on
David and Leyla, whose budding relationship is supposed to be the core of
the film but feels like just another drug-fueled party scam. Worse still
is the contrived drama in the relationship between Colin and Harmony,
which takes a "hip," independent film sort of turn for the worse. There
are other sub-plots, including the inability of a gay couple to find the
party location, but they offer little to latch on to. The acting is
servicable at best, the characterizations not even that. GROOVE is
composed entirely of people doing the sort of thing one sees people do at
raves, played with all the energy and commitment of people playing types
-- you're the uncomfortable geek, you're the dealer, you're the party
princess, and so on.</P>
<P>     The issue isn't that GROOVE meanders along in its night-in-the-life
way without trying to be particularly profound. DAZED AND CONFUSED and
AMERICAN GRAFFITI were charming studies of its era's revellers, and no one
much cared if an epiphany was to be found. Both of those films, however,
had the benefit of a nostalgic distance, allowing both film-maker and
audience to recognize the silliness inherent in youthful celebration. Greg
Harrison is too serious about this milieu; he seems to be making the
suggestion that kids really have found party nirvana this time, not like
those goofy kids of the '60s, '70s and '80s. It's no wonder the characters
are irrelevant; Harrison just needed bodies to jump up and down to the
beat. His take on the rave scene, detailed though it may be, isn't DAZED
AND CONFUSED for the '90s. It's THANK GOD IT'S FRIDAY for the '90s.</P>
