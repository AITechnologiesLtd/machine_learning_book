R, 1995
Director: David Fincher
Screenplay: Andrew Kevin Walker
Starring Cast: Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow</PRE>
<P>I'm going to begin this review by explaining that when I saw SE7EN on
video, I watched about the first 30 minutes, was interrupted for about
another 30 minutes, then resumed and watched the remaining hour and a half.
Why, you may wonder, am I telling you this? Well, because it's put me in a
bit of a pickle: I found much to admire about the film, and looking back on
it, I can see how all the different scenes fit together into a coherent
whole. My gut reaction, however, was that it still felt  kind of
disjointed. One side of me says I should go with my gut reaction. The other
side says, "Well of course it felt disjointed, you quit watching the thing
for half an hour in the middle!" As you've probably guessed from the
rating, I've decided to give SE7EN the benefit of the doubt, so I'll spend
most of the review explaining why I think it's actually a better film than
it seemed to be while I was watching it.</P>
<P>SE7EN tells the story of David Mills (Brad Pitt), a young homicide
detective working his first case in a new precinct under the tutelage of
retiring veteran William Sommerset (Morgan Freeman). The case is a
particularly horrifying set of serial killings, each murder meant to punish
someone for one of the seven deadly sins. The murderer is clearly
intelligent and deliberate, killing each victim in a way that symbolizes
his or her sin. An obese man is punished for Gluttony by death through
force-feeding, a drug dealer is punished for Sloth by being tied to a bed
and left to waste away, a model is punished for Pride by the disfigurement
of her face, and a prostitute is punished for Lust by . . . well, on second
thought, I don't really want to talk about that one. Suffice it to say that
all of these scenes are shocking and gruesome, some a little too much so:
while a certain amount of this is necessary if one is to take this subject
matter seriously, there are a couple of scenes in which director David
Fincher really shows us more than we need to see.</P>
<P>At the core of SE7EN is the relationship between the two detectives. Mills
is a cool, arrogant young cop who's comfortable investigating horrifying
murders during the day and still cheerfully going home to his wife (Gwyneth
Paltrow) and roughhousing on the floor with his hyperactive dogs. Somerset,
we sense, lets these things get to him: his manner is usually very somber
and morose, and from what we can tell, he lives a solitary and subdued home
life. Mills writes off the killer, whom we only ever know as "John Doe," as
a simple lunatic, while Somerset warns that this is a dangerous
underestimation and instead tries to understand how the killer's mind
works. And when it becomes clear what exactly the killer is up to, Somerset
goes to the library and reads Paradise Lost  and The Divine Comedy. Mills,
on the other hand, settles for the Cliff's Notes. Slowly but surely, SE7EN
emerges as a compelling argument for Somerset's approach, suggesting that
one must accept the horror for what it is before one can really defend
oneself against it. The two detectives are put through a gut-wrenching
moral test at the end, and we find that it is Somerset who keeps his cool
and Mills who discovers that he's a little closer to the "lunatic" than he
ever would have imagined.</P>
<P>The only noticeable flaw in SE7EN aside from the occasionally excessive
gore is that the screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker doesn't quite have a
handle on the killer. He's obviously a religious fanatic of sorts, and he
seems to believe his fire-and-brimstone sermons about sin and corruption.
On the other hand, the games he plays with Mills and Somerset seems to
indicate that he subscribes to the idea of "the devil is inside all of us,"
which is a strange ideology for someone who issues such venomous
condemnations of others. I also found it a little odd that someone with his
personality would even indulge in the stereotypical serial killer routine
of taunting the authorities. The character is certifiably 100% insane, of
course, so it may be a mistake to insist on too much logic in his behavior,
and I must admit that I am probably fairly picky when it comes to serial
killer stories, having watched Fox's "Millennium" and NBC's "Profiler" for
the past three years. Still, it might not have hurt to make the method to
his madness a little more consistent and focused.</P>
<P>David Fincher does an excellent job holding all this together, instilling
SE7EN with a consistent feeling of dread to accompany the disturbing story.
His moody visual style, which he would later put to use in THE GAME, is a
large part of what makes SE7EN work, and his direction is remarkably
effective and sure-handed, especially considering that his only previous
experience had been on the reportedly chaotic production of Alien 3. While
I must admit to being somewhat puzzled as to the masterpiece status this
film has been accorded on numerous Internet web sites, it's a very
successful film that tackles challenging subject matter without flinching
and yet still manages to be human.</P>
