<P>Ever get the feeling that the whole world's gone mad, or is failing to 
recognise obvious weirdness? I did, during a pitch-black screening of the 
horrible new film "Stuart Little", where I was surrounded by kids sighing 
"Aaah... so cute!" at the screen, despite the fact that it was displaying a 
warped mockery of family entertainment. "Stuart Little" is about a family 
that adopt a talking mouse. Dad (Hugh Laurie) and mom (Geena Davis) go to an 
orphanage, look at all the kids playing, say to each other "How can we 
possibly choose? They're all so wonderful!", and then decide to go for the 
mutated little creature on the floor.</P>
<P>Stuart is voiced by Michael J. Fox, one of the most loveable of actors, but 
the only emotion I felt for the character was disgust. A few weeks ago I 
complained that the poultry in "Chicken Run" displayed implausibly human 
traits; that was nothing compared to "Stuart Little", in which everyone 
pretends that this grotesque rodent IS human. "Play with your new brother!" 
Laurie and Davis tell their biological son (Jonathan Lipnicki). At one point 
there is a family get-together, and nobody points out how odd the situation 
is. They all just say "You look wonderful together!"  I held out hope for the 
voice of reason when Lipnicki shouted "Are you people all crazy? That's not 
my brother! That's a mouse!"  But soon the boy is doting on Stuart just like 
everyone else, and they're best pals. Aaah.</P>
<P>Understand that this is not a comedy, a put-on, or a fantasy. It presents its 
situation as normal and plausible. It wants to be poignant. There is 
sentimental piano music playing throughout. Nobody ever seems surprised that 
they're seeing a talking mouse, or that it's being raised by humans. And even 
though the Little family are a bunch of freaks with glazed eyes, sickening 
grins and dopey voices, with archaic clothes that look like "Father Knows 
Best" hand-me-downs, the actors play them just seriously enough to dispel any 
hope that the movie could be intended as goofiness or satire.</P>
<P>It's an unbelievably sick and appalling picture. Even if we accepted the 
premise, which we'd have to be crazy to do, it would be hard to stomach the 
content, which does not involve a story arc or dramatic conflict, but 
basically consists of everyone marvelling at Stuart whenever he does little 
mousy tricks, and telling him how great he is. Before writing my reviews I 
usually sit and scribble down my thoughts in shorthand. Almost all of my 
notes for "Stuart Little" end with exclamation marks. It is a stroke of 
remarkable good fortune that they aren't stained with dribbles of vomit. 
Apparently, the book the film is based on had the Davis character GIVING 
BIRTH to a mouse. Thank God we were at least spared that.</P>
<P>The premise could have made amusing kiddie fare if it had been a deliberately 
bizarre screwball farce, with human characters pushed into the background and 
the focus on the interaction of the animals. To see what I mean, look at the 
amusing scenes featuring Nathan Lane as the family cat. When Stuart asks him 
"Shall I rub your tummy?", he replies "How would you like to rub it from the 
inside, mouse boy?"  The conversation progresses, and Lane sighs to himself 
"I can't believe I'm arguing with lunch!"</P>
<P>I smile when I recall that moment, but my face turns sour upon remembering 
anything else about this disaster. How interesting that this week there are 
only two movies opening ("Stuart Little" and "High Fidelity"), one of them 
among the best films I've seen, and one among the worst.</P>
