<P>Here I sit at my computer about to write my review of the recent action 
comedy "Bait" starring Jamie Foxx and David Morse. This is a review I don't 
even want to write because I'd just be laying the same criticisms on it that 
I would with any other so-generic-and-predictable-it's-beyond-ridiculous 
piece of Hollywood fluff. If they're not going to give us, the audience, just 
a little credit and put something together with half a brain, why should I 
waste my time and mental energy criticising it?</P>
<P>Last summer I took this same approach with my review of "The Mummy," in that 
review I just quoted phrases my reviews of other sub-par movies. I think I 
shall do the same thing here but with a few less quotes (not all are 
applicable). I hope this goes to show you what I think of "Bait" and why you 
can find out all you need to know about it without having to take a wild 
guess. It's genuinely unfunny (I, and the other audience members only laughed 
ONCE during the entire two hours), unoriginal and unthrilling. It's not so 
bad to the point where it's fun to watch because of its badness and it's no 
so bad you absolute loathe it and are pained by watching it, it's just such a 
cliche in and of itself, that, uhh... lost my train of thought. Anyways, 
here's those quotes, enjoy!</P>
<P>"Getting an audience's attention right from the beginning plays a major role 
in how today's films work. We want to have something exciting to watch, not a 
slow build-up of a story (God forbid!), and this film plays right into the 
mainstream's hands..." - review of "Armageddon."</P>
<P>"It's clear the film doesn't want to waste time on reality and thus the 
attempt to establish plausability (the most minimal amount necessary) comes 
across as a half-assed effort. Supporting characters and shady sup-plots are 
introduced, but as is the case with films made up of a large cast of 
characters, only a handful have any real significance... There's a fine line 
separating homage from plagiarism...," - review of "Godzilla" (1998)</P>
<P>"Unfortunately, as is the case with most modern thrillers, once the film 
showed potential for authenticity and intelligence, the cliches and action 
sequences take over," - review of "The Jackal."</P>
