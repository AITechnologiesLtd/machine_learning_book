<P>As of late, certain summer movie releases have been utilizing a common
trend. In The Sixth Sense, an unforeseen final twist in the story-line
has surprised many moviegoers who were not expecting anything of the
sort. And earlier in the season, the terrorist thriller Arlington Road
concluded with a devious turn of events that had me staggering out of
the theater. The Astronaut's Wife is the latest summer entry to attempt
this strategic maneuver, and the first to fall flat in the process.</P>
<P>If writer/director Rand Ravich does one thing effectively, it's building
the audience's anticipation for his uneventful script to switch into
high gear. As this predictable and untimely surprise finale hits, a
painful realization sets in. Ravich has been moderately successful with
intriguing us until this point, only to reveal he has nowhere to go.
This leaves numerous questions unanswered, many opportunities unfairly
squandered, and ultimately an unsatisfied audience exiting the theater
while swearing and cursing in disgust. The set-up is interesting enough,
but sadly there is no recognizable payoff in this disappointing effort.</P>
<P>The story follows NASA employee Spencer Armacost (Johnny Depp), who is
sent into orbit with fellow astronaut Alex Streck (Nick Cassavetes) on a
routine space shuttle mission. The assignment seems to be going
according to plan until a freak explosion occurs, severing all
communications to Earth for roughly a two minute period. Worried wives
Jillian Armacost (Charlize Theron) and Natalie Streck (Donna Murphy) are
relieved when their husbands arrive back safely. But both are surprised
to find bizarre personality changes occurring in the men. When Jillian
becomes pregnant, she begins to question if Spencer is the same person
he was before the mission. What happened in those two minutes? Use your
imagination....</P>
<P>The beautiful Charlize Theron is, consequently, displaying a short
blonde look that suspiciously resembles Mia Farrow's in the 1968
thriller Rosemary's Baby. This is only one of the movies that The
Astronaut's Wife derives its premise from. There is also a pinch of
Species II (of all things) and a dash of The Fly thrown in to boot. The
best elements of these films combined could produce an excellent,
hair-raising suspense film. Unfortunately, The Astronaut's Wife is
hardly a top-notch effort. Theron's character spends basically the
entire duration of the film learning facts we already know, thanks to a
very informative trailer that spoils most of the thrills. Despite
enormous potential in the initial story, there is hardly a twist
involved - excepting (of course) the final `surprise'. One would hope
that Ravich had something stylish or striking up his sleeve, but it is
ultimately disappointing when we realize he has settled on the obvious.
His script and direction leave much to be desired.</P>
<P>In the title role, Theron does an admirable job. Her emotional and
mental breakdowns in certain scenes are highly convincing, even as she
goes through the familiar steps. Johnny Depp, speaking with an unusual
drawl that made me cringe, has considerably less success. His delivery
is highly flawed, and Depp seems surprisingly miscast in the role. The
excellent Joe Morton (Speed, Blues Brothers 2000) provides some thankful
assistance as Sherman Reese, a NASA official who fears that something
went terribly wrong in space. And Clea DuVall (The Faculty) has some
promising moments as Jillian's younger sister.</P>
<P>The Astronaut's Wife was not screened for critics before release, and
I'm not exactly sure why. There's certainly early promise, some solid
acting, and a steady pace that maintained my complete attention. While
Ravich doesn't do anything terribly wrong to upset the balance, he never
succeeds in doing much right either. And who can blame the average
viewer for feeling cheated, after staying with this promising formula
for nearly two hours, only to have it botched by a pathetic ending like
this. We deserve more than The Astronaut's Wife delivers.</P>
