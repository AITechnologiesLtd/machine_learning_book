<P>"Three Seasons," a bittersweet film set in contemporary Saigon,
crosscuts between three pairs of people struggling for love and
fulfillment in a world entirely hostile to those goals. The Saigon of
"Three Seasons" is a money jungle where people eke out livings against
a backdrop of garish new hotels. That Vietnam was once the hope for
progressive people around the world, as well as its own people, gives
the film added poignancy and a sense of lost possibilities.</P>
<P>The film opens with Kien An (Nguyen Ngoc Hiep) being admitted to a
suburban walled compound where she will work picking white lotuses to
sell on the streets of Saigon. This young woman joins her co-workers
in the daily harvest on a small pond that is faced by a large
foreboding house occupied by the Teacher Dao (Tran Manh Cuong), who
has not been seen in public for many years. Someone tells her that it
is his ghost who lives there. Their work is of a primeval nature,
perhaps unchanged for a thousand years or more. They row across the
pond in tiny rowboats, pick the beautiful white flowers, while singing
work songs. One day, to the resentment of the more senior
lotus-pickers, Kien An adds new verses which have more depth and
subtlety than the simple verses usually sung.</P>
<P>Teacher Dao hears her new verses and bids his servant bring the young
woman to see him. She discovers that the man, of an indeterminate age,
is confined to a wheelchair. He is in the advanced stages of leprosy
and his fingers have been eaten away by the disease. He tells her that
she will be his fingers and begins to compose new poems that she
spends each day transcribing. Their partnership gives meaning to their
lives. What can not change is her daily chores on the pond and on the
streets of Saigon. This simple laborer's life is being wasted, as her
master's is wasting away due to disease.</P>
<P>The next pair includes James Hager (Harvey Keitel), a Vietnam veteran
who sits outside his hotel each day staring into the windows of the
"Apocalypse Now" disco, where he believes he will find the daughter he
left behind in the war. That is where he met her mother, who has
recently died. One night he runs into a street kid Woody (Nguen Huu
Duoc), who survives by selling trinkets out of a folding case. As
Hager spills out his story to the young boy over a beer in the disco
late one night, the lights go out suddenly. When they come on again,
the case is missing. For Woody, this is as much of a blow as the loss
of the bicycle in the neo-realist classic "Bicycle Thief," which was
also set in a grim postwar urban setting. Woody assumes that Hager has
stolen the case and spends his days wandering around the city
searching for the American and his case. Meanwhile, Hager continues
his search for his daughter.</P>
<P>The casting of Keitel is no accident. He lent his considerable clout
in the industry as Executive Producer in order to make the film
happen. The only thing he got in exchange was the privilege to act in
one of his most powerful roles to date. Keitel has long been
associated with independent films like "Three Seasons" and deserves
enormous credit for making this latest one happen. Nguen Huu Duoc,
like the young star of "Central Station," was also a non-professional
who the director discovered on the streets of the city doing exactly
what he does in the film: selling trinkets. Both films are about the
desperate situation of children and it is a sign of the integrity of
the films' creators that they made this casting decision.</P>
<P>The final pair, who really define the dramatic and emotional core of
the film, are Hai (Don Duong), a pedicab driver and Lan (Zoë Bui), the
woman he falls in love with--a prostitute. When he first meets her,
she is running from a bar after having an altercation with a client.
Lan offers to drive her home and falls in love with her instantly.
>From that moment on, he follows her everywhere, just to be near her
and to be able to drive her home. While she at first appreciates his
solicitousness, after a while she becomes annoyed. What does he want
from her? She is so used to having men treat her like a piece of meat
that she can not relate to someone who loves her for herself. She
tries to wise him up. She points at one of the new hotels and lectures
him. You see that place? The people who stay there look nothing like
us. They have money and we have none. Someday when I have money I will
join them and leave all this behind.</P>
<P>Hai does not know how to respond to her. There really is no answer,
because the new Vietnam is based on money and nothing else. The only
hope is to find a job with a multinational corporation or sell your
flesh. Lan is the realist. This does not prevent Hai from continuing
to pursue her. When he finally wins $200 in a pedicab race, he uses
$50 to buy Lan's services. When they go up to a hotel room, he only
asks her to remove her makeup, change into a nightgown that he's
bought her, and go to sleep. When she awakes, she discovers that he
has gone without touching her.</P>
<P>Perhaps the only person capable of making such a film is Tony Bui, the
writer and director who fled the country with his family in 1970 when
he was two years old. He visited Vietnam in 1994 and developed what he
described as a passion for the country. He explains that, "A driving
force for me was to make a film in Vietnamese with Vietnamese actors
and to tell a modern story. Growing up I only saw the Vietnamese in
war films, as faceless people running through the jungles with guns.
That's not what I saw when I went there. I wanted to bring out their
humanity in a way that hasn't been shown, the universality of the
human spirit."</P>
<P>"Three Seasons" is scheduled for theatrical release later this year.
Do not miss it. It is a beautiful and moving work of art.</P>
