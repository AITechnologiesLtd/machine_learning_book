<P>Something must be said about THE PRINCE OF TIDES.  It is very possibly
the most mysterious of any Oscar nominated film ever made, because it
also one of the worst films ever made.  It is a triumph of horrible
storytelling, ugly images, questionable acting, horrendous directing and
unrelentingly terrible writing, and to appreciate it on any level is
nearly to question one's sanity.  The "glory" of the film is its failure
- very rarely is such a spectacular failure made that nothing can redeem
it.  In the more recent annals of bad films, many have been the major
releases that, unfortunately, fall back on special effects in place of
an actual story or good characters.  But THE PRINCE OF TIDES doesn't
have such comforts, and, as a result, fails on every level imaginable. 
Perhaps something can be stated about Nick Nolte's acting, but then, how
hard is it to play a stereotype of a tough southerner?  Do we celebrate
Judd Hirsch for his stereotypical Jewish role in INDEPENDENCE DAY
(1996)?  No, we celebrate him for his success as a comedian in "Taxi,"
and his acting in ORDINARY PEOPLE (1980).  This movie is as dull as it
is insulting.  A failure of epic proportions.</P>
<P>The plotline is ripped right from the worst of soap operas.  Sallie
Wingo is having an affair.  Tom Wingo's sister tries to kill herself. 
When he goes to visit her and meets her psychiatrist, Susan Lowenstein,
it's discovered that Susan's husband is also having an affair.  So Tom
and Susan have an affair together, which is clearly not only the
not-quite-professional thing for Lowenstein to do, but also totally
disregards the well-being of her son.  That son, incidentally, in
another painfully contrived subplot, is being taught to play football by
Tom, who becomes the boy's surrogate father.  We come to find out that
Tom, his sister, and his mother were all raped by escaped convicts when
he and his sister were children, another soap-ish, and downright sick,
turn of events.  Not only does this serve no real purpose in the
storyline other than to make the audience feel ill when they have to see
flashbacks of it, but it also makes little sense.  How did these three
men escape?  What location did they escape from?  How far did they go to
reach the Wingo house?  Why did they choose to break into that
particular house but none of the others along the way?  Streissand
doesn't know, or care.  She's more interested in making the worst
episode ever of "One Life To Live" than in telling a good story.  Yawn.</P>
<P>Nearly all of the roles here are stereotypes.  It's mildly amusing to
see George Carlin play a flamboyantly gay man in one of the most
anti-typecasting roles ever seen, but that's just another stupid
character/stereotype to toss on the fire.  No one is really notable,
because everyone is so one-note.</P>
<P>What is Streissand's message?  She portrays the affair of Lowenstein and
Wingo as a glorious thing.  These two married people don't love each
other in any sense, but comfort one another with sex, and Streissand
finds that beautiful.  As vomit-inducing as that sounds, it seems to be
a Hollywood trend to try to destroy the institution of marriage. 
Marriage is often portrayed as a trap, where spouses are purely evil men
(or women) who frequently cheat and have no redeeming qualities (like
Lowenstein's husband, Woodruff, is here), and act as an obstacle to
having free sex with anyone who's willing - all of whom, of course, are
better than the spouse.  Even excellent films, like TITANIC (1997), can
fall part way into this trap.  Why does this happen so much in movies? 
Is it because marriages so rarely last in Hollywoodland?  Do they want
to try to justify their multiple spouses, torrid affairs, encounters
with prostitutes, etc?  Streissand's portrayal of the glories of
extramarital affairs is a solid slap in the face to marriage and married
couples, and Streissand herself deserves a solid slap in the face in
return for this infuriating effort to strike down an institution that
the world holds dear using nothing but her ego and lack of morality as a
weapon.</P>
<P>Incidentally, since this was the first of her films that I've ever seen,
I had never actually seen the full extent of her egotistical nature -
until now.  Look at the direction in this film - in every shot in which
she appears, she zooms in on her face, her legs, her chest.  She makes
herself shine for the camera, trying to flaunt her sexiness to the best
of her ability.  Sadly, she doesn't realize that she's not sexy at all -
and, in fact, isn't terribly attractive, at least nowhere as near as
much as she thinks she is.  Especially by the Hollywood standards that
she seems to be holding so dearly.  It was considered a snub when she
wasn't nominated for best director for this movie.  I have to wonder
why... if James Cameron had made himself the star of Titanic and zoomed
in on nothing but his face in every shot, would it be as well-loved as
it is?  I would have to doubt it.</P>
<P>When it's all said and done, and the cheating couples have all finally
returned to their spouses (in a rather uncelebratory fashion, sadly),
Barbra Streissand's THE PRINCE OF TIDES is enough to make you sick. 
Today, we complain that Hollywood makes so many hollow blockbusters that
have nothing but loud explosions and big special effects to guide them. 
But I'd gladly trade this piece of gutter trash for any one of those. 
If you have the poor sense to watch it on video, take heart in the fact
that, when it's finally over, you can rip it from the VCR, declare
"Sermon over," stub out your cigar on the tape, and chuck it out the
window.  Maybe, if we're lucky, it'll sink back into the hell from
whence it came.  </P>
