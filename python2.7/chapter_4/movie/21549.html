<P>Set in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, in 1974, Outside Providence is
a sensitive but largely uninspiring coming of age tale about a teenage
slacker from the wrong side of the tracks who eventually finds wisdom.
Somewhat surprisingly, this sensitive coming of age tale comes from
Bobby and Peter Farrelly, the film making siblings better known for
their deliberately dumb and low brow sense of humour that shaped the
clever and hilarious There's Something About Mary and Dumb And Dumber.</P>
<P>Outside Providence centres around 17 year old Tim Dunphy
(Shawn Hatosy, recently seen in The Faculty, etc), affectionately
known as "Dildo" by his gruff, embittered, widowed working class</P>
<P>father (Alec Baldwin).  Tim protects his wheelchair-bound younger
brother Jackie (Tommy Bone), and hangs out with his slacker mates
(including an almost unrecognisable Jonathan Brandis, best known for
his role in SeaQuest).  His father plays cards and drinks beers with
his close mates, while they discuss such world shattering events as
Watergate and whether or not Rock Hudson is gay.</P>
<P>Following a minor traffic accident in which he rear ends a
police car while driving without a licence and engulfed in a fugue of
drug smoke, Tim is promptly packed off to Cornwall, an exclusive
preparatory academy.  A misfit and a rebel, he struggles against the
strict rules and regulations of the college, and clashes with his
humourless dormitory head.  Much of the film also focuses on his
developing relationship with the beautiful Jane (Amy Smart, from
Varsity Blues, etc), who attends the nearby girl's school.</P>
<P>  Outside Providence is based on Peter Farrelly's own
semi-autobiographical novel, although the material lacks anything of
real substance or interest to say.  The brothers put their
predilection for crass toilet humour and hilarious sight gags on hold,
for the duration.  They have handed over directorial chores to
co-writer Michael Corrente (American Buffalo, etc), who brings a touch
of restraint and sensitivity to the material.  Lacking eye catching
gags about zippers, hair gel, flatulence and dead dogs, Outside
Providence is a rather straightforward and bland tale that ultimately
lacks broad appeal.  It's difficult to feel any sense of empathy
towards the characters and their exploits.</P>
<P>The performances from the young, largely unknown cast are
solid.  Hatosy makes the most of his role as the likeable rogue, but
he occasionally struggles with the uninteresting material.  Cast
largely against type, Baldwin delivers a restrained but insightful and
sensitive performance as Tim's gruff but ultimately understanding
father, and he brings more complexity to the role than was originally
on paper.</P>
<P>Outside Providence is strongly reminiscent of Richard
Linklater's 1993 slacker generation comedy Dazed And Confused,
although it lacks the same wicked, anarchic edge.  The film also lacks
anything of real substance or interest to say.  Director Corrente
fails to imbue this disappointing blend of comedy and drama with any
real sense of nostalgia, apart from the superb soundtrack of early
'70's hits that will strike a chord with audiences old enough to
remember those halcyon days.  </P>
