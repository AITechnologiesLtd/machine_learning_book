<P>Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer (1990)
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1997 by Serdar Yegulalp</P>
<P>CAPSULE: Bleak and point-blank -- just the way it should be. Makes its case
with cold-blooded precision and intelligence.</P>
<P>"Serial killer chic" is a relatively new entry to the cultural vocabulary,
and one of the more stomach-turning ones. I've never found someone
automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively
or in great numbers, and because of that I had apprehensions about seeing
HENRY. I wasn't sure I wanted to see the story of multiple murderer Henry
Lee Lucas portrayed as some kind of nihilistic hero/antihero.</P>
<P>Thankfully, that's not the way HENRY works. The director, John McNaughton,
took a small budget and a gallery of actor friends and created a chilling
and intelligent piece of work. It doesn't provide cheap-jack explanations
for Henry's behavior: it shows him up for what he is, an unrepentant and
un-idolizable man who killed when the mood struck him.</P>
<P>At the film's opening, Henry's friend Ottis Toole has a sister, who comes by
to stay while she tries to find work in Chicago. In a viciously riveting
scene, he admits matter-of-factly to having murdered his own mother, and she
covers his hand with hers. They are damned together from that moment on.</P>
<P>Henry and Ottis eventually begin to kill for fun. The movie is especially
good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually into it: there's a
scene where the two go to buy a new TV. The pawnbroker they talk to goads
Henry with ugly words, and Henry responds by stabbing the man to death with
a soldering iron. No preface -- it smashes into us as suddenly as it does
the broker.</P>
<P>In a scene which many damned the movie for, unseen, they steal a video
camera and film the murder of a whole household, playing it back over and
over again for their own enjoyment. The movie itself, however, does not
glorify the killings, but shows instead that Henry feels no joy at his work,
only irritation.</P>
<P>HENRY succeeds thanks to excellent writing and direction as well as acting.
Michael Rooker is credible as Henry from the first frame, just standing
there, and the rest of the cast works by being unaffected and casual as
well. The producers had originally comissioned a slasher film from
McNaughton, but he decided to give them something more memorable, and
consequently the film nearly didn't see release.</P>
<P>The film does not glorify or justify -- it just shows us, with unflinching
coldness, what Henry was. I'm hard pressed to see how anyone can see this
and consider Henry any kind of "victim" or "hero". Then again, probably, so
would Henry.</P>
