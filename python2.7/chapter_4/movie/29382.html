<P>Synopsis: When adventuress Lara Croft (Jolie) finds an ancient clock 
hidden by her long-lost father (Jon Voight), it sets in motion a desperate 
search for an ancient artefact called the Clock of Ages. Competing against 
Lara in the globe-spanning quest are Manfred Powell (Glen), agent of the 
insidious Illuminati, and Lara's old flame, fellow relic hunter Alex West 
(Craig). But the race also brings to light secrets from Lara's past, and 
even she may not be prepared to uncover the truth about her father.</P>
<P>Review: The video-game-to-film transition is always a dicey proposition.
These films are often unable to appeal beyond arcade aficionados, and 
suffer a rapid slump into rental store obscurity. "Tomb Raider", though, 
is a bit different. Not only does it largely eschew the fantastical 
tendencies of most video game properties, but it evokes another movie 
franchise, its lead character being essentially a well-endowed modern-day 
Indiana Jones. Make no mistake, Jolie is very good as Lara, achieving a 
nice mix of upper-crust panache and two-fisted determination. West brings 
the excitement of the game to life, and many shots look as though they 
were lifted right off the computer monitor. But West's adherence to "Tomb 
Raider"'s roots ultimately proves to be the film's Achilles' heel as well. 
So rapid is his pacing that any sense of thoughtful filmmaking goes out 
the window. Characters flit by without development: we are expected to 
jeer Manfred Powell, but mostly because we're told to. The behaviour of 
wild card Alex West just seems to follow the whims of the plot. And 
although the writers have come up with an entertaining modern-pulp 
storyline, it is bereft of much of the charm that made Indy's adventures 
so endearing. Ultimately, the experience of viewing "Tomb Raider" is 
hardly more satisfying than watching someone else play the computer game.</P>
