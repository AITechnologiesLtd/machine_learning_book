<PRE>HALLOWEEN
**** of **** grade is A+</PRE>
<P>Halloween is as good a film as Psycho, if not a better one.  They are
both terrifying, both caused many rip offs - none of which were as good,
and both invented the mad slasher films.  Halloween builds tension so
wonderfully and keeps it so well that you keep waiting for some relief,
none is in site.  You can't even rely on corny horror cliches, other
than the one created by this film.  </P>
<P>Halloween has an escaped insane psychopath visiting his old hometown
Haddonfiels, Illinois, killing babysitters and teenagers.  This is told
not with extreme violence or splatter touches (no killing with rods) and
but tense love of suspense.  It is told as a slice of life, with hardly
any character development and none is needed.  In fact all character
development would ruin the impact and breakneck pace.</P>
<P>Many think that Comedy is the hardest genre to pull off, I think it is
horror.  Horror films have such a limit in depth of plot they can have,
originality in horror is hard to come by.  When you see a great orror
film like Halloween it is easy to over praise it.  I'm not doing that. 
Halloween is horror.  Halloween has inspire more horror films than any
other, including Psycho.  Halloween is a true terrifying experience for
those who love films and horror films.</P>
<P>** NOTE: Try not to watch this film in Pan & Scan!  This is a film that
demands letterbox or a theatre viewing (if you can).  Films like this
should be outlawed from Pan & Scan because you are missing 1/2 of the
film.  The shadows are as much a part of the film as any character.  The
only way to watch the opening mask scene and later scenes where the
killer will loom into frame is in Letterbox or Widescreen format.  DO
NOT SEE THIS IN PAN&SCAN I beg of you.  Otherwise enjoy.</P>
