<P>     This may be a first:  a movie title that gives away the ending of
the film.  Come to think of it, some of the other FRIDAY THE 13TH films
did the same thing, didn't they?  Actually, they lied.  Any bets about
this one?</P>
<P>     It's the dark of the night at Camp Crystal Lake and some stupid
girl who didn't watch any of the other FRIDAY THE 13TH movies is taking
her clothes off.  What better (and more obvious) prelude to the arrival
of Jason for his ninth resurrection.  After failing to skewer or behead
his victim on the first try, he chases her through the woods before
finally cornering her in an apparently empty clearing.  Oops.  Jason
has made a mistake.  His prey is actually a plant (not of the flowering
variety, although the performance is a bit wooden) and he's suddenly
surrounded by military-type men with all kinds of firepower.  Fourth of
July!  It doesn't take long before the killer is a mound of burnt up
organs.  It looks like it's all over.  That is, until the coroner takes
too close a look at Jason's oversized heart.  Now you and I both know
that was a dumb move.</P>
<P>     Surprise, surprise!  This film will not make my bottom ten list of
the year.  In fact, it won't come close.  Despite a legacy of horrible
previous efforts under the FRIDAY THE 13TH umbrella (of which I have
seen only three--parts 1, 2, and 8--all on cable), this film actually
has a few good elements buried amidst all the dead bodies, dumb
dialogue, and mystical nonsense.  Chief among these is that JASON GOES
TO HELL has chosen to turn the series in the direction of open
self-parody.</P>
<P>     This movie doesn't take itself seriously--at least not too
seriously.  In between the various maimings, it takes time out to poke
fun at the series' reputation, including a reference to going up to
Camp Crystal Lake to "do drugs, have premarital sex, and get
slaughtered".  It's this warped sense of humor that actually makes the
film somewhat entertaining.  In a genre where it's often difficult to
tell satires from serious attempts, the parodies in JASON GOES TO HELL
are far too obvious to be accidental.</P>
<P>     Of course, horror fans won't be disappointed.  There are the
requisite jump-out-of-your-seat-scares (complete with a burst of
over-the-top music), not to mention a high body count.  Actually, in
terms of showing the gruesome deeds, JASON GOES TO HELL is pretty
tame.  Sure, there are a lot of shots of organs and blood, but most of
the murders happen off screen.  You know how the people are
slaughtered, but you aren't subjected to watching the details.</P>
<P>     In the end, Jason gets his--again.  But is he really dead this
time?  Despite the assertion that if he's skewered by one of his
relatives, he's finally gone, I somehow doubt that.  Unless this film
runs a serious financial deficit--which seems unlikely given the
opening weekend turnout--Jason will be back.  In fact, we're even
given a substantial clue about his next cinematic adventure.</P>
<P>     After the disappointing lack of success of FRIDAY THE 13TH PART
EIGHT, Paramount Pictures, the previous distributor of these films,
gave up on the series.  New Line Cinema quickly snatched up the
rights.  The executives had a great idea for a crossover now that they
owned Jason and Freddy Krueger.  My question is, why not try to get
Michael Meyers (the killer from the HALLOWEEN series, not the guy who
should be axed for foisting SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER on us)?  Then
there could be a real gathering of the Who's Who of Maniacs.  As of
now, however, clues point to it being just Jason and Freddy.  Oh well.</P>
<P>     Make no mistake from any slight praise that I might give this
film--it is in no way a good movie.  Seeing it with the right rowdy
audience while not spending money on it (if I hadn't gotten in for
free, I wouldn't have seen this film) makes Jason's latest apparition
bearable.  For anyone who is even luke-warm about this genre, don't
take this as a recommendation to see the film.  But for blood-and-guts
lovers everywhere, the return of Jason is reason enough to trundle down
to the local multiplex for a midnight showing.  After all, you wouldn't
dare consider seeing this movie during the day!</P>
