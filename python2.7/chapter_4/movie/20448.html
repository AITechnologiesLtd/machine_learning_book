Review:                Mickey Blue Eyes</PRE>
<P>Starring:        Hugh Grant, Jeanne Tripplehorn, James Caan</P>
<PRE>Rating:                PG-13</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse, the SILVER Screen Critic</PRE>
<P>Mickey Blue Eyes is a very funny movie, and what makes it so funny is
that very few of the laugh lines have been shown in the previews and
promotional clips.  That's especially amazing because Hugh Grant has been
seen `everywhere' extolling the virtues of this latest picture,
co-produced by his girlfriend, Elizabeth Hurley.  Too many movies lately
have been ruined by the overexposure of the `funny' scenes.  They are like
connect-the-dot puzzles that tell you all.  You simply have to put them in
the proper order.</P>
<P>With Mickey Blue Eyes you are aware of the basic storyline.  Hugh Grant
plays a square type of individual.   He is an auctioneer who has fallen in
love with Gina, an elementary school teacher (Tripplehorn).  He proposes
marriage, in a hilarious scene that's stolen by the Chinese
waitress….whoops, that's owner…who involves herself in the proposal.  
It's vignettes like this that make you think about small `supporting
actress' possibilities.  </P>
<P>He discovers that his possible future father-in-law, Frank (Caan) is a
member of the mob, who `launders' money for them.  It is the merging of
the two lifestyles that gives us the wonderful basis of the film.  This is
not award winning movie making by any means but it is a very enjoyable
film, well worth the price of admission.  Although it is rated PG-13, I
really don't think that it's aimed at children.  There's nothing so bad
that they shouldn't see it, but it's not an example of what they should
emulate.  Rather than taking the kids to it, go by yourself and sit back
and laugh.  I really want to see this again, but it's probably one of
those flicks that I'll catch on free TV and watch more than once.  For
what it is, I give it an A-, an excellent light, romantic comedy.</P>
