                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>Grosse Pointe Blank (1997) ***1/2 out of ***** - Cast: John Cusack, Minnie
Driver, Alan Arkin, Dan Aykroyd, Hank Azaria, Jeremy Piven, Joan Cusack.
Written by: Tom Jankiewicz, D. V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, and John Cusack.
Directed by: George Armitage. Running Time: 106 minutes.</P>
<P>Director George Armitage's previous film, 1989's "Miami Blues", had a huge
amount of potential which it only slightly capitalized on. "Grosse Pointe
Blank" is exactly the same way.</P>
<P>Cusack plays hit-man Martin Q. Blank (honestly, why are hit-men in movies
born with hit-man names? Why not Herbert Schmedling? Anyway, I digress...)
He returns to his hometown to do a job, and it just so happens that his
10-year high school reunion is also the same weekend. He uses that as his
cover, but also uses it as an opportunity to reunite with his former
girlfriend (Driver), whom he dumped on prom night and then promptly vanished
from town.</P>
<P>"Grosse Pointe Blank" is a funny movie, with many humorous lines, scenes,
and ideas. However, the main flaw of this film is the romantic subplot,
which unfortunately overcomes the real plot and by the end of the film has
become the main story. Minnie Driver seems to be a competent actress, but
not once did I ever believe that these two characters EVER knew each other
in the past, let alone that they were ever romantically involved with each
other. There is ZERO chemistry between the two, and each scene Cusack and
Driver spend with each other brings the film to a grinding halt.</P>
<P>Alan Arkin, without a doubt one of my favorite actors, is on hand to play
Martin's psychiatrist, who doesn't really want the job upon learning what
Martin does for a living. His first scene is great, the second is brief, yet
humorous. And his remaining appearances are too quick to be anything. The
real surprise here is the return of Dan Aykroyd, who hasn't been funny in a
movie since 1989's "Ghostbusters II", and there are even people who would
argue with that, saying he hasn't been funny since a long time before. The
supporting cast is equally fine, with Piven and Azaria as standouts.</P>
<P>"Grosse Pointe Blank" has all the makings of a great film. A great story,
great cast, and great potential. But as I've stated it just falls short of
"great" status. Cusack however, proves that he can carry a movie with ease.
If this is even a minor success at the box office, combined with the money
this summer's actioner "Con-Air" (which co-stars Cusack) is expected to
bring in, he could very well find himself to be on the way to major stardom.
Time will tell. [R]</P>
