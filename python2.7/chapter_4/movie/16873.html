<P>Rating: 81 %
Starring: Robert DeNiro   Jean Reno   Natasha McElhone
Director: John Frankenheimer
After the dismal and complete disaster that was the 'Island of Dr Moreau,
director John Frankenheimer could only do better in his next big screen
effort. Well he has just done that. Ronin is an intriguing , but most of all
a thrilling rollercoaster ride full of twists and turns and on the edge of
your seat excitment. Just like the recent 'Negotiator' I was expecting
another average action movie with the usual explosions and some above
average acting. I was yet again surprised. And I do like surprises.</P>
<P>In Japan, a samurai must protect their master with their lives. The samurai
whose master was killed was a disgrace, and they were forced to wander the
land, looking for work as hired swords or assassins. A masterless warrior
were reffered to as 'ronin'.</P>
<P>We are introduced to an array of enigmatic characters basically covering all
four corners of the earth. We have an Irish contact called Deidre (Natasha
McElhone), an American who has a great deal of knowledge regarding battle
strategies and weapons (DeNiro), an English weapon specialist (Sean Bean), a
French operative (Jean Reno) and another American that is the driver (Skip
Sudduth).</P>
<P>It is set in the post Cold War era. A group of skilled people are hired to
collect a certain mysterious briefcase, which stays a mystery until the end
just like in 'Pulp Fiction'. Nobody is told what it contains or given any
specific details. All the group knows is that it is always guarded by a
group of bodyguards and that it is handcuffed to a man's arm. What they do
know is that the price is high. And they are doing this job only for the
money.</P>
<P>The movie is a wonderful action thriller. Probably the best I have seen in
years. It is a wonderful tourism ad for Paris and Nice, showcasing the
marvellous scenery. I have not seen Europe in all its splendour in a very
long time since Harrison Ford's 'Frantic'. The movies these days only shows
you cities somewhere in America like New York. I know New York so well by
now, and I have not even been there yet. It has some amazing stunts and
action sequences ever. There are two LONG car chasing scenes that is totally
awesome. It is so exciting I did not want it to end. Action , action ,
action all the way.</P>
<P>The performances from the entire cast are all superb. DeNiro(Cape Fear;
Heat) is great as usual. The scene where he guides Jean Reno and his
mysterious friend to help him remove a bullet was quite funny and
convincing. Reno (Godzilla; Professional) is an actor France should be more
proud of more than Gerard Depardieu. He has really made a name for himself
across the globe and especially in Tinsel Town. Natasha McElhone(Truman
Show) as the Irish contact is quite convincing even with her Irish
accent.She is one to watch out for in the future.</P>
<P>In conclusion all I can say is that if you like Die Hard then this is your
movie. Miss it at your own peril.</P>
