<P>     The themes of identity and individuality, as brought to the fore
by amnesia, have been a staple of thrillers since the inception of the
genre.  The success of an effort dependent upon this worn-out tactic
usually is a function of the talent of the director and the
intelligence of the screenplay.  DEAD AGAIN, brilliantly realized by
Kenneth Branagh, is an example of one such movie that works.
Conversely, SUTURE, the product of Scott McGehee and David Siegel, is
an unmitigated disaster.</P>
<P>     Clay Arlington (Dennis Haysbert) and Vincent Towers (Michael
Harris) are half-brothers who bear a striking resemblance to each
other.  Everyone in the movie comments on this, including the two
principals.  It's like looking in the mirror, they say.  There's a
problem, though, and it comes as a result of the audience's perception
of all this, for while actor Haysbert is a big, bulky African American,
Harris is tall, thin, and white.  Only Danny DeVito and Arnold
Schwarzenegger could be less alike.</P>
<P>     The producers/directors/writers are obviously having a great deal
of fun with this, but it undermines their movie.  By nature, thrillers
demand suspension of disbelief, and this gimmicky device on the part of
McGehee and Siegel destroys any hope of drawing an audience into the
black-and- white world of their film.  The audience becomes alienated
and annoyed, and desperately wants someone to say "Hey!  They're
nothing alike!"  Obviously, it never happens.  Some will probably find
this conceit to be clever and artsy, but in my opinion, it's just plain
stupid.</P>
<P>     The plot itself is relatively sparse and unoriginal.  Vincent is
guilty of murder, and decides to fake his own death, using Clay's
look-alike body as the victim of an automobile explosion.  Things go
awry, however, and Clay survives--a bloody mass of burns and broken
bones with amnesia.  As a beautiful plastic surgeon (Mel Harris) puts
his body back together, a psychologist (Sab Shimono) attempts to do the
same thing with his memories.  But Vincent is still out there,
somewhere, with a few loose ends to tie up.</P>
<P>     Excepting the first and last fifteen minutes, this is a dull
motion picture.  It's admittedly stylish--the black-and-white
photography has something to do with that--but the substance has been
stretched and padded to reach feature length.  There's a lot of fancy
psychological talk about what it means to be true to one's identity,
but it all amounts to very little.  In the end, no one's likely to
remember any of it.  I certainly don't.</P>
<P>     The acting isn't all that remarkable.  Only Michael Harris as the
creepy, detached Vincent, gives a reasonable performance, and his won't
be remembered among the great villains of the genre.  Dennis Haysbert,
Mel Harris, and Sab Shimono are on hand to pick up paychecks.  None of
the characters are of much interest to the audience, nor apparently to
the men and women playing them.</P>
<P>     In its conception, SUTURE was probably designed more as an homage
to Hitchcock than a completely original piece.  What creators McGehee
and Siegel have forgotten is that to honor a great filmmaker, it's
necessary to come up with something worth watching.  After SUTURE, they
should keep looking, because they haven't found it yet.  Maybe next
time they'll try something with sisters ... played by Nell Carter and
Holly Hunter, no doubt.</P>
