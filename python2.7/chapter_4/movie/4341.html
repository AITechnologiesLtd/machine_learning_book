<PRE>                             MIGHTY APHRODITE
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Even a good director can have an off
          film, but MIGHTY APHRODITE is an amazing misfire
          for Woody Allen in many different ways.  Most
          serious of all, the vast majority of the gags fall
          embarrassingly flat as if Allen is starting to have
          problems judging what is funny.  Rating: -1 (-4 to
          +4)</PRE>
<P>     MIGHTY APHRODITE is a strange title.  I guess the implication is
that love or at least sex is a powerful force in people's lives.  Or
perhaps that love conquers all.  But the title just does not seem to be
all that clever and in the final analysis it just does not work very
well.  That makes it perfect for one of Woody Allen's rare films that
is a nearly complete total misfire.  Admittedly, it is hard to be
totally objective about whether a film is funny or not, but from my
point of view the jokes fail one after another.  Perhaps part of the
problem is Allen's choosing the motif of the Greek drama complete with
chorus to comment on the action.  Somehow lampooning Greek choruses is
an exercise in futility.  It worked with Russian literature in LOVE AND
DEATH because he hit many different aspects of Russian literature and
make clear what he was kidding in each case.  Here it is one or two
jokes repeated over and over.  One joke is to have the chorus use
modern language and especially Yiddishisms.  The other is to have the
chorus sing modern music and it is a very similar gag.  Generally Greek
choruses just are not funny and it takes a great deal of skill to make
these jokes funny the first time they are used.  When Allen milks the
jokes by using them repeatedly, they fail him in a major way.</P>
<P>     The story told is of couple Lenny (Woody Allen) and Amanda (Helena
Bonham Carter) who are considering adopting a child.  Lenny is a
newspaper sportswriter and plays the role only a little less believably
than he played Jimmy Bond in CASINO ROYALE.  Posing him standing on a
basketball court cannot make the New York intellectual look or sound
like a sportswriter.  Suddenly the couple who have applied for a child
are given an opportunity to adopt if they decide to quick, quick,
quick.  (Is this really how the adoption process works?)  They go with
it and get what turns out to be a great child.  But Lenny is obsessed
with finding the child's real mother.  The agency has a rule against
giving out this information and, in fact, to do so would be breaking
the law.  But in an incredibly contrived scene Lenny gets the illegal
information.  Lenny tracks the woman down to find her to be hooker and
porno actress, Linda (Mira Sorvino).  Linda has a winning personality,
a losing intellect, and an irritating voice.  Getting interested in the
woman's life, Lenny tries to arrange a marriage for her with a boxer,
Kevin (Michael Rapaport), and to bury the feelings he is starting to
have for her.</P>
<P>     The jokes in this film are not just unfunny, some verge on mean-
spirited.  Among the subject for jest are about how stupid Linda and
Kevin are.  Kevin has to ask to find out which is his right fist and
which is the left.  It is not very likely and even less funny.  One of
the hallmarks of a Woody Allen script is the clever dialogue.  Here the
dialogue comes off as neither believable nor witty.  And it is given
too important a place.  Scenes that would have major dramatic impact
take place off-screen.  Prostitute Linda is freed of her entire
unwanted commitment to her pimp, but we never see her reaction when she
is told.  A later major scene between Kevin and Linda we are told about
but do not see.  Instead these scenes appear to have been eliminated to
allow room for "witty" dialogue scenes that do not advance the plot and
eventually drag.</P>
<P>     The strain of writing, directing, and starring in a film, as he
does here, is starting to show on Allen.  Each task is executed with
unexpected mediocrity here.  Allen does absolutely nothing to
distinguish his current character from the one he played in previous
films like MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY.  Helena Bonham Carter's role is
fairly colorless and is a departure for her only in that she is not
playing an indignant, pouty aristocrat.  Mira Sorvino wins the film on
points alone.  Her likable prostitute, with the Liza Doolittle
propensity for saying the unintentionally shocking, steals the show.
Ordinarily, stealing a Woody Allen film is a major distinction.  With
MIGHTY APHRODITE it seems hardly worth the effort.  Hopefully Allen
will be back on form next film.  This one gets an amazing -1 on the -4
to +4 scale.</P>
