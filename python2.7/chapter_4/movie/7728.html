<PRE>                            THREE COLORS: BLUE
                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>***
1994, R, 98 minutes [1 hour, 38 minutes]
[drama]
starring: Juliette Binoche (Julie), Benoit Regent (Olivier), Charlotte Very
(Lucille), Phillippe Volter (Realtor), produced by Marin Karmitz, written by
Krzystof Kieslowski, Krzystof Piesiewicz, directed by Krzystof Kieslowski.</P>
<P>If you ever wondered what it would be like to be invisible, "Blue" will give
you the feeling you are. It is a film where all we do is follow a woman
around, get to know her, and see what an interesting life she leads. We
hardly ever get stories told like this, and although this can become rather
strange at times, it is still original, realistic, and enjoyable.</P>
<P>We meet a woman named Julie (Binoche), who finds herself unable to cope with
the death of her husband and daughter who died in a car accident she was also
involved in. The accident itself opens up the story, but it is portrayed in
somewhat of a strange manner. At first Julie tries to commit suicide, but
can't bring herself to do it. Is she afraid of death or does she really want
to live? </P>
<P>Slowly, things start to return to normal in her life. She doesn't want
anything around her that will remind her of her family, so she sells her
house and all of her possessions and moves from the country to the city. </P>
<P>Kieslowski's film tends to have a rather strange tone, both in the way the
story is told, but also in the way it is presented, that is, not exactly in a
straightforward manner. At times this can become confusing, but nevertheless
it makes the story more intriguing and interesting.</P>
<P>Julie has some kind of an affair with her husband's friend Olivier (Regent),
but she doesn't seem to enjoy it much. It's as if she can't feel anything
anymore. This sense of emptiness can be felt throughout the film, as there is
no real plot to it, just some strangely connected events in Julie's life;
swimming, dining, talking with her neighbors, etc. </P>
<P>Some small things occur to build up her character, but it seems more like an
excuse to follow show how seemingly normal people can live unusual lives. For
example, her neighbor Lucille (Very), is a prostitute of sorts, whom she
saves her from being evicted because she won't sign a petition to have her
removed. She does this not so much to defend Lucille, but rather just to
spite everyone and stay out of controversy.</P>
<P>Julie's husband was a famous French composer whose music would supposedly
unite Europe, but when she gets a copy of his unfinished symphony she throws
it away until she learns Olivier tried to finish it. This is an example of
powerful symbolism: is it because of her own honor and/or selfishness she
would threaten something that could bring peace between nations? Or is it
love and respect for her husband, that only he could finish the piece? </P>
<P>Not much happens in "Blue" but it is still a good movie to watch just to
observe how normal people really are.</P>
