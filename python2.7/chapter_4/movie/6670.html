<PRE>                            DEATH BECOMES HER
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>Death Becomes Her (1992) * out of ***** - C:Goldie Hawn, Bruce Willis,
Meryl Streep, Isabella Rossellini, Jonathan Silverman, Sydney Pollack.</P>
<P>What the hell? The same creative team which brought us the Back To The
Future trilogy and Forrest Gump must have really been bored one day and
half-assedly thought of the idea for this garbage. After the idea was
pitched to the studio, a conversation like this must have taken place:</P>
<P>"Hey guys! The studio gave us the $50 million budget we asked for!"</P>
<PRE>"Great! Now we just need a script."</PRE>
<P>"A script? Screw the script! Let's call the special effects team! Think of
what we can get for $50 million!"</P>
<P>"What about the public? I think the people like a little script with their
special effects."</P>
<P>"Screw the public! We've got $50 million! Don't let morals cloud your mind,
we're filmmakers!"</P>
<P>And thus was born Death Becomes Her, the most pathetic special effects
comedy since Howard The Duck. There's not even an attempt at comedy in this
film except for one scene involving Sydney Pollack who plays a doctor. The
effects and the direction are excellent but are by no means enough to make a
movie interesting for an hour and a half. A total waste of talent.</P>
