<PRE>Pay It Forward </PRE>
<P>The concept of "Pay It Forward" is a simple plan developed by a 12-year-old 
boy to change the world. You'd think that would be more than enough plot for 
a major motion picture to work with wouldn't you? Imagine the possibilities 
of a movie showing how performing random acts of kindness could better the 
world - in the right hands it could be pretty powerful. Unfortunately this 
story was trusted with the wrong people who opt to make a sappy tearjerker 
instead of a poignant message. </P>
<P>This movie wins the First Annual "'American Beauty' Award for How Many 
Over-the-top plot points, characteristics and trite scenes you can Put in One 
Movie And Still Try to Market It As a Thematic Drama." 
Okay, that was kind of a mouthful, but I'll elaborate. "Pay It Forward" is 
about a young boy named Trevor McKinney living in a trailer park in the hills 
overlooking Las Vegas with his recovering alcoholic mother Arlene. Trevor is 
an over-achiever who takes everything literally and is easily discouraged 
when he fails or when things go wrong. He attends a blue-collar middle school 
somewhere in the outskirts of the city where even 7th graders are subject 
to metal detectors at the doors because some are as violent as adult gang 
members. </P>
<P>One of the main influences in Trevor's life is Mr. Eugene Simonet, a slightly 
arrogant social studies teacher whose face is disfigured by burns. Simonet 
gives his class an assignment to think of an idea that could change the 
world. He does actually expect them to do it, he just wants to see them put 
in the effort. Trevor comes up with the idea of "pay it forward" in which he 
must help three people out in pretty big ways (something they couldn't have 
done without his help) and in turn they must pay the favor forward to three 
other people instead of just doing something nice for him. </P>
<P>"Pay it forward" is a great idea and one that could easily be put into 
practice in the real world if people were willing to give it a chance and 
swallow their pride. Why do we as humans think of personally helping the less 
fortunate as a humbling and embarrassing duty? It's one thing to write a 
check to charity, it's a much different thing to volunteer your time and 
actually perform labor in the name of kindness and goodwill. But this 
Hollywood we're talking about, the only way the filmmakers think they could 
turn this idea into a good movie is by going the melodramatic route. They'd 
rather appeal to our emotions instead of taking the idea seriously and making 
us think. </P>
<PRE>It doesn't work. </PRE>
<P>Trevor starts out by bringing a bum home and allowing him to sleep in the 
garage until his mother finds out and nearly blows the bum's head off. She 
then proceeds to rip Mr. Simonet a new one when she finds out where Trevor 
got the idea. When you have a man and a woman who both have severe personal 
problems and meet in an awkward setting and immediately disagree it's clear 
they're going to fall head over heals for each other. I don't think that's 
too much a spoiler because this movie is just that predictable and sappy. </P>
<P>When we meet Arlene she's an unlikable character not only because of her 
personal demons with alcohol but she's just a bad mother. She's trying to 
protect Trevor from the cruelty of the real world but she's in total denial. 
She works as a part-time burlesque waitress and a part-time casino clerk 
always staying late and coming in early to work if she can get the time. 
We're told she's been known to just jump into bed with men and that she spent 
years with an abusive alcoholic husband. She can't understand why Trevor 
doesn't respect her much less like her (gee, I wonder why?). There's a scenes 
where the two argue and Arlene slaps Trevor and then feels guilty and shocked 
she did it. I can't believe the filmmakers try to pull this one over us. An 
alcoholic floozy mother who DOESN'T beat her kid is a lot more surprising to 
me. </P>
<P>The story is slowly-paced and the screenplay jumps all over the place between 
Trevor's relationship with his mother and her relationship with Mr. Simonet. 
At the same time there's a sub-plot involving a Los Angeles-based reporter 
who catches wind of "pay it forward" and tracks its roots all the way back to 
Trevor. There's a scene where the reporter interviews a convict who says the 
idea gave him all this clarity like a religious awakening. Uh huh. Anyone can 
just SAY they're a changed person, the film fails to fully detail this. The 
man let a girl go ahead of him in the emergency room but you still never 
believe he's about to become the next Mother Theresa of the ghetto as he 
claims he would be. </P>
<P>After the halfway point of the film the "pay it forward" concept is 
essentially gone and instead the film is a laboring melodrama of conflicts 
between the characters, most of which are blown out of proportion. Eugene and 
Arlene start dating but don't have much chemistry. I guess we're supposed to 
simply assume that they're lonely and are together because they sympathize 
with each other, not so because they genuinely like each other. A few more 
conflicts arise such as when Trevor tries to run away from home and when his 
father returns after a long asbsence, claims he's sober, and Eugene flips 
out. </P>
<P>There have been quite a few dramas about alcoholism in families and how it's 
cyclical and genetic. "Pay It Forward" uses that concept for its drama but 
takes it rather lightly. There's a few scenes of screaming and yelling 
between the characters about how screwed up their lives are but after they're 
done nothing has really changed. </P>
<P>This film was directed by Mimi Leder who also directed "Deep Impact," one of 
the most unapologetic tearjerkers of our time. I didn't think the level of 
pandering and sappiness in that movie could ever be topped but I 
underestimated Leder. Maybe it's not her fault for how ridiculously 
over-the-top the ending to this movie is, but I'd like to think one of the 
producers might have suggested a better way to end it. For all its 
philosophies and ideas about goodness and kindness in the world "Pay It 
Forward" can't come up with a single positive and realistic illustration of 
its themes and instead cops out by trying to send you home weeping. </P>
<P>I don't think "Pay It Forward" is going to be a hit. I think people are going 
to see right through it. I hate to stomp on a movie but at the end of this 
one so many people in the cinema were making that "tsk" sound it was like 
being in the cricket house at the zoo. </P>
