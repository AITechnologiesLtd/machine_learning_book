<PRE>REVIEW: Anaconda
By Luke Buckmaster (<A HREF="mailto:bucky@alphalink.com.au">bucky@alphalink.com.au</A>)</PRE>
<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 and a half stars</P>
<P>For the Hollywood industry, a giant snake really isn't that big a deal.
We've already been treated to rampaging dinosaurs, vicious lions, hungry
sharks and even human devouring aliens - so a snake, or "anaconda",
doesn't seem that appealing amongst the crowd of successful thriller
vehicles.  But people love to be scared; the fear industry is profitable
as movie goers constantly flock to the cinema in the hope of being
scared witless.</P>
<P>Anaconda does in many ways complete all that it sets out to do; it has
an eerie and sinister approach and has the same sort of tension, and
corniness, that Jaws and many others have been infamous for.  However
this alone is not even close to adequate for the dismal plot to got
unnoticed, leaving a lot to be desired even in this type of film.</P>
<P>The Anaconda heroes and villains are all together trapped inside a
Jaws-like boat, which leaves no room for decent character development,
or more to point, it shows none.  The entire film is not protective of
its main characters nearly as much as it should be - many die but nobody
really cares because we all came to see the snakes anyway, which are
quite obviously the stars of the movie.</P>
<P>Aside from all of this, I must admit that I did enjoy watching most of
Anaconda.  Amongst all the disappointing acting and horrific animation
of the water bound beasts, this film is surprisingly appealing due to
the sheer innocence and almost kiddish style in which it's portrayed.
Anaconda follows in the footsteps of just about every scary film
created, bringing the true essence of fear and suspense to the silver
screen the traditional and effective way.  I guess the only difference
is after walking away from Jaws you feared the water and creatures
within it, but after seeing Anaconda I sneered at the thought of a 3
metre computer-generate piece of fluff ever existing.  But that just
makes it all the more fun.</P>
