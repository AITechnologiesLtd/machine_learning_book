"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Denzel Washington's latest picture is – surprise – another `Denzel
against the world' film.  In the last five years, the
forty-five-year-old actor has been in seven films where he has played
either a cop, a military man or the victim of some horrible racial
injustice.  In each of these films, Denzel's straight-laced character
has to fight an uphill battle against a seemingly insurmountable force.
It's getting pretty tired.  Aren't there any juicy bad guy roles he can
play?</P>
<P>Luckily, Denzel's fondness for tackling only likeable roles doesn't
hamper his latest picture too badly.  In Remember the Titans, which was
based on a true story, Mr. Washington plays the head football coach of a
recently integrated school in the early seventies.  He has to contend
with the bigoted crackers in his new town, as well as his racially
divided team.</P>
<P>Set in Alexandria, Virginia in summer of 1971, Titans begins be showing
the racial tension caused by recent laws forbidding segregation.  For
the upcoming school year, Alexandria combined three local high schools
into one new integrated location – T.C. Williams High.  Coach Boone
(Washington, The Hurricane), who was a winning football instructor in
North Carolina, was reassigned to T.C. William's head coaching position
by the local school board (how a local school board can reassign a coach
from a different state is beyond me).</P>
<P>Coach Yoast (Will Patton, Gone in 60 Seconds) is the lame duck coach of
the T.C. William Titans (how a new school can have an existing coach is
also beyond me).  He's also a successful instructor of the game and a
beloved member of the community, but still loses his job to what must
have been one of the earliest cases of affirmative action.  It quickly
becomes clear that the football program will be a racially divided, with
Boone and the black players on one side, and Yoast and the white players
on the other.</P>
<P>But Coach Boone isn't just a football coach.  He's also an apparent
expert in race relations, who marched with Martin Luther King and stood
toe to toe with the Klan.  After an intensive summer training camp,
Boone has his Titan players begin working together as a team after
dividing them by offense and defense, instead of by race.  After weeks
of hating each other, the Titans inexplicably seem to unite over a
Marvin Gaye song and a contest where they rank out each other's moms.</P>
<P>When the school year finally starts, T.C. Williams is still bursting
with racial tension.  Coach Boone finds out that he'll be fired if he
loses one game, and the Titans begin their improbable run toward the
state championship.  Improbable, that is, if you've never seen an
inspirational sport film in your life.</P>
<P>Among the problems already listed above, it seemed odd for Titans to
never bring up Viet Nam.  The film has a really hokey epilogue, but I
guess you can't fault it if it's based on a true story.  Of the Titan
players, Donald Faison (Felicity) stands out as the loud-mouthed running
back-turned-defensive back.  Also of note is the performance of Hayden
Panettiere (The Guiding Light), who plays the precocious nine-year-old
daughter of Coach Yoast.  Washington and Patton capably handle their
roles, but there isn't much to them, other than a few funny one-liners.</P>
<P>Titans was directed by Boaz Yakin (A Price Above Rubies) and is the
writing debut of Gregory Allen Howard.  The film was produced by Jerry
Bruckheimer, who generally only makes big, noisy summer pictures that
make a ton of money.  Titans games scenes are pretty well-done, thanks
to the snappy editing of Philippe Rousselot (Random Hearts).  Yes'
Trevor Rabin (a Bruckheimer staple) provides an annoying, heavy-handed
score that lets you know when you're supposed to feel various emotions.</P>
<P>1:53 – PG for mild adult language - mostly racial epithets</P>
