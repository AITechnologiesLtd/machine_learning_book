<P>PLOT:
A mom and daughter team work together to con men into loving them, cheating
on them and then paying them upon divorce. But what happens when they
actually fall in love with their potential conquests? Find out when you
watch the movie.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Despite its faults and "video movie" feel, I'd still slightly recommend this
movie because of its enjoyable premise, the two fun performances from Ray
Liotta and Gene Hackman, and the two other fun performances from Jennifer
Love Hewitt's breasts! C'mon everybody, let's all stand up and give those
puppies their rightful due <insert smattering of applause here>. Okay, now
that I've gotten that out of the way, let's see what else this film had to
offer. Well, to start off with, I liked the whole mother/daughter
relationship between Weaver and Hewitt. I bought it and I liked the back and
forth bickering. I also loved the performance by Gene Hackman, who literally
stole every scene that he was in, as the old guy with a peculiar affection
for anyone who smokes. Very funny! I only wish there were more of him to go
around. Which brings me to my next point. Even though the general premise of
this movie is a good one, the filmmakers here seemed to think that over two
hours of it was required, so the last thirty minutes of the film ends up
feeling a little stretched, as the basic idea gets regurgitated over and
over again. I mean, how many times can the same guy fall for the same con?
There's also the disappearance of a very likeable character, which kind of
took me out of the movie as well.</P>
<P>But for the most part, the flick has enough laughs and funny moments to get
you by. The soundtrack also helps, with an upbeat tempo, and plenty of
sorted cool tunes. And being a fan of Jason Lee personally, it was also nice
to see him paying the rent as the "love interest". In fact, I even bought
most of the romance stuff between him and Jennifer Love. But despite some
stuff working in this movie, some other stuff could've been improved. The
dark nature of the film's premise could've really been milked with some
nasty black comedy, but the filmmakers decided to play the "safe card" with
this one, which is unfortunate because I really think that the extra spice
would have made this film so much better. The length of the film also hurt
its overall potency, and the ordinary nature of the comedy, which was for
the most part, so-so. I did however crack up at a few key scenes, including
one with SNL alumnus Kevin Nealon and some pretty funny lines, like the one
in which Liotta's character is asked whether he can "get rid of a dead body"
and he replies "I'm from Jersey, ain't I?" The film also has a handful of
cameos, including some small parts from Jeffrey Jones, Carrie Fisher and
Anna Bancroft. On the whole, the film is probably good-natured and safe
enough for most people to enjoy, and let's face it, nobody is going for an
Oscar here.</P>
<P>The film has enough laughs, entertaining co-performances from the conned men
and an interesting premise to definitely recommend on video. And as for
those contemplating a nite out at the movies with this one, I'd say to rest
your decision on whether or not you would like to see Hewitt's tremendous
figure on the big screen for two hours+ and whether or not you're just
looking for some flighty downtime. If so, then by all means, grab a box of
kleenex, a box o' nachos, a long raincoat and have a blast! And oh yeah, for
the ladies, we do get an impressive scene with Ray Liotta in his skivvies,
and uhhhh, yeah...the man's a packin'! Broke my heart, I tell ya... : )</P>
