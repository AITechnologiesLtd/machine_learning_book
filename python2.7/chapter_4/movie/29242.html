<PRE>LE SAMOURAI (1967)
(THE GODSON) (1967)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>Recent flood of serial killer films from Hollywood might
tell otherwise, but the most fascinating category of movie
criminals is the professional assassins. This becomes
evident when the said assassins are the movie protagonists.
Filmmakers are often struggling to reconcile the morally
objectionable nature of the said profession - taking of
human lives in cold blood - and the almost mystical skills
that allow the assassins to remain professionals in the
first place. So, it's not very surprising that many films
end up mystifying and glamorising this immoral trade,
turning the hitmen as the incarnation of the "cool". For
some, 1980s Hong Kong action films started the trend, but
their inspiration came in the form of a film from another
time and another place - LE SAMOURAI, 1967 ultra-stylish
crime drama by great French director Jean-Pierre Melville.</P>
<P>The protagonist of the film is Jef Costello (played by Alain
Delon), hitman who is hired to kill Parisian nightclub
owner. Jef has never been caught, and this is due to his
methodical approach to the job - the contracts are always
arranged through intermediaries, the weapons and means of
transportation are always disposable, the hits are
well-planned while his girlfriend Jane Lagrange (played by
Nathalie Delon, Alain Delon's wife at the time) and couple
of underworld associates always provide nearly perfect
alibis. The plan unfolds almost flawlessly, except in the
moment when the lady pianist (played by Cathy Rosier)
happens to spot Jef immediately after the murder. Jef is
afterwards picked by the police among dozens of potential
suspects and quickly becomes the focus of attention of the
Police Superintendent (played by Fran‡ois P‚rier). The
pianist, however, for some strange reason fails to recognise
Jef and he gets released, only to become the target of the
assassination attempt himself. Jef, realising that the
people who ordered the hit are restless and want to silence
him, wants to find them and the pianist seem to be the key
to the mystery. In the meantime, he must evade police,
determined to find any excuse to put him back to jail.</P>
<P>At first glance, LE SAMOURAI looks like a film that in many
ways glamorises the profession of contract killer. Young and
charismatic Alain Delon with his fedora and overcoat looks a
predecessor of Chow Yun-Fat and other "cool" hitmen we have
seen in past few decades. But this impression is only
superficial. All those who allow themselves to be drawn in
the world of LE SAMOURAI would find that the film shows the
other side of the coin. The nature of the profession, with
the constant risk of capture by police or betrayal by
criminal associates, leads to distrust and constant
paranoia, and, in the end, the said individuals might look
glamorous, but inside they are lonely, emotionally crippled
and unhappy. All that can fill this emptiness is the job
itself, and the missing emotional links to other humans are
compensated with the perverted professional code, in some
way similar to Bushido (which Melville deliberately
misquotes in the opening scene of the film). This impression
could be read through the face of Alain Delon who never
smiles thought the whole course of the film, and whose stone
face hardly displays any emotion at all. The cold, grey
interior sets of his character's home, as well as rain and
cloudy sky over Paris creates the atmosphere that enhances
this effect.</P>
<P>Melville, stripped the story to the bone, in a same way he
did it with the title character. The other characters, even
those who are important to the story, are one-dimensional,
but this actually suits the purposes of this ascetic film.
There are few exceptions to this. One is the character of
Police Superintendent (superbly played by Fran‡ois P‚rier),
whose determination to bring Jef down leads him to
occasional emotional outbursts, as well as use of blackmail.
The other is character of Jane Lagrange, who allows herself
some genuine feelings for Jef and, consequently, protects
him against her better judgement. Although both of them
hardly display strong emotions under Melville's minimalist
style, those emotions are there, providing strong contrast
with Jef and his cold, sad existence.</P>
<P>The direction of the film, however, isn't as perfect as this
movie's almost legendary status would indicate. There are
some memorable scenes - the hit, police line-up, Jef's cat
and mouse game with police detectives in Parisian Metro, and
the great finale - but LE SAMOURAI, while being a truly
great film, is far from masterpiece. The main reason is in
the pace, which is at times unbearably slow, even for those
viewers accustomed to pre-MTV standards. There are some
scenes that seem overlong (especially the one featuring two
police detectives planting listening devices in Jef's
apartment), and because of them LE SAMOURAI sometimes looks
like a cure for insomnia. However, apart from those scenes,
LE SAMOURAI, with great acting, superb settings, simple and
effective story, remains one of the better examples of genre
cinema and it should be recommended even to viewers who
aren't interested in finding sources of John Woo's and
Quentin Tarantino's inspiration.</P>
