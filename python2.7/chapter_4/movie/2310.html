<PRE>                        GERONIMO: AN AMERICAN LEGEND
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Jason Patric, Gene Hackman, Robert Duvall, Wes Studi,
           Matt Damon.
Screenplay:  John Milius and Larry Gross.
Director:  Walter Hill.</P>
<P>     To paraphrase the old song, and to make a distressing confession,
I don't know much about history.  When approaching a film based on
historical subject matter, I rarely find myself basing my critique on
accuracy, for better or worse.  Nevertheless, I had a feeling I was
going to have a problem with GERONIMO: AN AMERICAN LEGEND as sool as I
noted that Wes Studi, who portrays the title character, had been given
fourth billing.  As authentic as it looks, GERONIMO just doesn't click
because it doesn't make its principal character the focus of the
story.  Like DANCES WITH WOLVES, it's not so much a story about Native
Americans as it is about guilty white men.</P>
<P>     GERONIMO: AN AMERICAN LEGEND is narrated by 2nd Lt. Britton Davis
(Matt Damon), a fresh-out-of-West Point officer assigned to the 6th
Cavalry responsible for re-settling Apaches in the American Southwest
on reservations.  The only resisters are the Chirokawa Apache, led by
Geronimo (Wes Studi).  Geronimo surrenders himself to sympathetic 1st
Lt. Charles Gatewood (Jason Patric) and Gen. George Crook (Gene
Hackman) as the film opens, but an incident on the Turkey Creek
Reservation enrages Geronimo.  He breaks off with a small band of
warriors and begins a violent series of raids on both sides of the
U.S.-Mexican border.  Gatewood, Davis and veteran Indian tracker Al
Sieber (Robert Duvall) attempt to track down the Apaches and make a
deal the U.S. has no intention of keeping.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the most glaring problem with the script for GERONIMO is
that it doesn't seem to have a direction or a clear enough sense of its
point of view.  Although the narration is coming from Davis, GERONIMO
is not a first-person narrative.  Much takes place without him present,
so it's difficult to see events as they develop as somehow having an
impact on Davis.  When Davis gives an impassioned statement near the
end of the film about his shame at the government's treatment of the
Apache, I found myself wondering why he was the one to get that scene.
As questionable as the decision to let the story come from a white man
might be, GERONIMO at least should have had the conviction to show us
more through his eyes once that decision was made, so that Davis' loss
of innocence makes sense.</P>
<P>     Screenwriters John Milius and Larry Gross also do a less than
impressive job of making Geronimo himself come alive.  Wes Studi is
grim-faced and taciturn, but his anger is never real enough.  Perhaps
out of some fear of making him too unsympathetic, they show Geronimo
actually killing unarmed settlers only once, and that scene is given a
"they asked for it quality."  Geronimo is treated more as a symbol than
a man, and I came away from the film with very little insight into his
character.</P>
<P>     All this is not to say that GERONIMO doesn't do many things
right.  Cinematographer Lloyd Ahern does some of the year's finest
work, capturing the Southwestern deserts in rich reds and oranges.
Director Walter Hill (THE LONG RIDERS) and Milius (CONAN THE BARBARIAN,
APOCALYPSE NOW) are veterans of bloody cinema, and their battle scenes
are well choreographed.  Gene Hackman and Robert Duvall both turn in
typically marvelous performances, finding much more nuance than the
script provides, and their one scene together is truly great work.  Ry
Cooder's score is also noteworthy.  In fact, everything about GERONIMO
screams "epic," but somewhere along the line a fair amount of substance
leaked out of the stylish wrapper.</P>
<P>     GERONIMO: AN AMERICAN LEGEND clocks in at about 1:55, short by the
standards of the holidays' other big releases, yet it seemed much
longer.  A barroom showdown with a group of bounty hunters didn't seem
to serve any real purpose, and the editing generally seemed
disjointed.  GERONIMO wants to be revisionist, but it doesn't provide
enough real information, or compelling enough characters to make me
care.  Somewhere amidst the cliches is the story of a warrior who
fought and killed for what was being taken from him, but it didn't make
it to the screen in this version.  In a case of an extremely misleading
title, GERONIMO: AN AMERICAN LEGEND doesn't do enough to make a real
historical figure real.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 reservations:  5.</PRE>
