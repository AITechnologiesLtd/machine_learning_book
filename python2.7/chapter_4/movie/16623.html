<P>In the wake of the Watergate scandal of the '70's, Hollywood
produced a number of first rate paranoid conspiracy thrillers.  Films
such as The Parallax View (1974), The Conversation (1974), and Three
Days Of The Condor (1975), etc, called into question the government's
integrity and accountability, and astutely tapped into the mounting
sense of public disillusionment with officialdom.  Enemy Of The State
combines the best elements of these into the formula of a gripping and
exciting high tech chase thriller.</P>
<P>The film also raises some disturbing questions about the use
and blatant abuse of power by government agencies and the covert
erosion of democracy.  Writer David Marconi (who recently collaborated
on the Mission: Impossible sequel) provides plenty of insight into the
devious, high tech world of espionage.  This polished, taut and
unsettling thriller from gun producer Jerry Bruckheimer (The Rock,
Armageddon, etc) and director Tony Scott (Top Gun, Crimson Tide, etc)
is a welcome addition to the genre.  With Scott at the helm though,
the emphasis is definitely on heart stopping action, and there is
plenty of that.</P>
<P>The film kicks into gear when ambitious NSA administrator
Thomas Reynolds (Jon Voight) murders a congressman (an unbilled Jason
Robards) who opposes legislation that will increase the powers of the
omnipresent agency to spy on private citizens.  Unfortunately, the
murder is captured on film by an environmentalist (Jason Lee), who
becomes a target of Reynold's private hit squad.</P>
<P>However, the incriminating film finds its way into the hands
of lawyer Robert Dean (Will Smith), who is involved in a nasty case
involving heavy weight union thugs.  Dean suddenly finds himself
pursued by the NSA.  His life and reputation destroyed as they set out
to discredit him before he can expose the truth.  His only hope for
survival is the enigmatic Brill (Gene Hackman), an embittered ex- spy,
a dinosaur who has largely managed to remain underground for twenty
years.  Enemy Of The State is the antithesis of the typical buddy
formula, and the volatile relationship between Dean and Brill adds to
the dangerous situation.</P>
<P>Smith delivers a strong performance as the innocent citizen on
the run from government agencies and unsure of whom he can trust.  His
physically demanding role here is a change of pace from the confident,
wise-cracking persona he has projected in recent films.  Hackman
delivers his usual solid performance, although Brill bears some
resemblance to his eavesdropping private eye from The Conversation,
although twenty years on, and much more aggressive and willing to take
the fight up to his enemies.</P>
<P>Voight relishes this opportunity to play another villain, and
is convincingly suave, yet sleazy and sinister at the same time.  His
private hit squad is played by a cast of hot shot rising young stars,
including Barry Pepper (from Saving Private Ryan), Jake Busey, Scott
Caan, and Loren Dean (recently seen in Gattaca).  Gabriel Byrne
contributes a brief cameo, while Tom Sizemore appears uncredited as
Pintero, a union thug who plays a crucial role in events.</P>
<P>Scott really knows how to make solid and exciting commercial
thrillers, and he is in fine form here.  His direction is slick and
energetic, and he demonstrates an assured command of the cutting edge
technology available to the intelligence community.  The numerous
exciting chase sequences and narrow escapes are superbly staged, and
will have the adrenaline pumping.  Scott maintains a punishing pace
throughout that will have audiences on the edge of their seats.  He
has shot much of the action on the streets of Baltimore, bringing a
sense of urgency and realism to the material.</P>
