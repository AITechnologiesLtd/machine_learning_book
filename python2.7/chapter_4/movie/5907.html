<PRE>                                THE PIANO
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<PRE>         [This is one of my golden oldies reviews - written years
          ago when I was just getting started and never posted.
          I stand by the conclusions, but in most cases many details
          are missing that I would normally include today.]</PRE>
<P>     Saw THE PIANO (***) on Friday night.  If you thought how wonderful
it would be living in New Zealand a hundred years ago, this movie will
disabuse you of that notion.  This is a dark and depressing show about
the evils of life.  Depressing shows can be quite rewarding as this
film proves.</P>
<P>    Holly Hunter without her Southern or any accent (she does not talk)
nevertheless gives an award winning performance.  She is one of my
favorite actresses.  Her best for me will always be BROADCAST NEWS.</P>
<P>     Sam Neill is very good as a husband with an IQ about equal to his
age.  He was mean yet somehow you managed to feel sorry for him at
times because he just did not seem to have the brains to know better.
Harvey Keitel was excellent as the, well, as the boy friend I guess you
might say.</P>
<P>     I wish they had ended the show in a slightly different way a few
minutes before it actually ended.  If you see the show, you will know
where I mean.</P>
<PRE>     DO go see it, but don't expect sweetness and light.</PRE>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
