<PRE>Boys And Girls </PRE>
<P>>From all the publicity and promotions for this movie you'd think it was going 
to be this year's "American
Pie" but just because it has Jason Biggs in it doesn't make it so. This is 
far from the zany, outrageous
comedy you think it's going to be, it's more of "When Harry Met Sally" at the 
teenage level. </P>
<P>Freddie Prinze Jr. and Claire Forlani star as two friends who met each other 
as children, bump into each
other in high school and bump into each other A LOT in college. They spend a 
lot of quality time together
and have great chemistry for a couple who are just friends (think "Will & 
Grace" without the gayness). The
film plays like a senior thesis on relationships and a lot of time is spent 
dissecting basic human attraction. </P>
<P>At times the movie goes overboard and becomes really sappy (especially at the 
end), but it's a teenage
romantic comedy so there's not many big surprises here. A good date movie but 
needs more laughs. </P>
<PRE>GRADE: B- </PRE>
