<PRE>THE BIG KAHUNA
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>THE BIG KAHUNA is about a lot of things, including God, friendship and
industrial lubricants.  In short, it's about the meaning of life as seen
from the perspective of two mid-Western, veteran, industrial lubricant
salesmen (Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito) and a fresh young kid from
research (Peter Facinelli) in town together for a convention.</P>
<P>As directed by John Swanbeck and written by Roger Rueff, based on his
play, THE BIG KAHUNA will immediately remind you of GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS,
adapted by David Mamet from his own play.  Although not as good or as
raunchy the Mamet film/play, THE BIG KAHUNA is no less ambitious.
Sometimes seeming to bite off more than it can chew, the film dares to
ask many questions but provide few answers.</P>
<P>What it does most successfully is showcase Spacey and DeVito's acting
talents.  Getting the flashiest role, Spacey, the grand master of the
art of sarcasm, plays Larry Mann, a salesman who is petrified that they
may not have a grand-enough hospitality suite to lure in "El Kahuna
Grande," their biggest potential client ever.  The quality of their hors
d'oeuvres also troubles him.</P>
<P>With the meatiest part, DeVito plays Phil Cooper, a recently divorced
man who pensively ponders what he really wants to do with his life.
Although his good friend Larry knows that success means making the big
sale, a tired and weary Phil isn't sure anymore about anything.  "You
take guys away from their wives for any length of time, and they don't
know how to behave," Phil says, supposedly talking about the other
conventioneers but probably talking more about himself now that he is
wifeless.</P>
<P>Bob (Facinelli) is the most unusual of the characters and the hardest to
peg.  He is an All-American-boy type, who wears his faithfulness to his
wife on his sleeve.  Appearing to be some sort of born-again Christian,
he feels that it's his obligation to turn conversations, including those
with customers, toward his Lord.  The story, which takes no religious
sides, makes his character the most intriguing and the biggest enigma.
One could easily read into his character that he represents salvation,
but there are other possible interpretations.</P>
<P>"You ought to apply for sainthood, Bob," Larry tells him, mockingly
uncomfortable with Bob's faith.  "Competition isn't as stiff as it used
to be."  A likable cynic, Larry loves to taunt Bob and ridicule religion
in general.  "You don't smoke," Larry says to Phil.  "I don't drink.
And Bob here doesn't lust after women.  Between the three of us here,
we're practically Jesus!"</P>
<P>Basically a filmed play, the movie happens almost entirely in a single
room, which is both a blessing and a curse.  Although it can be
claustrophobic, this approach focuses our attention on the acting and
the script and away from such diversions as supporting characters,
props, camerawork and all of the other trappings of traditional motion
pictures.  Most films would quickly become stuffy with this limiting
approach, but it is a tribute to the sharpness of the acting and the
dialog that THE BIG KAHUNA rarely does.  In fact, it is only when the
director tries to open up the play just a bit by including a few brief
dream sequences that the movie goes seriously awry.</P>
<P>A hard-core non-believer, Larry resists attempts to suggest that life
has a bigger purpose than closing the next big sale.  In one of the
movie's best interchanges, Phil suggests certain possibilities to Larry.
"Strange things happen," Phil tells him in summation.  "No they don't,
not unless they're printed in USA TODAY first."</P>
<P>THE BIG KAHUNA runs a fast 1:30.  It is rated R for language and would
be acceptable for most teenagers.</P>
