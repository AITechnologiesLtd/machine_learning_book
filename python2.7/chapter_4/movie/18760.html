<PRE>                  AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     James Bond is back – NOT! – as one vaguely remembered star of stage
and screen might have said.</P>
<P>     Instead of Bond, it's super-groovy spy Austin Powers (Myers) making
his triumphant return to the silver screen, the British secret agent
frozen in the 60's and thawed in the 90's, where/when he returned to
active duty.  THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME picks up right where the original
left off, with Dr. Evil (also Myers) banished to space in his Big Boy
statue/spaceship, and Austin settling down with new wife Vanessa
(Elizabeth Hurley, in a cameo re-appearance).</P>
<P>     Alas, Dr. Evil will not stay in exile for long.  He soon returns to
earth, where he hatches a plan to travel back to 1969 and `steal
Austin's mojo' – mojo that looks a bit like raspberry jam.</P>
<P>     It's up to Austin to travel back in time himself to get his mojo
back, of course, and it's back in '69 that he meets up with American CIA
agent Felicity Shagwell (Graham), goes on a wild car chase or two, faces
off with a new villain named Fat Bastard (also Myers), goes toe to toe
with a midget clone of Dr. Evil (Troyer), and ends up on the moon to
spoil the plan to build a, ahem, `Death Star' set to wipe out
Washington, D.C.</P>
<P>     Naturally, *none* of this is taken seriously, and AP2 takes the
farce to new heights (and lows).  Is THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME as good as
the original?  Actually, it's better by quite a bit.  While the original
was fun, it was too much about the one character of Austin and how out
of place he was.  The follow-up is much better-handled, with plenty of
fun characters (I loved Green as Dr. Evil's son, again) and some really
shagadelic situations.  See, it's catching.</P>
<P>     Problems?  In a shocker, it turns out that Heather Graham just
can't do comedy.  And while I won't deny that Heather is extremely hot,
she ends up weighing down the movie considerably with her seriousness
and deadpan line delivery.  Yawn.  Also, the Fat Bastard character is
quite an exercise in makeup technology, but haven't we gotten past the
point of mocking grossly overweight people?  And the Scottish thing?
Come on, Mike.  That one's older than Sprockets.</P>
<P>     While AP2 feels a bit like it was written in one night while under
the influence of controlled substances, I can't deny that it's really,
really funny.  The first 20 minutes represent the most I've laughed at a
film this year.  And I saw WING COMMANDER, don't forget.</P>
<P>     Stay to the end.  There are a couple of credits-running scenes you
really have to see.  Also notable are the two `Jerry Springer'
recreations (with Springer himself).  I'll leave you with a fun fact:
Did you know that Demi Moore was a producer on this film?  Did you know
that Demi Moore was a producer at all?</P>
