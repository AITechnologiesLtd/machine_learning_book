<P>Alexei Balabanov's "Brother," now showing at NYC's Film Forum, is the
first post-Soviet film that accurately reflects life after the fall of
Communism. This cynical, hard-boiled gangster film does not deal in
nostalgia for some glorious Stalinist past, however. Like many new
post-Soviet intellectuals, Balabanov is mesmerized by the callous and
hedonistic society taking shape. The brave new world of drugs,
rock-and-roll, crime and nihilism might be dragging the world down
around them, but the characters in "Brother" plan to have a good time
in the process, like a party on the deck of the sinking Titanic.</P>
<P>Danila (played by Sergei Bodrov, Russia's hottest new actor) has just
arrived in St. Petersburg, formerly Leningrad, to look up his older
brother Viktor (Victor Sohurukov), a free-lance hit-man. Danila has
just finished serving in the Russian army and is unemployed. Without
any fanfare, Viktor drafts his younger brother into the family
business. Viktor asks him if he was taught how to shoot a gun in the
army. The laconic younger brother replies that they took him to the
firing range like everybody else, but he spent most of his time at
h.q.</P>
<P>The running joke of the entire film is that the baby-faced,
sweet-natured younger brother turns out to be the most proficient
killing machine since Rambo. Although he never brags about his
prowess, clearly he has become an expert on the battlefields of
Chechnya or some other post-Soviet killing ground. It is in fact a
Chechen gangster who is Danila's first target. Danila first rents a
room downtown near the market where the Chechen gang boss takes his
morning constitutional and kickbacks from merchants. He then stakes
out the area in disguise, and once he settles on a plan, goes back to
his room where he constructs a bomb made of matchstick heads and
gunpowder to use against the Chechen.</P>
<P>When Danila is not busy killing bad guys, he behaves like any young
Russian. He listens to his favorite rock-and-roll music, played by the
Russian group Nautilus, on his beloved Sony Walkman. He picks up a
street drug peddler after getting paid for his first hit. The
punked-out young woman takes him first to a disco and then to a
private party where everybody is smoking pot, drinking vodka from the
bottle and listening to the latest rock-and-roll. All the young
murderer wants to do is talk about his favorite band, Nautilus.</P>
<P>The telephone wakes Danila early next morning, in the middle of a
terrible hangover. His brother has lined up another job for him. He is
to accompany two creepy hit-men on a raid against a rival gangster.
When they burst in to his apartment, only one of his underlings is
there, whom they bind and gag. Danila asks the other hit-men and the
captive if they have any aspirin. When they reply no, he wanders into
a party in progress upstairs. People are listening to rock-and-roll,
smoking pot, playing pool and conversing pleasantly. They give him
some aspirin and invite him to stay and enjoy himself but he can't
stay because he has business downstairs that must be taken care of.</P>
<P>After returning downstairs to rejoin his fellow killers, he answers a
knock at the door. It turns out to be a invitee to the party upstairs
who has wandered into the wrong place. They pull him into the
apartment and tell him to keep quiet and he won't be harmed. It turns
out that the new captive is a music video director whom Danila
immediately befriends. He also promises him that no harm will come to
him as long as he is there. He then starts to pump the terrified man
all about the music business and raves to him about Nautilus, his
favorite group.</P>
<P>After several hours, when it becomes clear that their intended target
is not going to show up, Danila's fellow hit-men stab the bound and
gagged lieutenant to death. Just as they are about to do the same
thing to the director, Danila intervenes and kills them instead. He
tells the frightened director that he always keeps his promises.</P>
<P>Danila might be a professional killer, but true to gangster film
formalism, he is a professional killer with a heart. In an earlier
scene, he steps into a confrontation between a cowed streetcar
conductor and two hooligans who refuse to pay their fare. He sticks a
gun in their face and makes them pay their fare. Danila's attitude
must strike a strong chord in Russian audiences, who have made this
the highest-grossing film of 1997. Perhaps the only way to deal with
the scum of Russian society is through vigilante action, like the kind
celebrated in Charles Bronson's "Death Wish" films.</P>
<P>Balabanov has clearly immersed himself in American B movies and has
made a movie to compete with them on their own terms. But "Brother"
has more intelligence than this. You sympathize with the main
character, who has lost his moral moorings, because the rest of
society has also. There is no other way to survive. Danila allows
himself to get sucked into the jungle, but tries at the same time to
preserve his own integrity. More than any other professional killer in
cinema history, Danila will remind one of the samurai Toshiro Mifune
played in Yojimbo and Sanjuro. The out-of-work swordsman hires himself
out to gangsters and warlords who are making life hell for the
peasants, but brings peace by killing the rivals, one faction after
another.</P>
<P>Organized crime in the former Soviet Union is not only a inviting
topic for film-makers, it is also a genuine problem for those trying
to introduce capitalism there. Fred Weir writes in "Revolution from
Above" that 70 to 80 percent of private industrial and financial
institutions are forced to make payments of 10 to 20 percent of their
annual revenues to organized crime. Two members of the Russian
parliament were murdered by hit-men during 1994-95. Even more
alarmingly for those of us living in New York City or wherever real
estate is at a premium, Weir states that some residents of
well-located Moscow apartments have been murdered in scams aimed at
obtaining ownership of newly privatized apartments.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Russia has just received a $20 billion IMF loan, which
nobody expects to bring the ailing economy to life. Gangsterism will
not disappear either, since it is endemic to the sort of capitalism
that is taking root there. In a society that worships material success
but that does not give outsiders a means to such success, criminality
is just another way to succeed. Meanwhile there is convincing evidence
that drugs are as important to the Mexican economy as oil is to Saudi
Arabia. The downwardly spiraling world economy practically insures
that crime will continue to be big business in Russia and the rest of
the world.</P>
