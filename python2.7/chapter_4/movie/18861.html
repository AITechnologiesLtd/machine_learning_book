<P>Rarely does a film live up to its hype quite the way this one does.
Blair Witch roared out of Sundance with buzz calling it the scariest
movie ever made.  I am prepared to not only back up that statement, but
to add that it will likely be the scariest movie that will ever be
made.  At least in my lifetime.  And I'm relatively young.</P>
<P>This isn't your average teen slasher flick with a cast raided from the
ranks of the WB.  Blair Witch is an extremely low-budget experiment by
first-timers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez.  Their premise is
simple: Three student filmmakers venture into the woods near
Burkitsville, Maryland to make a documentary about a local legend known
as the Blair Witch.  They are never seen again and what the viewer is
watching is their film footage, which has just been recovered one year
later.</P>
<P>Don't let the trailers fool you – only the last five seconds of them are
culled from the film.  The rest has all been added to make the incident
seem more dramatic and real, which it's not.  Well, it's not really
real.  The film you're watching is the actual film shot by these three
kids.  The directors sent them into the woods armed with a home video
camera, a 16mm black-and-white camera and a DAT recorder, with only
vague directions and no real idea of what might happen to them.  So you
see and hear everything that happens as it happens.  It is more
improvising then acting, and when these people are terrified, they are
genuinely terrified.</P>
<P>The film begins slowly, but once it takes off, you'll be on the ride of
your life.  Blair Witch opens with the kids interviewing local residents
of the small town about their knowledge of the legend.  Then they
venture off into the forest with the intention of spending a couple of
days and nights filming a few of the places where the Blair Witch was
reported to have wreaked havoc on innocent townsfolk that dared venture
into her woods.  They see the graves of several children, and they find
the rock from which several fishermen reportedly disappeared.</P>
<P>The first night is uneventful – Josh thinks he heard something, but the
others (Heather and Michael) just laugh it off, thinking that he's just
trying to spook them.  The next night, the sound is louder and heard by
all three.  By the third night, the group has lost their map, has no
idea of their location are and literally run screaming from their tent
as something appears to be attacking it from the outside.  Then it gets
really scary.  Hell, `scary' isn't a strong enough word.  I don't think
a strong enough word exists.  There are no scary monsters, splattered
blood or musical crescendos to make you jump, but I still found my heart
pounding out of my chest, my hands covering my mouth and my stomach
nauseous.  And I love scary movies.</P>
<P>The ending of the film is so disturbing that it can't be described.
It's been several weeks since I've seen the film and I still can't get
Heather's screaming out of my head.  She doesn't seem to be acting; it
sounds like the actual screams of a person that thinks she's going to
die.  It's more than a little sick, but it's more effective than
anything you've ever seen or heard.  When the credits rolled, I sat
slumped on my seat with my mouth hanging open, thunderstruck from what I
had just witnessed.  It took me several seconds to realize that I wasn't
breathing.  And I wanted to see it again.  Immediately.</P>
<P>Do not miss this film for any reason.  See it at night.  Park in an
isolated spot in the back of the theater and try not to soil yourself as
you walk back to your car.  This isn't Scream, where you were laughing
on the way home.  This is serious, hardcore terror and is definitely not
for the weak-hearted.  (1:29 - R for language and psychological horror
that you will never be able to escape.  Ever)</P>
