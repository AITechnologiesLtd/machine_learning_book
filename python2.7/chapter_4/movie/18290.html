<P>A man has his life broadcast to an eager television audience,
twenty-four hours a day.  This premise sounds remarkably similar to
last year's brilliant The Truman Show.  (It is also a concept that the
ABC embraced with its warts-and-all reality-based documentary series
Sylvania Waters a decade ago.)  Although Edtv may recall The Truman
Show, it is actually based on a little known 1994 French/Canadian film
entitled Louis 19: Le Roi Des Ondes (Louis 19: King Of The Airwaves).
What also separates Edtv from The Truman Show is that, in this comedy,
the central character is fully aware of the intrusive presence of the
cameras from the start.</P>
<P>Cable station True TV is struggling in the ratings, even being
beaten by The Gardening Channel, and the programming executives decide
to beef up their image.  They decide to follow one ordinary person's
life on camera, twenty-four hours a day, live, unrehearsed, unscripted
and unedited.  Video store clerk Ed Pekurney (Matthew McConaughey,
from Lone Star, A Time To Kill, etc) is chosen from the audition
tapes, mainly because of his down to earth charm, his sex appeal and
his goof ball sense of humour.  Unexpectedly, Ed becomes a sensation,
and the audience for this reality based family soap opera grows.  But
under the unflinching scrutiny of the tv cameras, a number of
skeletons start rattling out of the Pekurney family closet.  Network
executives are also only too willing to manufacture events in Ed's
life to increase audience interest and thus further boost their
ratings.</P>
<P>Ed finds himself initially swept away by the euphoria of his
sudden popularity, until he discovers that being a celebrity carries
its own baggage.  This is a theme that Woody Allen explored with
limited success in his recent, occasionally self indulgent Celebrity.
Edtv brings irony and cutting wit to its cynical exploration of the
intrusive nature of the media, and the powerfully persuasive and
seductive nature of fame.  This clever film also explores how the
media exploits the American public's insatiable desire to know even
the most salacious details of the lives of celebrities.</P>
<P>Edtv reunites director Ron Howard with his two favourite
writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, who previously wrote Splash
and Parenthood for him, but the creative team seem to have stumbled
occasionally with their latest collaboration.  Howard is usually a
director with a keen gift for storytelling combined with astute
commercial instincts.  Those gifts seem to have deserted him a little
here.  Howard makes his salient points well enough, but then proceeds
to bludgeon them with sledgehammer-like subtlety.  Many scenes seem
unnecessarily repetitive, and the film could have been tightened up
considerably in the editing room.  There are also a number of ideas
that fall flat and lead nowhere in particular, contributing to the
film's bloated look.</P>
<P>As usual, Howard has assembled a top notch cast, who deliver
solid performances under his assured direction.  McConaughey is very
likeable and appealing, and he makes Ed an attractive and sympathetic
character.  Woody Harrelson delivers a solid performance as Ed's
sleazy, narcissistic brother Ray, while Martin Landau and Sally
Kellerman (from MASH, etc) lend some much needed sympathy to their
roles as Ed's parents.  Ellen De Generes is marvellous as Cynthia, the
tv executive who develops a conscience, while tv star Jenna Elfman
(Dharma And Greg) brings some depth to her role as Shari, Ed's girl
friend who finds she cannot handle the pressure of living her life in
the media spotlight.</P>
<P>Edtv has a much lighter tone than Peter Weir's similarly
themed film, and it will likely appeal more to those audiences who
couldn't embrace the concept behind his intelligent and imaginative
vision.</P>
