<P> Loser (2000) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Jason Biggs, Mena Suvari, Greg
Kinnear, Zak Orth, Tom Sadoski and Jimmi Simpson. Music by David Kitay.
Written and directed by Amy Heckerling. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P> "Loser" is no winner. This youthful comedy, written and directed by Amy
Heckerling, is rather bland actually.</P>
<P> It's also a bit sweet. But most of all, it is very uninvolving.</P>
<P> The movie gives you a feeling of deja vu, that you've seen this story
before - somewhere.</P>
<P> Maybe it is because Heckerling's characters are ill-defined, lacking
any motivation. They are mostly sketched-in types, plot devices.</P>
<PRE> They include:</PRE>
<P> - Paul Tannek (Jason Biggs), the small-town scholarship winner
attending college in the Big Apple. He's a nice guy who no one - well,
at least his three roommates - likes. Why?</P>
<P> Simple, he's at the university to study and learn, plus he wears a
funny hat.</P>
<P> Paul's a square. He neither parties nor chases women.</P>
<P> - Dora Diamond (Mena Suvari), the impressionable student having an
affair with self-centered, smarmy professor Edward Alcott (Greg
Kinnear).</P>
<P> She is blind to Paul's kindness and affection, while explaining away
the condescending manner in which she is treated by Alcott.</P>
<P>  - Adam (Zak Orth), Noah (Tom Sadoski) and Chris (Jimmi Simpson),
Paul's supposedly ultra-hip, sophisticated roommates, are slugs. They
are so dense, so uncool, that it's difficult to swallow the concept that
they are the guys others want to emulate.</P>
<P> Heckerling, by creating these three stooges as caricatures, has diluted
the very point she is trying to make.</P>
<P> Compared to those bums, Paul is a winner. And that seems to be the
film's point.
In the eyes of the audience, Paul is no loser. He is a very nice guy,
though a bit naive and too trusting.</P>
<P> But Heckerling has stacked the deck too much in his favor.</P>
<P> The three geeks are such morons they have to stoop to using date-rape
type drugs to procure women.</P>
<P> Paul, meanwhile, allows them to run roughshod over him. Why? It is
never explained. Obviously, he doesn't want to be like them, nor does he
want their companionship.</P>
<P> Paul is staying true to himself, being a good guy, helpful to others.
He is smarter than he lets on to others.</P>
<P> So the big question remains: Why at a big New York university, can Paul
only make contact with three losers, plus one flaky young woman?</P>
<P> Heckerling ignores that aspect all together.</P>
<P> The cast, however, makes the most with the material at hand.</P>
<P> Biggs, so memorable in "American Pie, "is rather passive as Paul. He is
more victim than protagonist. He plays Paul as if he were a blank slate.
You only know him as a decent, quiet guy trying to go along to get
along.</P>
<P> Suvari, who also appeared in "American Pie" and was featured in the
Oscar-winning "American Beauty, "has a problem similar to Biggs in
defining her character.</P>
<P> Obviously, she is an intelligent young woman. That is why her
attraction to, and her relationship with, her professor seems more like
a plot contrivance than an avenue her character would actually explore.</P>
<P> She seems too self-assured, too aware of herself, to accept the
belittling constantly heaped upon her by Alcott. It does not make sense.</P>
<P> "Loser" is a very predictable movie. You know what's going to happen
and who is going to wind up with whom 10 minutes into the feature.</P>
<P> It's not a very memorable movie. It's like a fast-food snack,
fulfilling at the moment, then quite forgettable.</P>
