<P>     It's bad enough to be ill on your 37th birthday, but Gillian 
(Michelle Pfeiffer) is considerably worse off.  She has been dead for 
two years, but even that impediment doesn't stop her from showing up for 
the party.  The reason she's still around is because her husband, David 
(Peter Gallagher), can't let go.  Theirs was a near-perfect love, and, 
since her death, he hasn't been able to reach a state of emotional 
equilibrium.  So he leads the life of a recluse, doing his best to care 
for his teenage daughter, Rachel (Claire Danes), while steadfastly 
refusing any relationship that looks like it could lead to a romantic 
entanglement.  When he gets especially lonely -- which is almost every 
day -- Gillian's apparition appears to him.  </P>
<P>     Hollywood is often at its worst when attempting to deal seriously 
with issues of life and death.  Since most major motion picture studios 
are most comfortable making "feel good" movies, they become skittish 
when faced with a script that confronts death.  As a result, instead of 
employing the subtlety and keen insight which would generate powerful 
results (see DEAD MAN WALKING for an example), directors typically 
resort to melodrama and manipulation.  That's one of the problems with 
TO GILLIAN ON HER 37TH BIRTHDAY.  The subject matter is emotionally-
wrenching, but it's handled unevenly, with the accent on trying to make 
the audience cry rather than feel.</P>
<P>     To its credit, there are times when TO GILLIAN gets things right.  
As a likable man who can't quite cope with his devastating loss, David 
is consistent and believable.  And, for the most part, his scenes with 
Gillian are nicely-handled.  Less sure is his relationship with his 
daughter.  At times, TO GILLIAN strikes the proper emotional chord in 
their interaction -- David loves Rachel, but he's so blinded by his own 
pain that he can't see how much he's hurting her.  Unfortunately, there 
are other instances, such as when David doesn't approve of a boyfriend, 
that play like scenes from a TV sitcom.</P>
<P>     Personally, I would have preferred a lot more interaction between 
David and Rachel, and a few more scenes with Gillian, since Michelle 
Pfeiffer fits nicely into the role.  Instead, we're given a host of 
secondary characters -- Gillian's older sister, Esther (Kathy Baker); 
her husband, Paul (Bruce Altman); a flirtatious neighborhood girl named 
Cindy (Laurie Fortier); and Kevin Danford (Wendy Crewson), a woman Paul 
and Esther have set up as a date for David.  All of these characters 
converge on David's Nantucket home for a few days of singing '70s songs 
and building sand castles.  It's "Gillian's Weekend" -- the anniversary 
of both her birth and her death.</P>
<P>     TO GILLIAN wants to use Paul and Esther as a contrast to David and 
Gillian, but it never really works.  Esther and Paul's relationship 
remains half-developed, and she in particular comes across as a bitter, 
jealous person who insists that there's something seriously wrong with 
David because he fantasizes about seeing his dead wife.  Meanwhile, 
Kevin, David's would-be-blind date, is superfluous.  The film wouldn't 
have changed one iota without her.  Performances also factor into how we 
feel about the characters -- Kathy Baker isn't very good, but both 
Gallagher and Danes are.</P>
<P>     As directed by Michael Pressman and scripted by David E. Kelley, TO 
GILLIAN ON HER 37TH BIRTHDAY has the erratic feel of a play adapted for 
the screen, which it is (Michael Brady's award-nominated production 
debuted on stage 11 years ago).  The plot jumps around and there's a 
feeling that certain relationships should be more complex than what 
we're seeing.  There are times when this movie gets on track and 
delivers a series of surprisingly effective scenes, but it doesn't 
sustain the momentum.  In fact, the likability of the main characters 
makes this inconsistency all the more frustrating.</P>
<P>     I've seen some comparisons between TO GILLIAN and GHOST, but, aside 
from the "presence" of a dead lover, there's not much connection -- this 
is a more somber, less metaphysical story.  And, despite its various 
problems, TO GILLIAN ON HER 37TH BIRTHDAY occasionally touches a core of 
emotional honesty that makes you wonder how much better it could have 
been had all the extraneous characters been jettisoned.  </P>
