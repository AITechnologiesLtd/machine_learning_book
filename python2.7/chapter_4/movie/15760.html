<PRE>                     THE GENERAL ***½ (out of four)
            -a review by Bill Chambers ( <A HREF="mailto:wchamber@netcom.ca">wchamber@netcom.ca</A> )</PRE>
<PRE>              (Season's Greetings from FILM FREAK CENTRAL:
                      <A HREF="http://filmfreakcentral.net">http://filmfreakcentral.net</A> )
starring Brendan Gleeson, Jon Voight, Adrian Dunbar, Maria Doyle Kennedy
     screenplay by John Boorman, based on the novel by Paul Williams
                        directed by John Boorman</PRE>
<P>After a screening of The General, I was approached by a journalist from
Ireland who told me how much his people loathed professional thief
Martin Cahill. Boorman's take on Cahill's life is sympathetic, but it
hardly glorifies the crook's existence. (The more powerful Cahill
becomes, the more he acts like a shut-in.) According to said journalist,
it might upset certain moviegoers in his homeland for its humane
treatment of Cahill, but after considering the film carefully, they'll
conclude the same thing he did: there just isn't any other way to tell
the story.</P>
<P>The picture opens with an innovative flashback technique: Cahill
(Gleeson) gets up in the morning, goes to his car, and before he can
pull out into the street, he is shot by a stranger-at which point the
images literally start moving in reverse; the bullet is ushered back
into the barrel of the gun, and we are transported to a time when Cahill
was a young lad (here portrayed ably The Butcher Boy's Eamonn Owens-talk
about type-casting) who robbed local markets to feed his hungry family.
Later, in a reformatory, a priest attempts to molest him-adolescent
Cahill defends himself, and is punished with slaps from the pious
pedophile. (For the rest of the film, whenever confronting figures of
authority, Cahill shields his face with his hands, skulking into a fetal
position as if trying to slide right out of his skin.)</P>
<P>Despite the constant threat of imprisonment from Police Inspector Ned
Kenny (Voight), Cahill does little to correct his rebellious ways. He is
married to the loving Francis (Kennedy) but openly carries on an affair
with her sister, Tina (Angeline Ball)-he even fathers a boy with her.
Meanwhile, he and his gang of affable hoods move from petty larceny to a
jewelry store heist and the theft of a priceless Vermeer painting. (His
innocent appreciation of art would disturb collectors, as he treats said
piece like a carnival poster.) Throughout, Cahill's disposition remains
the same: non-chalant, sometimes arrogant, but he never forgets his
roots. (A T-shirt adorned with cartoon pigs remains his preferred attire
even with millions in gold bricks at his disposal.)</P>
<P>The General was shot in black and white, and it's unforgiving in its
physical observation of these characters' craggy, lived-in faces. Seamus
Deasy's cinematography glamourizes Cahill and co. no more than Boorman's
script. Cahill was not Pretty Boy Floyd, after all; the possible key to
his adult behaviour is revealed when the townspeople applaud young
Martin's antics: here's a man who just wants to feel like a hero to a
community, no matter how small that community becomes. He fancies
himself a modern day Robin Hood-stealing from the rich but for the sake
of theatrics and not any sort of noble cause. Father to one, husband to
two, gang leader, and number one threat to Kenny's ego, Cahill was
ultimately just a son of a bitch who got carried away-few people had the
guts to rein him in. I grew to like Cahill the movie character as I
suspect I would grow to like many an outlaw in real life, because of his
conviction. Gleeson's performance is a marvel, the sort of seamless,
un-showy turn that goes largely unrewarded by the populace. By all
accounts, his impersonation of Cahill's ticks and mannerisms are
pinpoint accurate.</P>
<P>Deliverance aside, Boorman had until now not made a truly complete and
humane film. (Is it any coincidence that he and Voight, the star of
Deliverance, reunited for what might prove to be Boorman's best work?)
Perhaps all those years of editing Britain's "Projections" anthologies
have made him a more thoughtful filmmaker. Towards the end of the film,
Cahill and his son have the kind of moment many a Hollywood crime drama
wouldn't think to include-The General is like a pastiche of those bits
between killings that all too often hit the cutting room floor.</P>
