                               NO LOOKING BACK (R)
                        A Film Review By Fernando Vallejo
 _________________________________________________________</PRE>
<PRE>  RATING (OUT OF ****): **</PRE>
<P>  In 1995, THE BROTHERS McMULLEN, the feature film debut by filmmaker Edward
Burns, won the audience prize at the Sundance film festival and automatically
placed him into the limelight as one of the *hottest* young filmmakers,
virtually gearing him for a prosperous future. The film, a slight but
undeniably charming confection of three Irish Catholic brothers struggling
with their multiple rendezvous with women was a shrewd, cleverly written
account of the parallels between religion and morality.</P>
<P>  One year later, Burns crafted SHE'S THE ONE, a cloyingly cutesy comedy that
forced me to my bad side. It ran over similar territory, only this time it the
material wasn't as fresh, the acting was second-rate and the photography
abysmal. Furthermore, it made me question Burns' integrity as a filmmaker.
After all, it was his first "studio" film, one with higher goals and more
responsibilities.</P>
<P> Edward Burns' latest venture is Irish Catholic-free, which could account for
his first female protagonist in the three films his made, odd, since all of
his films have been about women. NO LOOKING BACK is a flimsy, homespun
melodrama about nasty people acting nastily towards each other.It doesn't
avoid the conventionalities presented and instead embraces the meat-and-
potatoes values their characters don't embrace. </P>
<P>  The film's humdrum setup stars Lauren Holly as Claudia, an attractive
waitress in an unnamed small East Coast town, who yearns for an alternate
existence that differs from the monotonous, draggy reality she experiences
with Michael (Jon Bon Jovi), her unimaginative and homey boyfriend whose
aspirations of marriage ultimately frighten Claudia. This hunger is further
accentuated by the return of Charlie (Edward Burns) her ex-boyfriend who left
the town to deal his cards in California, shortly after Claudia become
pregnant and opted for an abortion. Soon thereafter, Charlie abandoned her,
never really devoting himself to Claudia's full recovery. Three years later,
and with a part-time job at a gas station,  he's back with a vengeance, and
although he's informed she's "basically" engaged to Michael, his flirtation is
ceaseless. Predictably, this sets a dilemma as to wether she shall take a
chance with Charlie or maintain loyalty with Michael. </P>
<P>  Jon Bon Jovi, once again proving he's more than a capable actor, and Lauren
Holly, in her first true role she can chew on, stand out above the rest of the
vacuous cast which includes Blythe Danner as the all-wise grandmother
suffering from grandpa's bitterness (years ago, he too left the family and
flew to Vegas), Connie Britton as the sister who renders valuable advice, and
yes, Edward Burns. Bon Jovi shines with an understated performance that
underlines the character's faithfulness in Small Town, USA. It's a very
poignant piece of acting, one that will make Bon Jovi more recognizable.
Holly, with her exquisitely golden smile, gives Claudia a sweetly ethereal
touch blending the impatience of a woman who can no longer stand the same
faces and the one native side that calls for a restraint to her choices. </P>
<P>  Burns, however, clunks. Badly. Doesn't he realize, as a filmmaker and a
screenwriter, that he possesses the acting abilities of a dried-out turnip? He
casts himself, in a woefully written role, that mainly consist of charmless
smirks and witless wisecracks, designed for someone like, say, Stephen
Baldwin. "What wasn't okay?" he naively responds, after Claudia questions his
sudden departure. He constantly drinks, lies, and re-affirms his role as a
heartthrob by persuading a jailbait to rent a "motel," and letting everybody
know by displaying her at a bar at happy hour. I have no business objecting to
these moral choices, only when they interfere with the plausibility of
characters do I take a stand. And, idiotically, Claudia falls for this
routine. Which leads to an even more improbable conclusion. </P>
<P>  NO LOOKING BACK more than any Edward Burns movie, exposes what he can and
can't do as a screenwriter. At times you want him to take a more harsh
approach to the situation, a la CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS. Why should we bother
to behave morally in a universe where God may not exist, and where goodness is
so rarely rewarded? But then again, this standpoint is anti-Burns. He stays
within the frames of his stories, letting the actors do the talking and figure
it out for themselves. </P>
<P>  Despite its faults, NO LOOKING BACK isn't a complete failure. The
cinematography by Frank Prinzi is gorgeous. The film has moments of dramatic
intensity and Burns is refreshingly unpretentious and uncynical when it comes
to modeling his characters. But their trepidations, their goals, their dreams,
their "unhealthy" lifestyles are film-student cliches that Burns looked to be
done with in BROTHERS McMULLEN. But now, three years later, his self-pitying
is pitiable. (1:36)</P>
