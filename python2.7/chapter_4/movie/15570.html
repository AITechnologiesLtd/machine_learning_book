<PRE>ENEMY OF THE STATE</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of 4) - a good movie</PRE>
<P>Release Date: November 20, 1998
Starring: Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon Voight, Regina King, Loren Dean,
Jake Busey, Barry Pepper,
Gabriel Byrne, Jason Lee
Directed by: Tony Scott
Distributed by: Buena Vista Pictures
MPAA Rating: R (language, violence) </P>
<P>Lean, mean, escapist thrillers are a tough product to come by. Most are
unnecessarily complicated, and others have no sense of expediency -- the
thrill-ride effect gets lost in the cumbersome plot. Perhaps the
ultimate escapist thriller was THE FUGITIVE, which featured none of the
flash-bang effects of today's market but rather a bread-and-butter,
textbook example of what a clever script and good direction is all
about. The latest Tony Scott movie, ENEMY OF THE STATE, doesn't make it
to that level. It's a true nineties product that runs like greased
lightning through a maze of cell phones and laptop computers, without
looking back. </P>
<P>Although Director Scott has made missteps in the past, such as the lame
thriller THE FAN, he's generated a good deal of energy in pictures like
CRIMSON TIDE and TOP GUN. That vibrant spirit is present here, shown in
well-timed and carefully planned chase scenes that give the movie an
aura of sheer speed. ENEMY OF THE STATE also features an unprecedented
use of amazing cinematography -- Director of Photography Daniel Mindel
throws a staggering amount of different views, angles, lenses, and film
stocks at the audience that goes a long way toward involving the
audience in the movie. ENEMY is truly a visual experience, and that's
only one of the reasons it's such a fun watch.</P>
<P>The movie lights up with an aging senator visited by NSA deputy chief
Thomas Reynolds (Jon Voight). Reynolds wants a new communications act
passed to allow the government free reign in the use of surveilance
equipment, but the senator plans to bury the bill in committee. Reynolds
has the senator offed, but not before the murder is caught on a
naturalist's camera. By an extremist chain of events, the tape ends up
in labor lawyer Robert Dean (Will Smith)'s posession, and it's not long
before he's running from Reynolds' cronies. It's only with the help of
an ex-spook named Brill (Gene Hackman) that Dean is able to get to the
bottom of things. </P>
<P>The acting is top notch, and the three principles - Smith, Hackman, and
Voight - are generally more mature and excellent all around. Smith puts
aside the wisecracking act and becomes a normal human being; Voight
tones down the amount of sneer he puts into his character for greater
ominpotence; and Hackman is simply over the top in the mysterioso role.
Smith's regular joe comes off particularly well, as he runs from
authorties for reasons that he knows not. The supports are also in fine
form, lending credibility to the main roles and advancing the plot in
key areas. This is, for the holiday crowd, the hot ticket; as well as
anyone looking for a serving of genuine action in a market that is
otherwise lacking.</P>
