<PRE>HOME ALONE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     "When I grow up and get married, I'm going to live alone," Kevin
McCallister decides after being alternately ignored and ridiculed by a
household full of his siblings and cousins.  Rebelliously, he wishes
he'd never see his family again and that he'd be home alone.  As the
old adage goes, be careful what you wish for lest you get it and, by
implication, loathe it.  Kevin will soon be alone, very alone, but he
will end up loving it.  Even when disaster looms eminent, he will rise
to the occasion, relishing the opportunity to utilize simple household
items to defend his home.</P>
<P>     In 1990, MRS. DOUBTFIRE's director Chris Columbus, brought out the
first in the extremely popular HOME ALONE series.  Starring Macaulay
Culkin in his first big role, the movie was a hit for its slapstick
humor as well as the age-old theme of a kid who bests the grown-ups.</P>
<P>     (The problem with your kids' watching movie series is that it is
not always easy to start them with the first episode.  Although we were
able to show our son, Jeffrey, the Bond and the STAR WARS series in
order, he got out of sequence on HOME ALONE, seeing the first one
last.)</P>
<P>     Two sets of McCallister families head to Paris for their big trip.
In one of the movie's best scenes Kevin's parents, while aloft, figure
that they forgot something, but can't determine what it could it be -
perhaps they left the garage door open says the dad (John Heard).
We've all had that experience but few have had the dilemma facing them,
they forgot a child - Kevin (Culkin).  It was a simple matter of a bad
headcount on the airport shuttle and, what with the commotion of
leaving, etc., they didn't notice Kevin's absence.</P>
<P>     Rather than panicking, as his parents do when they realize what
has happened, Kevin decides he is in hog heaven.  He starts doing all
of those things that under normal circumstances he would be absolutely
forbidden to do.  Watching "rubbish" on TV while feasting on mountains
of ice cream is but one of his many sinful pleasures.</P>
<P>     Culkin displays a wide range of acting emotions.  One minute he's
a hellion, and the next he's an angel.  He is especially cute hamming
it up in front of the mirror.  Looking brave, wise, and yet vulnerable,
Culkin is perfect for the role.  Imaginative, Kevin turns on all the
lights, cranks up the stereo, and moves cardboard cutouts on his
electric train to make his house look chockfull of adults.</P>
<P>     Using relentlessly upbeat Christmas music by STAR WARS's John
Williams, the movie contrasts the joyous holiday season with the less
than ideal situation in which Kevin and his parents find themselves.</P>
<P>     In the midst of the comedy is a well-acted subplot of an old man
who no longer talks to his grown son because they lost their tempers at
each other years ago.  A sagacious Kevin gives him advice in a touching
scene in church.</P>
<P>     Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, playing two bumbling burglars, set
their sights on robbing the McCallister house.  Although the two
robbers are central to the storyline, the movie is at its best when
they are nowhere to be seen.  They cause the sweet, original movie to
dissolve into cheap slapstick that you've seen many times before.</P>
<P>     Kevin defends his home from them with everything from blowtorches
to carefully laid nails.  Mainly the two robbers fall one minute and
get knocked on the head the next, ad nauseam.  A little of Stern and
Pesci goes a long way, and HOME ALONE has them in almost every scene in
the last half of the movie. Too bad Kevin's adversaries had to be so
terminally stupid - the rest of the picture isn't.</P>
<P>     HOME ALONE runs 1:45.  It is rated PG for comic violence and would
be fine for most kids.</P>
<P>     My son Jeffrey, age 9, gave the movie ***.  Of the three HOME
ALONE episodes, he ranked them HOME ALONE 3, HOME ALONE and then HOME
ALONE 2.</P>
