<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>MGM's elegant remake of the superior 1937 version of the British
adventure film King Solomon's Mines features Stewart Granger as the
intrepid-safari guide Alan Quartermaine, and Deborah Kerr as the wealthy
English woman, Elizabeth Curtis, who is looking for her missing husband.
Richard Carlson is Elizabeth's loyal brother Jack, who accompanies her
to Africa in 1897 to see if they can locate her husband who has not
returned ever since going to Africa five years ago to search for a
secret legendary diamond mine. The only clue they have to his
whereabouts is a map he sent them.</P>
<P>Quartermaine is the best safari guide in Africa, but he has been at it
for far too long, and wishes to go back to England. His wife died six
years ago and he has a son in England, whom he wishes to see again. He
is fed up with taking rich people out on safaris and therefore turns
down the sibling's request to locate Henry Curtis. He tells them that it
is too dangerous, they will have to go to unexplored land where no white
man has been before. There is also an unfriendly savage tribe there, one
that even the local tribes avoid.
But Elizabeth offers him a more than generous $5,000 pounds up front to
be the guide. He coldly tells her that she has bought his services as a
mercenary, that this is more money than he can earn in a lifetime, and
that even though he thinks there's little chance of succeeding, he
doesn't care if he lives or dies, at least his son will get the money.
She promises him an extra five hundred pounds if they are successful.</P>
<P>He questions her reasons for coming here, surmising that she has an
ulterior motive. But she tells him that she is independently wealthy and
is only going because she loves her husband. The film is grandiose and
colorfully shot, seeming much like a travelog. When it dwells on the
trek's hardships, fighting the oppressive heat, the centipedes, snakes
and various bugs they are bothered by, the dangerous animals attacking
them, a stampede of various beasts including zebras and giraffes they
have to take cover from, and the many obstacles the rescuers come across
in the jungle, the film is simply a beautiful spectacle to behold. The
story bogs down when it becomes too much about the dependable
Quartermaine and the fetching redhead Elizabeth, going through a
love/hate relationship, where they eventually give way to there
predictable feelings of love, and Elizabeth confesses to her brother
that she never loved her husband and has come looking for him because of
the guilt she has, knowing that he left her for the diamond mine because
she treated him unkindly.</P>
<P>The story picks up renewed life when a lone 7- foot, taciturn Watusi
tribesmen (Siriaque) asks to join the group and it turns out that he is
a king returning to his native land to reclaim the kingdom from a
usurper. Before entering hostile territory, the bearers desert the
safari, stealing most of the supplies. The only remaining natives are
the loyal Khiva (Kimursi) and the purposeful Siriaque.</P>
<P>The group enters a hostile village, where there is a white man (Hugo
Haas) who gives them a false name. It turns out that Quartermaine
recognizes him as a murderer wanted by the police and figures he plans
to have the natives cannibalize them. By getting the drop on him, they
escape the hostile village, but not before they lose Khiva.</P>
<P>After much hardship, they come to the land where the diamond mine is and
where the king has come to reclaim his throne. The bad king will take
them to the mine and there they will see the bones of Henry. But they
are trapped in the mine and have to figure a way out to survive. When
they do get out, they watch as the two kings fight to see who will be
the legitimate king. The original film had a more ironical and less
standard ending than this version. But this is a highly appetizing film
and a more attractive one to view. Granger gives a commanding macho
performance and the vistas are delightfully magnicent, which should be
enough of a reason for seeing this version, also.</P>
