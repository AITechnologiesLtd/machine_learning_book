<PRE>                               GRIDLOCK'D
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>You could have fooled me.  Not being a fan of either most rock or rap
music, I was bowled over by the tragi-comedy that is GRIDLOCK'd.  I
laughed at the absurdities I heard coming from Spoon (Tupac Shakur) and
Stretch (Tim Roth).    They were saying very funny things but all
contained more than just a bit of the truth. "Life,"  sang Cookie
(ThandieNewton) "is a traffic jam, " and it certainly held true for
those three members of a nightclub band.</P>
<P>The first time I saw Thandie Newton was in the beautiful 1992
Australian coming-of-age film, FLIRTING, where she was a lovely
teenaged innocent in love with a white boy.    Adorable.  Here, in
GRIDLOCK'd, she is a spaced-out junkie. Thandie is utterly believable.</P>
<P>Tim Roth is a fine, versatile actor, his latest film being Woody
Allen's EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU.   In GRIDLOCK'd, he has a
terrifically funny scene with a couple of policemen whom he latches
onto because there are a couple of drug dealers who are nearby and who
would like to kill him.  "How do you become a policeman?" his
spaced-out character asks one of the baffled cops.  "I've always wanted
to be a policeman," he says with his stupid grin.</P>
<P>Sadly, Tupac Shakur was only 25 when he was killed only a few months
ago.  Watching his antiocs on the screen, seeing the goodness in the
man come through, one could not help but see the irony in his death.</P>
<P>In this film, he is the more sensible of the Stretch-Spoon duo, always
rescuing his friend from the predicaments he keeps getting into. Their
color-blind friendship flows so naturally.</P>
<P>The story that carries the film is about trying to get into a hospital
when you do not have insurance; the bureaucracy, the indifference of
the employees to the plight of those who must come to them for help.
And all of it presented in a hilalrious, witty series of exchanges.
Hey, If *I* liked this film, you are going to love it!</P>
<P>Directed with a sure hand by Vondie Curtis Hall.</P>
