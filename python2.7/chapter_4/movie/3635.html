                     A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     Iceland's motion picture industry may be in its infancy, but 
Fridrik Fridriksson's MOVIE DAYS is a very mature effort.  The director, 
who admits that this film is completely autobiographical, said he made 
the picture to honor his childhood influences and share his impressions 
on the variety of storytelling methods which led to his becoming 
involved in film making.  Elements of CINEMA PARADISO and Woody Allen's 
RADIO DAYS can be seen here, but Fridriksson pays homage; he does not 
steal.  The playful, occasionally-dreamy tone of MOVIE DAYS is all his 
own. </P>
<P>     Fridriksson loves movies -- that much is clear from the opening 
moments of this film when he shows his young protagonist, Tomas, staring 
enraptured at a showing of the American Biblical saga KING OF KINGS.  
There are other forms of entertainment in 1964 Iceland, most notably 
radio and television, but Tomas loves the cinema, whether the offering 
is a grand epic or a Roy Rogers flick.  His cousin is a Hollywood 
starlet who gets parts in such unmemorable titles as HITLER'S LAST DAYS 
and THE CRAWLING HAND (Fridriksson went out of his way to dig up scenes 
from these B-movies).  </P>
<P>     In addition to being a fond reminiscence, MOVIE DAYS is also an 
examination of how American pop culture -- including movies, TV, and 
music -- wormed its way into the fabric of Iceland's society.  
Regardless of how unappreciated U.S. global politics might have been, 
some elements of everyday American life were too seductive for their 
influence to be denied or rebuffed.  </P>
<P>     While the first half of this film is about how movies impact Tomas' 
world, the second half tells how he survives when deprived not only of 
his local theater, but of all the "comforts of civilization".  His 
parents send him to spend a summer on the rural farmstead of an uncle.  
There, instead of sitting in the darkness staring at a screen filled 
with wondrous images, he is relegated to lying on his sleeping pallet 
listening to bedtime stories.  Nevertheless, Tomas comes to enjoy this 
vastly different life for both its simplicity and its sincerity. </P>
<P>     MOVIE DAYS does not have an American distributor, nor is it likely 
to get one.  Although he's the best-known director in his country, 
Fridriksson is not recognized outside Iceland, which is a shame.  His 
pictures mix unaffected beauty with freshness and honesty.  And what 
about the image of Scandinavian films as slow-moving and deeply-
thoughtful?  In Fridriksson's own words, "[Ingmar] Bergman is boring."  
This should say just about all that's necessary about the pacing of 
MOVIE DAYS.   </P>
