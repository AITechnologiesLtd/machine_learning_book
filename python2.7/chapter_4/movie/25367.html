THE PAPER
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>In today's world of journalism, dominated by television,
Internet and "news as entertainment" business philosophy,
printed newspapers are considered to be the thing of the
past. Same thing happened to the perception of journalists
as fearless crusaders for truth and justice in this cynical
age. As a result, once thriving subgenre of journalism
movies almost disappeared from Hollywood. THE PAPER, 1994
drama by Ron Howard, represents one of those precious films
that deal with realities of life of modern newspaper
reporters.</P>
<P>The screenplay of THE PAPER, written by brother David and
Stephen Koepp, follows 24 hours in lives of reporters and
editors in "New York Sun" tabloid newspaper. The nominal
protagonist of the film is Henry Hackett (played by Michael
Keaton), workaholic editor who loves his job. But long
hours, low pay and uncertain future of the tabloid lead him
to think about new career. His pregnant wife Martha (played
by Marisa Tomei) urges him to think about better-paid but
more boring job in respectable "New York Sentinel"
newspaper. In the meantime, rapidly developing story about
two black teenagers being arrested for racially motivated
murders would represent another opportunity for Hackett to
use his skills of investigative reporter. Results of his
investigation, on the other hand, would later lead to
dramatic confrontations with bullish managing editor Alicia
Clark (played by Glenn Close).</P>
<P>Judging by some of American newspaper movie reviews, Koepp
brothers in their screenplay managed to paint rather
convincing picture of the life in modern editorial offices.
According to medical statistics in many countries, news
reporters and editors have shorter average lifespan than
those belonging to other professions and THE PAPER explains
the causes of this phenomenon - deadline, editorial
pressures and consequent stress that leads to chain-smoking
and alcoholism, and, naturally, all that has devastating
effects on reporters' personal lives. Ron Howard is faithful
to this gritty picture laced with black humour, but he
nevertheless adds some Hollywood touch with few moralising
scenes and melodramatic finale that went over the top with
some of the cliches (including notorious "Stop the presses!"
line). However, THE PAPER compensates these flaws with truly
great ensemble cast that relies more on character actors
like Keaton, Tomei, Close, Robert Duvall and Randy Quaid
Tomei than standard Hollywood stars. Because of them,
realistic atmosphere of modern-day editorial offices isn't
lost. THE PAPER, therefore, is a film that should be
recommended as skillfully done example of almost forgotten
dramatic subgenre.</P>
