The World Is Not Enough (8/10)</PRE>
<P>The World Is Not Enough is a James Bond film. The rest of this review is
optional reading, since you now know all you need to.</P>
<P>The film, the third in the series to star Pierce Brosnan as 007, is the
familiar mix of outrageous globe-trotting action, eye-popping gadgets
and unfeasibly beautiful girls. The plot is hardly worth mentioning
since you've seen it 18 times before, the traditional lunatic villain
played this time by Robert Carlyle. The whole thing is utterly barmy,
but if we accept that the best the Bond series can offer is a silly but
stylish romp, then James Bond XIX succeeds as well as any of its
predecessors. </P>
<P>We know what to expect from a Bond film, and the production team has to
balance the need to deliver the goods against the danger of the formula
becoming stale. There never was a time when the Bond films were
realistic - they have always taken place in a world constructed in the
fantasies of teenage boys, so the film-makers also have to preserve
Bond's timeless quality yet make the film relevant to a modern audience.
The team behind this Bond have got it just about right. Director Michael
Apted is better known for his documentaries and character-based films
such as 'Nell' and 'Gorillas In the Mist', and he handles this change of
pace well, although much of the credit should probably go to editor Jim
Clark and second unit director Vic Armstrong.</P>
<P>Pierce Brosnan is at least the second-best Bond there's been, but it's
probably sacrilege to even suggest he might be better than you-know-who.
He brings a cool, suave viciousness back to the role that went out of
fashion for a decade or two but can work again in our ironic post-
feminist post-modernist post-everything world.</P>
<P>There are three main female characters. We are meant to believe that
Christmas Jones (Denise Richards) is a physicist helping to dismantle
nuclear weapons in the wastes of a former Soviet republic, but our
credulity is severely tested by her jaw-dropping Lara Croft costume
which barely contains her jaw-dropping Lara Croft figure. Given the
concentration demanded of the work she and her male colleagues are
carrying out, her T-shirt would surely have been banned on grounds of
safety. Pleasing on the eye though Dr. Jones is, she is a depressing
throwback to the Bond bimbos of the past, and like the character she
plays, Denise Richards is pretty but pretty useless. Thank goodness for
Elektra King (Sophie Marceau), a much better-drawn and more complex
female character than those 007 usually encounters. The other leading
lady, and the classiest of the lot, is the wonderful Judi Dench, who in
her third outing as M gets more involved in the action that the
character ever has before.</P>
<P>Despite its lapses into some unfortunate features of Bondage past, The
World Is Not Enough confirms that the dismal days of the later Roger
Moore films are now just a bad memory, and the franchise that once
seemed culturally if not financially bankrupt is once again in good
shape. But then again, it is just a Bond film.</P>
