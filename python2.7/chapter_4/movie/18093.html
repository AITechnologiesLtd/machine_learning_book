<P>AMERICAN HISTORY X (M).  
(New Line Cinema/Village Roadshow)
Director: Tony Kaye
Stars: Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, Beverly D'Angelo, Fairuza Balk, 
Avery Brooks, Elliott Gould, Stacy Keach
Running time: 119 minutes.</P>
<P>Written by David McKenna, American History X explores the
origins of hatred and bigotry, and shows how those attitudes can be
passed from one generation to the next.  The film shows how
frustrated, insecure and impressionable youth are seduced by poisonous
ideologies.  This is an environment in which violence begets violence,
and history repeats itself with tragic consequences.  Derek Vinyard
(Edward Norton) is a vicious white supremist who kills three black
youths as they attempt to break into his car.  After three years in
prison he emerges a changed man.  His experiences have taught him
tolerance, and he no longer believes in the vile and spurious messages
spouted by his mentor (Stacy Keach).</P>
<P>Derek tries to heal the rift within his own family caused by
his violent and intolerant actions.  He also tries to steer his
impressionable younger brother Danny (T2's Edward Furlong) away from
following a similar path to self-destruction.  Danny worships Derek,
and, in his absence, has fallen under the spell of the same creed of
hatred and intolerance.</P>
<P>British director Tony Kaye makes a solid debut with this
powerfully disturbing and controversial portrait of racial hatred and
the rising tide of fascism in contemporary America.  The odious
rhetoric, and some of the characters and scenes, may remind audiences
of the repellent Romper Stomper.  However, unlike that film, American
History X manages to temper its extreme images with a more optimistic
message.  Given recent events in both England and America, American
History X's ending has an immediacy that makes its cautionary message
even more relevant.</P>
<P>Kaye also doubled as cinematographer, and he captures some
powerful images.  The extended flashback sequences are filmed in black
and white, which somehow gives them added power.  One flashback to the
crucial murders contains one of the most brutal scenes I've seen in
any recent movie.  Norton apparently had disagreements with Kaye over
the direction of the film and reshot portions of it himself.</P>
<P>The pair of dynamic central performances will mesmerise
audiences as well as leave them shaken.  With his short cropped hair
and a swastika tattooed on his chest, Derek cuts a frightening figure.
Norton delivers a blistering, volatile, and intelligent performance
that explores his contradictions, and builds upon his superb credits
in Primal Fear and The People Vs Larry Flynt.  Furlong continues to
impress with a solid performance that captures Danny's vulnerability
and gives the character some unexpected depths.  Keach is a nasty
piece of work as the sinister, self-appointed head of a white
supremist organisation.</P>
<P>This powerful and often confronting film presents a
frightening and genuinely disturbing view of society.  Its gut
wrenching message and impact here are every bit as effective as films
like Boyz N The Hood.  This is an important film that demands to be
seen.</P>
