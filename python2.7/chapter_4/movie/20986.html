<P>   Westerns--or at least the conventional type involving
stagecoach robberies--have been passe for quite a while
now.  Originally the domain of young, westerns were
accorded adult status when Gary Cooper's stirring role in
"High Noon" showed the advantages of presenting a well-
developed character in a genuinely tense and uncontrived
situation.  A film like "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"
could always break through the passing of fashion, but
remember that George Roy's masterwork featured the
extraordinary star power of Paul Newman and Robert
Redford, whose chemistry together was of a quintessence
and because "Butch Cassidy" was not really a western but a
serious character study sharpened by edgy dialogue which
masqueraded as a cowboy movie.  And oh what a song by
Burt Bacharach!</P>
<P>   Now Jake Scott, son of Ridley Scott and nephew of Tony
Scott, moves to bring the westerns back and targets the
youth audience in much the way of the horse operas of the
forties and early fifties.  There may be a coincidence here,
but we cannot help thinking that he is following in the
footsteps of his role models in styling the movie.  Ridley, for
example, began as a set designer and moved into his own
production company, manufacturing razzle-dazzle TV
commercials.  Kid brother Tony followed a similar path,
directing commercials before turning out his best-known hit,
"Top Gun," an empty action movie with the look of a TV
commercial--though he later turned on a youthful arthouse
crowd with "True Romance."</P>
<P>   Jake, like the two other directors in his family, puts grace
and elan only into his design and costumes rather than into
his plot, making "Plunkett & Macleane" a potential contender
for the production design Oscar.  His England of the mid-18th
Century is part Dickens, part Merchant-Ivory, one which
throws the rabble into high contrast with the bloated
aristocrats of the time.  Unfortunately for the film, the
script--written by a committee of five with three getting the
credit for this muddled writing--tells us virtually nothing about
the ragged background of its title characters and presents the
blue bloods as absurd, unbelievable caricatures.  With the
aristos portrayed in a campy manner and the highwaymen
presented as seriously noble lowlifes (one with pretensions to
the gentry), we don't know what to make of the array of
personalities.  Their juxtaposition just doesn't add up.</P>
<P>   James Maclaine and Will Plunkett were real characters,
interesting enough to have their careers and backgrounds re-
created on the screen rather than bowdlerized and made
contemporary with MTV editing, loud contemporary music,
and an absurd ending that would have rung true had the
scripters instead followed the actual bios of the men.  The
screenplay would have done better dramatize James
Maclaine's background in Ireland, refusal to sit at a desk with
the business his father left to him, and his trip to England
where he failed as a businessman.  After meeting a failed
pharmacist, Will Plunkett, the two took to robbing individuals
and coaches, showing personal differences in make-up. 
Maclaine did not have the heart for the criminal action while
Plunkett plunged into the underground career with passion.</P>
<P>   In the film, however, a less arresting difference in
temperament is played up.  Scott presents Macleane (Jonny
Lee Miller) as a man determined to rise in class into high
society while Plunkett (Robert Carlyle) maintains a contempt
for the aristos, retains his raggedly threads, and plays the
servant to his partner.   </P>
<P>   Cashing in on the affection of the young for vulgarity, Scott
has Macleane meet Robert under offensive conditions as the
more earthy Plunkett acts in jail to extricate the ruby he has
swallowed to avoid detection by the police.  They form a two-
man squad and, as eager as Willie Sutton to go where the
money is, they devise a scheme whereby Macleane would
dress in the Armani outfits of the day while Plunkett would
keep his Dickensian clothing and act as footman.  As they
move on to robbing and blasting stagecoaches--with Scott
throwing in the finest special effects that look at all authentic
with the firepower available in 1749--Macleane falls in love
with the feisty, unconventional Lady Rebecca (Liv Tyler), who
does not fit in with the rest of society, who is turned on by
stagecoach robberies.  Guessing the identity of the two men,
she urges them on to one final bit of larceny--against her own
coach.</P>
<P>   Ken Stott turns in a winning role as the most evil of villains,
a kind of police chief named Chance who operates in an
almost anarchic England, where people got hanged for
pickpocketing and where Chance and Lord Chief Justice
Gibson (Michael Gambon) are put under increasing pressure
by the prime minister to bring the two highwaymen to justice.  
Alan Cumming steals his scenes, as expected, playing the
bi-sexual--actually by his own admission one who "swings
every way"--who seems to have pierced eyebrows and who
operates in his country apparently before the anti-homosexual
laws that put Oscar Wilde in prison.  While Robert Carlyle
thankfully does not talk in Scottish and though Jonny Lee
Miller has matinee-idol good looks, they are no Robert
Redford and Paul Newman, their star power insufficient to
save a film that substitutes one-liners for wit and humor, rock-
video editing for continuity and silliness for romance.</P>
