<PRE>Getting in touch with the inner child
The Kid</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>A single prop, fire engine red biplane dive-bombs into the life of Russell
Duritz (Bruce Willis). He's a high powered, self-confidant, expensive suit
wearing, image consultant for the stars and politicians; but he's a jerk. At
least that's what his assistant, Amy, thinks of him (when she's not falling
in love with him). "We can't go around anymore talking about what we're
going to be like when we grow up - we are up!"</P>
<P>On the outside, he's completely smooth, rock solid and successful, but his
inner child is so abused, we'll lets just say a real lively taste of his
childhood drops by for a visit. "I don't have time to go crazy. If you want
me to go crazy you'll just have to get on the phone with Janet and schedule
an appointment!"</P>
<P>It's a wonderful premise, charming, magical, endearing -- Bruce and "the
Kid" are equally so; but there are a few tweaks left untweaked - mostly in
conducting. A film is like a symphony - it's intensity and dynamics need to
be carefully controlled. Appropriately held back after the first act, this
film longed to rock and roll in the third, but it didn't quite bust out.
This could have been remedied by reducing the length of the segment where
Bruce and kid are trying to figure out what to do with each other, make a
quicker run to the climax - beefing up the peak, then extending the
resolution to include family relationships etc.</P>
<P>The film never quite sold the fact that Bruce was a jerk/loser in need of a
supernatural visitation. In fact, I found his cut-to-the-chase, brutally
honest personality quite refreshing. Yes, he was no saint, but neither the
Scrooge character we'd expect to be crying for inexplicable intervention.</P>
<P>Even with this error, the film is still delightful. It's clean, polished,
seeded well with juicy funny lines and solid talent. Lily Tomlin is smashing
as Bruce's eye-rolling secretary. I enjoyed the red paint motif and slick
opening sequence. A very strong B+, but it's more of an adult movie which
kids might like, than visa versa.</P>
