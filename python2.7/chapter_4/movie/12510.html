<PRE>CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF
United States 1958
Directed by Richard Brooks</PRE>
<P>Cast: Paul Newman, Elizabeth Taylor, Burl Ives, Jack Carson</P>
<P>Paul Newman was one of best actors of the 1950s.
Elizath Taylor was one of the best actresses during
the 1950s. So what can you expect from a film from
this decade where they both appear? No disappointments,
they both give their best here.</P>
<P>There's also something very appealing with the way
how the works of Tennessee Williams has turned out
on the big scren. The Glass Menagerie, A Streetcar
Named Desire, Baby Doll, Sweet Bird of Youth and
Night of the Iguana have all become good movies.</P>
<P>The most memorable performance is by Burl Ives
as dying Big Daddy himself. Surprisingly, Ives
was not even 50 years old but looks as old as 70.
He plays the big, blunt hardworking plantation-
owner who has worked all his life to get some-
where. But despited that he has only contempt
for his wife Ida, for his well-behaving son
Gooper and Gooper's fertile wife. His other son,
Brick, is an ex-football star who has turned to
drinking. The future is not all bad, since Dr.
Baugh's examination has shown that Big Daddy's
cancer is not terminal.</P>
<P>The controversy takes place between Maggie and
Brick on the one hand and Gooper and his wife Mae
on the other. Mae use her children (the 'no-neck
monsters' to use Maggie's words) to suck up Big
Daddy and to show him which couple is the most
suitable to inherit the plantation. But he can't
stand their cynical attention and interest in his
health. But Maggie too is eager to get her hands
on the plantation.</P>
<P>Brick, a drinker with a broken leg, has also contempt.
Most of all for his wife Maggie, but also for all the
greed the inheritants-to-be show, waiting for Big Daddy
to die. As it turns out, Dr. Baugh hasn't told them
the truth. The cancer is terminal after all.</P>
<P>Jack Carson seem to be an underestimated actor. He
appeared in a lot of comedies or musicals but after
having seen him both in this one and A Star is Born
I understand that he had dramatic talent that perhaps
wasn't always appreciated.</P>
<P>Five Academy Award Nominations include Best Actor (Newman),
Best Actress (Taylor), Best Adapted Screenplay, Best
Cinematography and Best Director.</P>
