<PRE>AMERICAN PIE
USA, 1999
Directed by Paul Weitz
Written by Adam Herz</PRE>
<P>Well, I did know better, but I was curious, went anyway and I got what I
deserved -- the reaffirmation that I'm not eighteen any more.</P>
<P>For adults, while there are funny moments in this film about four high
school guys who vow to end their virginity before their impending
graduation in three weeks, overall the jokes and dialog are not sharp or
clever enough and the movie just rates an OK.</P>
<P>But this isn't a movie for adults.  It's a comedy for teenagers and as
such, it's a good one.  Teens can see and identify with their real
non-idealized selves up there on the screen and will find the
over-obvious, gross, embarrassing and sexual humor to be hilarious.  The
dialog is dumb, but realistic, since real teens aren't exactly fountains
of wit.  And contrary to most teen films, the six male characters don't
break down into simplistic good and bad guys -- they're all pretty much
clueless dweebs (which certainly echoes my high school experience) and
the worst ones are jerks, but those can still be part of your social
circle.</P>
<P>The film's R rating is one of those ironies that occurs frequently in
the American censorship system -- it makes it difficult for a large
portion of the film's target audience to actually see the film.  (It's
not exactly a film you'd enjoy watching with your Mom.)  Perhaps it will
reach its intended audience on video.</P>
<P>One scene that adults *can* totally enjoy is when Alyson Hannigan
(Willow from the TV series BUFFY, THE VAMPIRE SLAYER), who plays a
mousy, motormouth band dweeb constantly telling boring stories about
band camp, suddenly does a 180-degree turn and says to her prom date
"And then there was the time I stuck a flute in my pussy."  As her date
spurts out his beer, she tells him that band camp is really more of a
sex ed camp.  Then she says something like "Are we going to fuck soon?
I'm getting bored."  In the bedroom, she reveals she chose him for the
prom simply because he was a Sure Thing.  Now dominantly aggressive,
riding on top of him, she yells "What's my name?" slaps him and shouts
"Say my name, bitch!"</P>
<P>Another good one is when one girl is quizzing another about her lack of
orgasmic experience and says "Not even a manually-assisted one?  You
mean you've never double-clicked your mouse?"</P>
<P>Highly recommended for teenagers (particularly males).
Worth a video rental for adult Willow fans.
May or may not be worth a video rental for other adults.</P>
