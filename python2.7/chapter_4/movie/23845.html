<P>There is no other female star as watchable as Julia Roberts - no matter what
film she is in, she is indeed the sparkling star whom can't take our eyes off.
She sometimes makes good films ("Notting Hill," "My Best Friend's Wedding") and
rotten films ("Runaway Bride," "Sleeping With the Enemy"). Count her latest
"Erin Brockovich" as one of her best, a conventional but unquestionably
spirited and entertaining romp showcasing Julia's qualities to full flowering
effect. She burns on screen with such radiance, beauty and toughness that the
film will leave you beaming in phosphorescent delight.</P>
<P>Julia stars as Erin Brockovich, a real-life crusader who went against all odds
and came back as a winner of justice. At the beginning of the film, Erin is
desperately trying to get a job and uses her persuasive, feminine skills to get
one (she fakes resumes to obtain interviews). She fails, ends up in a car
accident, and gets a lawyer (Albert Finney) who fails to get her compensation
for her neck brace. Erin is so overwhelmed with anger that she confronts the
lawyer, Ed Masry, and convinces him to give her a job in his shabby L.A.
office. She is after all a divorced, single mom with starving kids, but her
attitude and flashy clothes, not to mention excessive cleavage, causes her
fellow employees to take notice. After sifting through a pro bono case
involving the company Pacific Gas & Electric in a nearby town named Hinkley,
Erin discovers that deposits of a lethal substance called chromium had been
placed in the water causing various tumors and other afflictions in the
townspeople. She investigates and questions the townsfolk, and before you know
it, she is knee deep in the water literally pulling a dead frog out as
evidence. </P>
<P>Erin's personal life has its ups and downs. She reluctantly has a babysitter
named George (Aaron Eckhart from "In the Company of Men"), a biker with
multiple tattoos, a bandana and a big grin, but he is also a very nice guy and
falls in love with Erin - the character is refreshingly cliche free of what we
expect to see from hardcore bikers. After a while, George becomes the caretaker
rather than the boyfriend since Erin is on her endless adventurous crusade
against PG&E. Will Erin realize that her work is less important than her
family, or will she fight to the bitter end and lose the multi-million dollar
court case? This may be the stuff of a Lifetime TV drama, and I only wish that
writer Susannah Grant devoted a little more attention to this inevitably
fractured relationship. There is an uneasy balance between Erin's case and her
home life, especially since George almost disappears from the story.</P>
<P>What makes "Erin Brockovich" special is Julia, and she cuts a dazzling figure
out of this character. She is tough, funny, sexy, charming, rude, obnoxious,
warm, caring, tender, flirtatious - my goodness, what a delight to see such a
real, intoxicating woman on screen for once! Julia disappears into the role so
well that we forget it is Julia, the movie star. For the first time in years,
Julia acts with tremendous, dramatic force. </P>
<P>Albert Finney is also pleasurably engaging as the haggard Masry, and his
double-take reactions to Erin's behavior and inappropriate language are
priceless. Another miraculous performance is by Marg Helgenberger as Mrs.
Jensen, one of the Hinkley townspeople afflicted with cancer - her porch scene
with Julia is as moving as one can expect. </P>
<P>Director Steven Soderbergh, known for nonlinear puzzles like "The Limey" and
"Schizopolis," effectively taps into Julia's high-wire act to keep things
afloat. If the screenplay took more chances with such a conventional storyline,
it might have been a more winning character study. As is, Soderbergh allows for
some occasional jump cuts during Erin's frantic moods, and a burnished glow to
the desert scenes in L.A. that makes one feel the heat and humidity. And Julia
creates an inspiring character - an uneducated, strong, honest woman who used
her brains and beauty to uncover corruption and to save people whom she cared
about. Inspiring indeed.</P>
