<P>Men and women are likely (and understandably) to be disturbed by the acidly
amusing and intoxicating "In the Company of Men,"  a new film about how
pernicious and hateful men are towards women, and men. The film is a devilish
surprise: a morbidly comical and terrifyingly real expose on what happens
between men and women in today's society.</P>
<P> Newcomer Aaron Eckhart (resembling a young Harrison Ford) stars as Chad, a
malignant office worker who continually shares his hateful views on other
workers and women to his bumbling colleague, Howard (Matt Malloy). Chad hates
everyone, hates his job and especially hates women. One night at a restaurant,
Chad proposes an idea to Howard: they will find an insecure, sweet woman whom
they will woo and then dump with a major thud. The idea is that they must be
complicit in their wounding an innocent woman, which leaves Howard unsure
whether to proceed with such a plan. Chad finds the right victim - a fragile,
deaf secretary named Christine (Stacy Edwards). Chad's only objective in this
game is to inflict emotional injury by only pretending to love Christine.
Howard, however, really starts to develop feelings for her, and feels that this
game is immoral. </P>
<P>There are many ways in which "In the Company of Men" makes us see how complex
this triad is. Chad is eminently lethal and hateful whereas Howard is more
caring and has some shred of humanity. The film doesn't make Christine a
complete saint, though, considering she dates both men simultaneously until
Chad tells her he really loves her. Essentially, Christine dumps Howard for
Chad. Then Howard becomes envious and feels he has to do something to prevent
this false union. But does Howard suddenly care because she's deaf, or because
he loves her? And is Chad really doing more damage to Howard than to Christine?</P>
<P>"In the Company of Men" is both darkly comic and scathingly serious in its
treatment of a curious subject - it is written by first-time writer-director
Neil LaBute, and at times, you won't know whether to laugh or cringe. A major
reason for this imbalance is the depiction of its characters who are acutely
performed by all three leads: Eckhart is brilliantly effective as the insulting
and obnoxious Chad; Matt Malloy makes Howard as pathetic and cumbersome as you
can imagine; and Stacy Edwards is a revelation as the flattered Christine
unaware of her doomed relationship with Chad; she projects sympathy and
heedfulness.</P>
<P> "In the Company of Men" is a film you're not likely to forget and shouldn't -
it is profound, shrewdly written and masterfully directed. LaBute composes this
world in bland, colorless ways such as the anonymous offices; the employees
dressed in white shirts; the dreary cafes, restaurants and rental cars; and
roofs that seem to offer no discernible view. What will stay with you, though,
is Chad's malice thereby evoking the most uncommon and complex behavioral
portrait of the year. </P>
