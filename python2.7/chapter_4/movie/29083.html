<P>PLOT:
A rich guy who doesn't believe in love, orders a mail-order bride for himself.
That very evening, the couple is married and fall madly in love soon thereafter.
But what's this? One of them might not be the person they are pretending to be?
Wow...a sin, indeed.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Easily one of the worst movies that I've seen all year. Too long, too boring,
too predictable and too ridiculous for anyone interested in watching a good
movie. What the hell were they thinking when they made this thing? (it's no
wonder that the film has been sitting on the racks for about a year) This felt
like a really bad TV movie of the week, with some nudity stuffed in from time to
time, just to wake up the audience. Have you ever switched channels and fallen
upon one of those ridiculously melodramatic TV movies, one that you just
couldn't help but switch back to from time to time, just to make sure that it
wasn't part of some sick joke? Well, this movie is exactly like that, only it
isn't a joke, it isn't on TV and you are asked to pay money to see it!! I say
again...what the shite were they thinking? Okay, so where do I start? First of
all, the trailer of this film gives away the movie's main plot twist, the
betrayal. So for the first half hour of the film, you're basically just sitting
there, watching these two "lovers" go through the motions until the "betrayal"
occurs. Whoopee, big surprise. Second of all, Angelina Jolie is horribly miscast
in this part. Why? Well, it's like this: not for one second do you ever believe
that she is not a nasty backstabbing woman! I mean, it's like all of those
people who complained about Jack Nicholson being psycho from the start of THE
SHINING, well, the same goes here. Every look in Jolie's eyes screams "psycho"!</P>
<P>Then of course, you have the case of the "patsy" husband, a man who just can't
seem to figure out anything in time. I mean...how boring is that for the
audience? You're watching this guy screw up time after time after time, and
somehow, we're supposed to feel sorry or care about this dude. No, thanks! And
if we don't care about him, and we really don't care about her (she's a beeyatch
and as confused as we are about her actual motivations in the film), who the
hell are we supposed to care about in this film? Well, I'll tell you. The only
thing that I was worrying about the whole way through this picture was whether
or not I'd actually fall asleep before the end credits rolled. No suspense, no
chemistry between the leads, no real love or passion, no sense of surprise,
plenty of plot holes for everyone and an extra moronic ending. So why am I even
giving this film a rating of three points? Well, it's actually pretty simple. I
liked the locations in the movie and the groovy score, but my primary reason for
slipping three notches onto this bedpost is for the gratuitous shots of Jolie's
boobies (that's two points right there!) and another one for Antonio's ass
(hairless, just for the record). Everything else in this movie was pointless,
boring and just plain stupid. Try imagining a soft-porn movie...but without the
plot! That's pretty much what you've got here. A low point in the careers of
both stars.</P>
<P>Oops, I almost forgot to mention the crappy dialogue...God oh mighty...make it
stop!!</P>
