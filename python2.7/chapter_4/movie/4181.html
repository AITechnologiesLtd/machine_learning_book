<PRE>                               CAFE AU LAIT
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     The young (26-year-old) French Mathieu Kassovitz, in his
directorial debut, has made a delightful comedy about two men in love
with the same woman and she with them.  Kassovitz also wrote the screen
play and dialogue.</P>
<P>     In the opening scene, we see Felix, who is a bike messenger, only
twenty years old, flying through Paris at top speed on his bike.  He is
on his way to the beautiful eighteen-year-old West Indian, Lola, who
has the beautiful skin color that matches cafe au lait.</P>
<P>     The other man in love with Lola is Jamal, also twenty, a Muslim.
He comes from a family of high ranking diplomats and has real class.</P>
<P>     When the two men arrive, Lola surprises them with a bit of news:
she is pregnant, is determined to have the baby but does not know which
of her two lovers is the father.  How the problems are resolved and how
well Kassovitz handles the movie makes up the film.</P>
<P>     Very entertaining.   In French with English subtitles.</P>
