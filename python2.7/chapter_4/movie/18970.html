<PRE>THE LOSS OF SEXUAL INNOCENCE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Writer and director Mike Figgis is best known for his award winning ode
to the joys of alcoholism and suicide, LEAVING LAS VEGAS.  This time
he's back with a semi-autobiographical movie called THE LOSS OF SEXUAL
INNOCENCE.</P>
<P>Most viewers, including this seasoned one, will be at a loss to say
precisely what the picture is about and what Figgis is trying to say
with it.  The story is bafflingly frustrating yet beautifully intriguing
and unabashedly sexual.  Think of it as a mysterious, erotic tone poem
for thinking adults.</P>
<P>But be forewarned.  Many members of the audience are likely to be
scratching their heads at the end, asking themselves, "What was that all
about?"</P>
<P>Told in overlaying stories that flash forward and back, the stories are
purposefully oblique.  Containing few audible words, the film's sparse
dialog is generally heard, if at all, in whispers or through obstacles
such as glass or fire.  Figgis wants the images and his sublime music to
carry the picture.</P>
<P>Nic, played as an adult with a forceful presence by Julian Sands, is the
central character.  We see his childhood at various ages in flashbacks.
One of these shows Nic as a significantly obese young teen.  Since Sands
is tall and athletic, this casting of the excessively plump boy was a
particularly bad choice.</P>
<P>Anther related story has to do with grown twins (Saffron Burrows) who
were separated at birth and who meet each other in an airport.  The best
part of this story is a long and absolutely adorable sequence of newly
born twins as they stretch and greet the world.</P>
<P>The third story is an unusual Adam (Femi Ogumbanjo) and Eve (Hanne
Klintoe) fable set in a Garden of Eden.  In a movie charged with
eroticism, these sequences are the most playfully sexual.  One scene has
Adam and Eve playing something akin to the kid's game of doctor as they
explore each other's bodies.  In a movie that clearly should have been
rated NC-17, they are shown in full frontal-nudity as they observe each
other standing and urinating.  This story contains the most nudity this
side of a porn flick.</P>
<P>The most controversial scene in the movie is the expulsion of Adam and
Eve from the Garden of Eden.  Using a loud and shrill version of
Beethoven's Ode to Joy, Figgis makes the purge take on a Naziesque feel
as the once innocent young lovers are chased by hidden boogiemen with
flashlights.</P>
<P>The various stories are interrelated in ways imaginable and
unimaginable.  The movie is best savored when you turn brain off and
treat the movie as a completely sensory experience.</P>
<P>The picture is at its most satisfying in its sexual escapades.  Besides
the aforementioned Biblical references, two other sexual scenes stand
out.</P>
<P>One, starring Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as the 18-year-old Nic, takes place
in the living room of Nic's date.  As they kiss and he tries without
much success to escalate the activities, they are ever on their guard,
lest they wake her father.  This funny and charming scene is one that
most of us have experienced before, and Figgis's staging is convincingly
natural.</P>
<P>Another erotic episode takes place in the kitchen after the grown Nic
and his wife have put their young boy to bed.  As she cuts carrots, he
begins to seduce her from behind.  We observe their lovemaking like
voyeurs through the kitchen window.  Again, Figgis's staging is dead-on,
and their passion has a visceral intensity.</P>
<P>Confusingly mesmerizing and handsomely filmed, the movie defies
deconstruction but speaks to you through its subliminal messages.  When
you leave, you're more likely to feel the movie in your subconscious
than to think about it directly.  Fight the urge to understand it.  Just
enjoy it.</P>
<P>THE LOSS OF SEXUAL INNOCENCE runs 1:41.  It is rated R for strong sexual
content, full-frontal nudity, violence and profanity.  Consider the
movie NC-17 and for adults.</P>
