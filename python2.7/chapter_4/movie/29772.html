<PRE>_Hardball_ (PG-13) * (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        If Biggie Smalls weren't dead already, certainly the sight and sound of
Keanu Reeves murdering his hit "Big Poppa" not once, but twice in _Hardball_
would have done the job.  For the rest of us, sitting through the schmaltzfest
that is _Hardball_ amounts to a two-hour torture session that would make one
long for the great beyond.</P>
<P>        Watching Reeves lord over a boys' baseball team in a
_Bad_News_Bears_-ish comedy is a horrifying enough prospect, but _Hardball_ is
even more galling than what the misleading ad campaign sells it as: it's a
teary, inspirational sports drama.  But despite having the same early fall berth
and also featuring a name star above its title, _Hardball_ is no
_Remember_the_Titans_, the truly uplifting and moving blockbuster that starred
Denzel Washington--for reasons that go far beyond the lopsided Keanu vs. Denzel
argument.</P>
<P>        First and foremost is the lead character of Conor O'Neill.  Reeves'
lackluster performance aside (more on that later), Conor, who begins the film as
a compulsive gambler deep in debt to loan sharks, is hardly an interesting or
appealing "hero."  In exchange for a weekly check, a businessman friend (Mike
McGlone) makes Conor coach an inner city little league team, the Kekambas.  The
usual would-be heartwarming hokum ensues: Conor learns that there's more to life
than sports bets; the kids are inspired to win by Conor.</P>
<P>        Or are they?  Conor does a lot of things with the Kekambas, but one of
them is certainly not coaching.  The most he is shown doing during practice
sessions is hitting balls to outfielders.  He never gives anyone any pointers
except that it's important to show up.  Duh.  As such the Kekambas' winning ways
are completely their own doing, with very little to no help from Conor.  It's
staggering how director Brian Robbins and screenwriter John Gatins adapted a
book (by Daniel Coyle) about little league coaching by completely erasing just
about all trace of the practice.</P>
<P>        So _Hardball_ becomes one of those films where the African-Americans
make life better for the white man with little to no return, and the balance is
thrown even further with one especially manipulative late-inning turn.  But
Robbins starts making mawkish far earlier than that; any occurrence that can
make the slightest tug at a heartstring, such as a player not getting a team
T-shirt, is accompanied by a maudlin score cue.  The young cast is instructed to
pout for maximum effect whenever not hammering home their characters' single
defining quality, e.g. one player has to wear headphones and listen to "Big
Poppa" while pitching (hence setting the stage for Reeves' rickety renditions);
one kid who is actually too young to play nonetheless listens to Conor's sage
advice by showing up for every game and practice.</P>
<P>        Reeves has turned in awful performances for top-notch directors such as
Francis Ford Coppola and Kenneth Branagh, so it's no shock that he doesn't do
any better for a hack like Robbins.  What is surprising is that Robbins appears
to have given Reeves complete free reign, for Conor is prone to Keanu-isms that
you see the star doing at awards shows and in interviews: the constant head
bobbing, the arm-waving.  Reeves is also still a block o' balsa when it comes
time to show emotion, whether during the sappiness of the final stretch or in
the afterthought of a romantic subplot between Conor and a schoolteacher (Diane
Lane, wasted again).
        Yet as tempting as it is to pin _Hardball_'s failure on Reeves, fault
must go to the shockingly untalented Robbins, who, after _Varsity_Blues_ and
_Ready_to_Rumble_, continues his streak of wretched sports-tinged movies.  It
figures that "Hardball"'s big lesson is about the importance of showing up, for
obviously the _Head_of_the_Class_ alum owes his directing career to being at the
right place at the right time.  Who the hell knows wherever and whenever that
may have been, but it's certainly a moment in time cursed by true film fans
everywhere.</P>
