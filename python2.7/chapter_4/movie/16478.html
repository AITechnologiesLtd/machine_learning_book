A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Terrence Malick</PRE>
<P>Written by: Terrence Malick, adapted from the James Jones novel</P>
<P>Starring: Jim Caviezel, Sean Penn, Elias Koteas, Nick Nolte</P>
<P>Synopsis:
In this nontraditional film an American World War II army company is
ordered to assault an important hill on Guadalcanal that is held by
desperate and starving Japanese soldiers manning machine gun nests at
the top of the hill. The movie jumps disjointedly from one soldier to
another in order to expose inner thoughts, fears, flashbacks, and
philosophies. Two of its main themes are that war is surreal and
accomplishes nothing, and that all men are really facets of the same
oneness that pervades nature and the universe.</P>
<P>Opinion:
Watching THE THIN RED LINE is a little bit like seeing a seeing a three
hour slide show and hearing a poetry reading. The cinematography is
extraordinary, and the thoughts are mystical and deep. However, don't
expect a traditional story line or resolution because the THIN RED LINE
is more of a film experience than a story. The whole idea is to portray
the mindlessness of war. The good die with the bad. Men enter and leave
and are replaced like machinery. Savagery exists side by side with
nature's beauty. Each person must make sense of it on their own.</P>
