<PRE>BOYS DON'T CRY
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2000 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Hilary Swank's breakthrough, Oscar=AE-winning performance as Teena
Brandon dominates "Boys Don't Cry," a harrowing, true-life tale about a
20-year-old Nebraskan native who chose to live her life as a boy until her
grisly end at the hands of her so-called friends.  Kimberly Peirce's film
is a difficult one to watch, a study of small-town ignorance and the
prejudice it breeds, with Swank truly remarkable as the self-destructive
youth who drifts from bar brawl to bar brawl before descending on the
depressed rural hamlet of Falls City.  With little more to do than lie,
cheat, and steal the days away, "Brandon" hooks up with a pickup-full of
beer-guzzling degenerates, one of whom (played by Chlo=EB Sevigny in an
Oscar=AE-nominated turn) he falls for.  Swank's distinction is not just her
ability to play a boy convincingly--her deep-set cheekbones and angular jaw
give Swank a discrete physical advantage--it's the emotional depth she
injects into the role of a juvenile struggling with a self-confessed sexual
identity crisis.  Sevigny, while not required to compete with Swank in the
complexity department, is nonetheless crucial as the na=EFve Lana, whose
unenlightened friends finally discover Brandon's true identity and, fueled
by alcohol, hate, and pathological fear, brutally rape and murder her.
Teena Brandon's downfall was not that she chose the wrong identity but that
she opted to hang out with the wrong group of people.  And in "Boys Don't
Cry," a film that rarely pulls its punches, Hilary Swank masterfully
realizes the emotionally disturbing ambiguities which governed that final,
fatal decision.</P>
