<P>Brian De Palma will never be a truly great director. He's had over 20
years to prove himself and while some of his films are fluidly filmed
and make for very interesting entertainment, the majority of his films
are mediocre at best.  De Palma likes to pay tribute to Alfred Hitchcock
every time he sets out to make a film and likes to throw in as many
macabre scenes as the script will allow.  De Palma's use of repetition
to make a point is often tedious and his use of slow motion is very
tiresome at times.  I loved 1987's 'The Untouchables' more for Sean
Connery's Oscar winning performance and David Mamet's tense and
classical script and while the baby carriage scene on the train station
stairs worked to perfection, De Palma should have quit while he was
ahead because he almost ruined the film by stretching out the rooftop
climax scene beyond belief.  How many times can you play a swelling
music score and zoom in slowly on someone's eyes?  1976's 'Carrie' is a
good film and has Oscar nominated performances from Sissy Spacek and
Piper Laurie but De Palma stretches out the scene at the prom after
Carrie is crowned prom queen just a bit too long before the famous
soaking in pig's blood.  De Palma ruined 1983's 'Scarface' by allowing
every second word in the film to be f***.  De Palma's masterpiece (a
term used loosely in his case) is 1980's 'Dressed to Kill'.  That film
had a truly eerie tone and genuine chills and despite some large plot
holes, 1981's 'Blow Out' is a pretty good runner-up to 'Dressed to
Kill'.</P>
<P>In 'Snake Eyes' Nicolas Cage is Rick Santoro, a mildly corrupt Atlantic
City police officer attending a much hyped boxing match which is being
filmed for television's pay per view format.  The U.S. secretary of
defence is in attendance at the fight and is guarded by standard secret
service protection and is accompanied by Major Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinese)
who also acts as a bodyguard.  Distracted at the fight by a beautiful
tart in a red dress, Sinese leaves his post and the secretary is shot
and later dies in the hospital.  The shooting causes pandemonium and the
14,000 people at the event are sealed in as the building is ordered
shut.  Central to the plot and a key player in the whole scenario is a
nearsighted young woman named Julia Costello (Carla Gugino) who tries to
flee the building after the assassination for a different reason than
everyone else.</P>
<P>'Snake Eyes', if anything, makes one important point.  In the age of
electronic media, a political assassination cannot be concealed in a
public place.  Someone is bound to pick it up.  No more public
executions like the conspiracy (don't write me back saying there wasn't
a conspiracy because I'll laugh in your face and you'll get a nasty
response) that killed JFK.  The perpetrators of that crime would be
caught today if they tried that in public, either on film or videotape.
I admire the film for that but De Palma's latest attempt at suspense is
disappointing because the solution to the film is revealed too early and
De Palma fails to find any sub text to make the second half as good as
the first.  The film falls apart after about 45 minutes and never picks
itself back up.</P>
<P>Also, at a running time of only 98 minutes, the film resolves itself too
quickly without a sense of academic depth.  I often complain that films
are too long but this one is too short.  This is the kind of film that
needs to be over two hours in length but only if the set and plot points
can be expanded and they are not.  'Snake Eyes' was filmed largely in
Montreal, Quebec, Canada and is set inside the boxing arena for 99% of
its running time.  Some necessary scenes were actually filmed in
Atlantic City, New Jersey and oddly enough, another film, 1981's
'Atlantic City' with Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon combined Montreal
and Atlantic City to tell its story in the famous U.S. city of the
famous boardwalk.</P>
<P>Nicolas Cage is excellent in 'Snake Eyes' and Gary Sinese is a good
character but a predictable one and doesn't take full advantage of the
darker sides in his character's personality.  The female characters are
a throw away as they often are in De Palma's films and if Brian De Palma
could use actors and story lines the same way he uses his camera, he
might have an Oscar or two in his collection but for all the right
reasons, De Palma has never even once been nominated for the Academy
Award but he has been nominated 5 times for the Razzie award for the
worst that the film industry has to offer.  His peers are as unforgiving
as his critics.</P>
