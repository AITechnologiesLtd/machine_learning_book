<PRE>MR. NICE GUY
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Mr. Nice Guy is the latest Jackie Chan film, so you should know what to
expect.  A weak plot, terrible dialogue, very little acting ability, but
some jaw-dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it
worthwhile. However, Mr. Nice Guy lacks the sparkle of Jackie's best
efforts, and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever.</P>
<P>Jackie Chan plays, who else, Jackie.  This time out, he's a famous chef
who hosts an Australian cooking show.  Not that it ever makes a
difference in the plot.  There are only two scenes of him cooking.  For
the rest of the film, somehow he mutates into Jackie Chan, Supercop.  It
never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts
skills...perhaps he was in the same cooking class as Steven Seagal in
Under Siege?</P>
<P>A TV newswoman, Diana (Gabrielle Fitzpatrick), covertly tapes a drug
deal involving kingpin Giancarlo (Richard Norton) and a local gang of
toughs, The Demons. Although she only has one camcorder, somehow the
result is full of close-ups and multiple angles...hmmm, shades of
Broadcast News???  Anyway, the goons discover Diana, and will do
anything to recover the tape. Here lies another crucial flaw in the
story:  doesn't anyone realize you can copy a tape?  Oh well, no one
ever said Jackie Chan movies had to make sense.</P>
<P>As luck would have it, Diana runs across Jackie, and, wouldn't you know
it, Jackie accidentally ends up with the tape.  This leads to countless
chase and/or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted
from Rumble in the Bronx or nearly any other Jackie Chan movie.</P>
<P>In a move apparently designed to woo American (and other
English-speaking) audiences, the film uses English as its primary
language.  However, that doesn't mean an end to the atrocious dubbing
that has afflicted Jackie's recent Americanized releases.  Strangely,
many of the characters speaking English are overdubbed with English, and
poorly too.  Whether this is just a very bad case of looping, an effort
to minimize accents, or a simple case of nostalgia, it does achieve the
same level of distraction present in all of Jackie's dubbed films.</P>
<P>The plot in Mr. Nice Guy is negligible, merely an excuse to have Jackie
on the run from various goons.  But even though plots have always been
second to the action in Jackie's films, it seems odd that the filmmakers
have stuck us with this tired retread. Look, if you have Jackie Chan
playing a chef, why not use that to your advantage?  Watching Jackie
doing his stuff in a kitchen, beating the bad guys with foodstuffs
sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts.</P>
<P>The action is a mixed bag here.  There's really only one no holds barred
fight scenes that have become the trademark of Jackie's films.  It takes
place in the arbitrary location of a construction site, apparently for
the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that
can be useful ala Jackie Chan.  The action in the film is neither
Jackie's best nor worst, but you long for some more inspiration in the
scenes.</P>
<P>The film's gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting.  Once or twice,
it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence.  But to
slo-mo Jackie running?  Either this is a nod to the Six-Million Dollar
Man, or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that Jackie may be
slowing down.</P>
<P>If you've seen all of Jackie's films and are in need of another fix, go
ahead and see Mr. Nice Guy.  However, if you're just in the mood for
some good action, you'd be better off hitting the video store for some
of his better work, such as Supercop.</P>
