<PRE>                               THE FIVE SENSES
                        A film review by Jeremiah Kipp

<P>Not to be confused with that Bruce Willis ghost story, The Five Senses
is more along the lines of Kieslowski Lite.  The lives of five Canadians
are connected by the sensations of touch, taste, smell, sound, and
sight.  They all reside in the same apartment complex, not unlike the
lost souls wandering through The Decalogue.  Each of the protagonists
are faced with a glib moral crisis which must be resolved during the
seemingly endless hour-and-forty-five-minute running time.</P>
<P>Ruth, a professional massage therapist (Gabrielle Rose, The Sweet
Hereafter), uses the sensation of touch -- get it? -- to heal a wounded
relationship with her daughter's former teacher (Molly Parker, who saw,
smelled, tasted, and touched dead people in Kissed).</P>
<P>Sexy young socialite Rona (Mary-Louise Parker, Fried Green Tomatoes) is
able to communicate with her hot Italian lover (Marco Leonardi), who
can't speak a word of English, through the magic of delicious food and,
of course, some really great sex.  You can cross taste off of your
mental checklist, folks.</P>
<P>On and on we go.  There's the Crimes and Misdemeanors bit with the
sensitive young eye doctor (Philippe Volter, The Double Life of
Veronique) who is going deaf.  Not blind.  Deaf.  Cue the orchestra.  I
can already hear fifty violins crying out to God.  That covers both
sight and sound, doesn't it?</P>
<P>Most ridiculous is the story of a happy-go-lucky bisexual house cleaner
(Daniel MacIvor) who, undergoing a crisis of love, sets up a series of
dates where he proceeds to smell his former romantic partners. 
Ooo-la-la!</P>
<P>Throw in a subplot about a missing child, and you've got some serious
drama.</P>
<P>Writer-director Jeremy Podeswa approaches his story with solemnity which
errs on the side of pretentiousness.  The heavy-handed themes are so
broad and predictable that The Five Senses induces laughs in all the
wrong places.</P>
<P>The clean, austere shots are more revelatory in showing how disconnected
and empty these lives are, but that Canadian sense of detachment is
familiar from Atom Egoyan's stronger portraits of loneliness.  Exotica
comes immediately to mind, but the difference between Podeswa and Egoyan
is that The Five Senses isn't about character or even emotion, but about
ideas.  That's a mistake when you're crafting a movie about human
interaction -- no amount of egghead theory will make you care a fig
about whether or not the housecleaner will find true love.</P>
<P>Mary-Louise Parker brings a clever sensuality to her role, whether
flirting with Leonardi or grousing about her lousy lot to MacIvor.  She
surpasses the Generation-X "Am I after love or just sex?" dialogue by
making her character decidedly feral and bitchy.  You wouldn't want to
date this vixen past a one-night stand, but she makes for a lively
character in an otherwise ponderous piece of art house snobbery.</P>
