<PRE>                            FALLING FIRE 1996
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Directed by Daniel D'Or
Cast Michael Paré, Heidi von Palleske, Mackenzie Gray, Zerha Leverman,
Cedric Turner, Christian Vidosa
Written by Daniel D'Or, Peter I. Horton, Philip Jackson</P>
<P>There seems to be a revived interest surrounding falling meteorites and
the destruction of our beloved home planet Earth. It has been suggested
that these comets with pretty tails, were most likely caused the
extinction of the dinosaurs not too long ago. In the coming event of
METEOR another big, Hollywood disaster, action flick, there was first
FALLING FIRE, starring Michael Pare - an underrated C Grade action
prince.</P>
<P>This movie begins by explaining how all of earth's natural mineral
resources have been depleted by the demands of overpopulation. The
Earth's solution to this problem is not family planning, but rather
pulling a meteorite out of its trajectory and into earth's orbit for
mining. Anyone in their right minds will now that this is just asking
for unwanted trouble. But alas an intensely dangerous situation must be
created for Pare to display his fighting skills. To be fair, some credit
must be given to Pare for giving his character an element of depth, when
arguing in the ‘problem with wife scene', and for showing some emotion
in the ‘air born sex scene'.</P>
<P>To make the plot more simple than it already is, add a saboteur aboard
the space station, throw in a religious fanatic groups out to destroy
earth, include elements of murder/mystery, with Pare trying to act and
you'll have a unbelievably great time at the C Grade Pics.</P>
