<PRE>                                  TO LIVE
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ****</PRE>
<P>     TO LIVE is an incredible story of life in Communist China from the
beginnings of Mao's revolutionary victory through the Great Leap
Forward and the Cultural Revolution and ending with ascendancy of the
Red Guard.  It is all told with the story of a single working class
family with the husband played by Ge You and the wife by Gong Li.</P>
<P>     The movie is divided by decades.  Each of the three decades (40s,
50s, and 60s) in turn covers only a small time slice of the decade so
that in the end you feel like the husband and wife are old friends that
you have known for a long time and that, moreover, you know them
extremely well.  The script's layout and the brilliant writing make
this possible.</P>
<P>     We start with the husband as an idle landowner who ignores his
wife and who wastes his life and his fortunes in the gambling dens that
were popular just before the Communist takeover.  His only passion and
the only talent he has is his hobby of singing during shadow puppet
performances.  Soon, however, he is swept into the throws of the
revolution.  Throughout the show his puppet singing provides both a
metaphor for the spirit of each decade and his constant solace.</P>
<P>     I have never seen a more anti-Communist movie.  The horrors of
this ideology were everywhere.  When they are ordered to give up all of
their cooking utensils in order that the entire village could make the
equivalent of three cannon balls, the people are told not to worry
because Communism will provide for them.</P>
<P>     In another example of the horrors of the time, the Red Guard takes
over the hospital and throws out all of the doctors and nurses since
they are old and counter-revolutionary.  In their place, they have
young students attempt to guess at what to do for sick people.  Suffice
it to say that it did not work.</P>
<P>     In every decade, as their standard of living gets worse, they
still believe that it will be good someday.  It was not a very safe
time to be alive either.  If you were of working class stock, if you
managed never to get to be a party official, and if you laid low and
agreed to do whatever the party said and hate whomever the party said
to hate including your (ex-)friends, then and only then did you stand
much chance of survival.</P>
<P>     The movie, however, uses the backdrop of Communism more as a way
to explain the harsh living conditions of the family.  This show is
about family love more than anything else.  If your family could
survive this and be not only in tact, but happy, then it is a strong
family indeed!</P>
<P>     There are a couple of devastatingly awful tragedies that strike
this family.  It is easy to cry they are so terrible, and yet the film
is never manipulative.  I am glad the horrors were shown since it made
their ability to smile at adversity seem even more amazing.</P>
<P>     I know it will never happen, but Ge You deserves an academy
nomination and maybe the award as well.  To say his performance was
moving is a gigantic understatement.  Although Gong Li was not quite as
good, hers was an outstanding performance.  The movie is so real that
you had to pinch yourself to remember it was not a documentary.</P>
<P>     If you liked The Joy Luck Club, then you should love this since it
is an order of magnitude better made and more realistic.  TO LIVE was
one of the most life affirming movies of the year.</P>
<P>     TO LIVE is in Mandarin with easy to follow English subtitles.  It
runs 2:13 which is just about perfect although it was good enough to
make it a 6 hour movie in my opinion.  I recommend everyone over the
age of about 10 see it.  It is unrated, but I suspect it would be rated
PG-13 for some scenes of violence.  There is no sex, nudity, or bad
language.  I give it my top rating of ****.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
