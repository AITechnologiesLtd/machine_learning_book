<P>   You hear it all the time from disgruntled patrons of
Broadway's musical theater.  "What's with the stage these
days?" they complain. "You leave a show and you don't have
a single song that you can hum."  While I've rarely seen
people actually "humming" when they left their seats during
the golden age of the American musical, the modern
complaints have some merit.  Fans of Stephen Sondheim
may say with their noses in the air that the absence of
melody nowadays is a plus--that easy-to-mimic tunes are not
only dated but simple-minded--but this rejoiner comes across
as sour grapes.  Truth to tell, there was only one
Renaissance in the history of the West, Spain had its one
golden age, Athens was once the center of civilization but is
certainly not that now, and the great era that gave us Cole
Porter, the Gershwins, Irving Berlin, Lerner and Loewe,
Rodgers and Hammerstein and the like is over.  Kaput.</P>
<P>   We welcome revivals of the relative handful of great
musicals with open arms. This time the nationally famous art-
house, New York's Film Forum, is the scene of a rekindling of
"Kiss Me Kate," which plays there from July 7 through July
20.  Though the glasses you'll get at the box office may give
you a headache (especially if your nose already bears a pair
of its own), the Film Forum is tossing out this musical version
of "The Taming of the Shrew" in remarkable 3-D.  People of a
certain age like me can pretend that after the movie they can
resume rooting for the Brooklyn Dodgers, playing stoop ball
and marbles, while the young 'uns can be introduced to a
technology that was the hottest thing in its day ("House of
Wax," "Bwana Devil") but like Internet stocks seems to have
wound up on history's stockpile of has-beens.</P>
<P>   Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel star in this classic
musical.  If you think that Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton
make good music together, you might change your mind
when you watch their characters, Lilli Vanessi as the Bard's
Katherine and Fred Graham as the great man's Petruchio
make goo-goo eyes at each other, fight like crazy, make goo-
goo eyes and fight--in either case showing that their
relationship by modern standards is too damn hot.</P>
<P>   The subplot involving a romance between Ann Miller's Lois
Lane in the "Taming" role of Bianca and Keenan Wynn's
Lippy doesn't match that fervor, but boy can Miss Ann dance. 
Her showstopping number, "Too Damn Hot," pops up almost
before you've put on your tinted glasses and you're on the
fast track with one of the hottest (if not entirely civilized)
pieces of choreography in musical theater history.</P>
<P>   Just think of how Shakespeare has been mangled in the
current production of "Love's Labour's Lost" which, ironically,
uses some of Cole Porter's songs, but the dances just plain
don't fit.  In this case, thanks to the genius of George Sidney
at the helm, there's never a dull moment nor a single
instance of a song or dance simply shoehorned in with no
bearing on the story.  So brush up your Porter if you must
have a background before seeing this, and go!</P>
